JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

 A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from "the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final." § 2255, P6(1). This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation. It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become "final" for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?

In accord with this Court's consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate  court mandate as the triggering date. For the purpose of starting the clock  on § 2255's one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction.

In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions. That court's mandate issued on December 15, 1998. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals' mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment). Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment, see this Court's Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court's mandate.

 On February 22, 2000 -- one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired -- Clay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Congress has prescribed "[a] 1-year period of limitation" for such motions "running from the latest of" four specified dates. § 2255, P6. Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: "the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final." § 2255, P6(1).

Relying on Gendron v. United States, 154 F.3d 672, 674 (CA7 1998)(per curiam), the District Court stated that "when a federal prisoner in this circuit does not seek certiorari . . ., the conviction becomes 'final' on the date the appellate court issues the mandate in the direct appeal." App. to Pet. for Cert.  8a. Because Clay filed his § 2255 motion  more than one year after that date, the court denied the motion as time barred.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed. That court declined Clay's "invitation to reconsider our holding in Gendron," although it acknowledged that Gendron's "construction of section 2255 represents the minority view." 30 Fed. Appx. 607, 609 (2002). "Bowing to stare decisis," the court expressed "reluctance to overrule [its own] recently-reaffirmed precedent without guidance from the Supreme Court." Ibid.

 The Fourth Circuit has agreed with Gendron's interpretation of § 2255. See United States v. Torres, 211 F.3d 836, 838-842 (2000) (when a federal prisoner does not  file a petition for certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for § 2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate). Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, § 2255's one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendant's time for seeking review by this Court expires. 1See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 39-42 (CA1 2002); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 567-577 (CA3 1999); United States v. Gamble, 208 F.3d 536, 537 (CA5 2000)(per curiam); United States v. Garcia, 210 F.3d 1058, 1059-1061 (CA9 2000); United States v. Burch, 202 F.3d 1274, 1275-1279 (CA10 2000); Kaufmann v. United States, 282 F.3d 1336, 1337-1339 (CA11 2002). To  secure uniformity in the application of § 2255's time constraint, we granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 957, 153 L. Ed. 2d 834, 122 S. Ct. 2658 (2002), and now reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgment. 2Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clay's § 2255 motion was timely filed. We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit's judgment. Mr. DeBruin's able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.

IIFinality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context. Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment. See, e.g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,517 U.S. 706, 712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1, 116 S. Ct. 1712 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 13, Comment b (1980). For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage. For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court's mandate. See Brief for Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 22-28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases). For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, "the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice)." This Court's Rule 13(3).

Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires. See, e.g., Caspari v. Bohlen,510 U.S. 383, 390, 127 L. Ed. 2d 236, 114 S. Ct. 948 (1994);Griffith v. Kentucky,479 U.S. 314, 321, n. 6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649, 107 S. Ct. 708 (1987);Barefoot v. Estelle,463 U.S. 880, 887, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 103 S. Ct. 3383 (1983);United States v. Johnson,457 U.S. 537, 542, n. 8, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202, 102 S. Ct. 2579 (1982);Linkletter v. Walker,381 U.S. 618, 622, n. 5, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, 85 S. Ct. 1731 (1965). Because "we presume that Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court's precedents," United States v. Wells,519 U.S. 482, 495, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997), our unvarying understanding  of finality for collateral review purposes would ordinarily determine the meaning of "becomes final" in § 2255.Amicus urges a different determinant, relying on verbal differences between § 2255 and a parallel statutory provision, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), which governs petitions for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners. See  DeBruin Brief 8-20. Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were reshaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. See §§ 101, 105, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220. Prior to that Act, no statute of limitations governed requests for federal habeas corpus or § 2255 habeas-like relief. See Vasquez v. Hillery,474 U.S. 254, 265, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598, 106 S. Ct. 617 (1986); United States v. Nahodil, 36 F.3d 323, 328 (CA3 1994). Like § 2255, § 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year limitation period, running from the latest of four specified dates. Three of the four time triggers under § 2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of § 2255. Compare §§ 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), with § 2255, PP6(2)-(4). But where § 2255, P6(1), refers simply to "the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final," § 2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of "the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." 3The Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted "direct review" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) to encompass review of a state conviction by this Court. See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d at 40-41; Williams v. Artuz, 237 F.3d 147, 151 (CA2 2001); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d at 575; Hill v. Braxton, 277 F.3d 701, 704 (CA4 2002); Ott v. Johnson, 192 F.3d 510, 513 (CA5 1999); Bronaugh v. Ohio, 235 F.3d 280, 283 (CA6 2000); Anderson v. Litscher, 281 F.3d 672, 674-675 (CA7 2002); Smith v. Bowersox, 159 F.3d 345, 347-348 (CA8 1998); Bowen v. Roe, 188 F.3d 1157, 1159 (CA9 1999); Locke v. Saffle, 237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (CA10 2001); Bond v. Moore, 309 F.3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002).

When "Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act," we have recognized, "it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." Russello v. United States,464 U.S. 16, 23, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17, 104 S. Ct. 296 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)). Invoking the maxim recited in Russello, amicus asserts that "becomes final" in § 2255, P6(1), cannot mean the same thing as "became final" in § 2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, amicus maintains, would render superfluous the words "by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review" -- words found only in the latter provision. DeBruin Brief 8-20. We can give effect to the discrete wording of the two prescriptions, amicus urges, if we adopt the following rule: When a convicted defendant does not seek certiorari on direct review, § 2255's limitation period starts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate. Id., at 36. 4Although recognizing that "the question is not presented in this case," Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that § 2255's limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari. Id., at 27-28, 36-38, 41-42. As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals "have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits," United States v. Hicks, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 279, 283 F.3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).

Amicus would have a stronger argument if § 2255, P6(1), explicitly incorporated the first of § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s finality formulations but not the second, so that the § 2255 text read "becomes final by the conclusion of direct review." Had § 2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in § 2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting § 2255 implicitly to incorporate § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s second trigger as well. As written, however, § 2255 does not qualify "becomes final" at all. Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words "became final" in § 2244(d)(1)(A), § 2255 simply leaves "becomes final" undefined.

Russello, we think it plain, hardly warrants the decision amicus urges, one that  would hold the § 2255 petitioner to  a tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by § 2244(d)(1)(A). Russello concerned the meaning of a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., that directed forfeiture to the United States of "any interest [a convicted defendant] has acquired . . . in violation of [the Act]." § 1963(a)(1). The petitioner in Russello urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words "any interest . . . acquired." Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, § 1963(a)(2), reached "any interest in . . . any enterprise" the defendant conducted in violation of RICO's proscriptions. At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by amicus. See supra, at 6. The qualifying words "in . . . any enterprise" narrowed § 1963(a)(2), but in no way affected § 1963(a)(1). The comparison of the two subsections, we said, "fortified" the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words "any interest . . . acquired." Russello, 464 U.S., at 22-23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 23 ("Had Congress intended to restrict § 1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following subsection (a)(2).").

Far from supporting the Seventh Circuit's constricted reading of § 2255, P6(1), Russello's reasoning tends in Clay's favor. An unqualified term -- here "becomes final" -- Russello indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than a pinpointed one -- here, § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s specification "became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review."

Moreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 7-8, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of "final" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) but not in § 2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to "became final" might have suggested that finality assessments  should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State. Cf.  Artuz v. Bennett,531 U.S. 4, 8, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (2000) (an application for state postconviction relief is "properly filed" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) "when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable [state] laws and rules governing filings"). The words "by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review" make it clear that finality for the purpose of § 2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal  system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.

Amicus also submits that 28 U.S.C. § 2263 "reinforces" the Seventh Circuit's understanding of § 2255. DeBruin Brief 20; accord, Torres, 211 F.3d at 840. Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners. Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from "final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review." That period is tolled, however, "from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review." § 2263(b)(1).

We do not find in § 2263 cause to alter our reading of § 2255. First, amicus' reliance on § 2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on § 2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, P6(1), refers to neither of the two events that § 2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period -- "affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review" and "the expiration of the time for seeking such review." Thus, reasoning by negative implication from § 2263 does not justify the conclusion that § 2255, P6(1)'s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other. Cf. supra, at 6-8. Second, § 2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to "affirmance of the conviction and sentence," while § 2255, P6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when "the judgment of conviction becomes final." See Torres, 211 F.3d at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting). "The Russello presumption -- that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress' design -- grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection." Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Service, Inc.,536 U.S. 424, 435-436, 153 L. Ed. 2d 430, 122 S. Ct. 2226 (2002).

* * *

We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, § 2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires. Under this rule, Clay's § 2255 petition was timely filed. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. 

In most of the United States, not including California, the minimum price paid to dairy farmers producing raw milk is regulated pursuant to federal marketing orders.  Those orders guarantee a uniform price for the producers, but through pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy products to pay different prices.  Thus, for example, processors of fluid milk pay a premium price, part of which goes into an equalization pool that provides a partial subsidy for cheese manufacturers who pay a net price that is lower than the farmers receive.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). 

 The California Legislature  has adopted a similar program to regulate the minimum prices paid by California processors to California producers. In the cases before us today, out-of-state producers are challenging the constitutionality of a 1997 amendment to that program.  They present us with two questions: (1) whether § 144 of the Federal Agriculture  Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 110 Stat 917, 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254], exempts California's milk pricing and pooling regulations from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause; and (2) whether the individual petitioners' claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause is foreclosed because  those regulations do not discriminate on their face on the basis of state citizenship or state residence. 

I 

Government regulation of the marketing of raw milk has been continuous since the Great Depression. 1The history and purpose of federal regulation of milk marketing is described in some detail inZuber v. Allen,396 U.S. 168, 172-187, 24 L. Ed. 2d 345, 90 S. Ct. 314 (1969). In California, three related statutes establish the regulatory structure for milk produced, processed, or sold in California.  First, in 1935, the State enacted the Milk Stabilization and Marketing Act, Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §§ 61801-62403 (West 2001), "to establish minimum producer prices at fair and reasonable levels so as to generate reasonable producer incomes that will promote the intelligent and orderly marketing of market milk . . ." § 61802(h).  Then, California created requirements for composition of milk products in the Milk and Milk Products Act of 1947. §§ 32501-39912.  The standards created under this Act mandate minimum percentages of fat and solids-not-fat in dairy products and often require fortification of milk by adding solids-not-fat. In 1967, California passed another milk pricing act, the Gonsalves Milk Pooling Act, §§ 62700-62731, to address deficiencies in the existing pricing scheme.  Together, these three Acts (including numerous subsequent revisions) create the state milk marketing structure: The 1935 and 1967 Acts establish the milk pricing and pooling plans, while the 1947 Act governs the composition of milk products sold in California. 

While it serves the same purposes as the federal marketing orders, California's regulatory program is more complex.   Federal orders typically guarantee all producers the same minimum price and create only two or three classes of end uses to determine the processors' contributions to, or withdrawals from, the equalization pools, whereas under the California scheme some of the farmers' production commands a "quota price" and some receives a lower "overbase price," and the processors' end uses of the milk are divided into five different classes. 

The complexities of the California scheme are not relevant to these cases; what is relevant is the fact California processors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes into a pool) that is higher than either of the prices paid to the producers. 2Because processors of fluid milk typically manufacture some other products as well, their respective pool contributions reflect the relative amounts of those end uses.  Each processor's mix of end uses produces an individual monthly "blend price" that is multiplied by its total purchases.  Under federal orders the term "blend price" has a different meaning; it usually refers to the price that the producer receives.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). During the early 1990's,  market conditions made it profitable for some California processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers at prices that were higher than either the quota prices or the overbase prices guaranteed to California farmers yet lower than the premium prices they had to pay when making in-state purchases.  The regulatory scheme was at least partially responsible for the advantage enjoyed by out-of-state producers because it did not require the processors to make any contribution to the equalization pool on such purchases.  In other words, whereas an in-state purchase of raw milk resold as fluid milk required the processor both to pay a guaranteed minimum to the farmer and also to make a contribution to the pool, an out-of-state purchase at a higher price would often be cheaper because it required no pool contribution. 

 In 1997, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its plan to require that contributions to the  pool be made on some out-of-state purchases. 3After the 1997 amendment, processors whose blend price exceeds the quota price must make contributions to the pool on their out-of-state purchases as well as their in-state purchases. It is the imposition of that requirement that gave rise to this litigation.  Petitioners in No. 01-950 operate dairy farms in Nevada; petitioners in No. 01-1018 operate such farms in Arizona.  They contend that the 1997 amendment discriminates against them.  In response, the California officials contend that it merely eliminated an unfair competitive advantage for out-of-state producers that was the product of the regulatory scheme itself. 

Without reaching the merits of petitioners' constitutional claims, the District Court dismissed both cases and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 259 F.3d 1148 (2001).  Relying on its earlier decision inShamrock Farms Co. v. Veneman, 146 F.3d 1177 (1998), the court held that a federal statute enacted in 1996 had immunized California's milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge.  It also held that the corporate petitioners had no standing to raise a claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that the individuals' claim under that Clause failed because the 1997 plan amendments did not "on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship." 259 F.3d at 1156.  We granted certiorari to review those two holdings,537 U.S. 522, 537 U.S. 1099, 154 L. Ed. 2d 766, 123 S. Ct. 818 (2003), but in doing so we do not reach the merits of either constitutional claim. 

II 

In some respects, the State's composition standards set forth in the 1947 Act exceed those set by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  For example, California's minimum standard for reduced fat milk requires that it contain at least 10 percent solids-not-fat (which include protein,  calcium, lactose and other nutrients).  Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. § 38211 (West 2001).  Federal standards require that reduced fat milk contain only 8.25 percent solids-not-fat.  See 21 CFR §§ 131.110, 101.62 (2002).  Some of California's standards were arguably pre-empted by Congress' enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA), 104 Stat 2353, which contains a prohibition against the application of state quality standards to foods moving in interstate commerce. See 21 U.S.C. § 343-1(a) [21 USCS § 343-1(a)]. The District Court so held in Shamrock Farms Co. v Veneman, No. Civ-S-95-318 (ED Cal 1996).  In response to that decision, California sought an exemption from both the FDA and Congress.  SeeShamrock Farms, 146 F.3d at 1180.  Before the FDA acted, Congress responded favorably with the enactment of the statute that governs our disposition of these cases.  That statute, § 144 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, provides: "Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise limit the authority of the State of California, directly or indirectly, to establish or continue to effect any law, regulation, or requirement regarding-- "(1) the percentage of milk solids or solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail or marketed in the State of California; or "(2) the labeling of such fluid milk products with regard to milk solids or solids not fat." 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254].

Thereafter, Shamrock Farms brought another suit against the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture challenging the validity of both the State's compositional standards and its milk pricing and pooling laws.  In that case, the Court of Appeals held that § 144 had immunized California's marketing programs as well as the compositional standards from a negative Commerce Clause challenge. Shamrock Farms,146 F.3d at 1182.  In adhering to that ruling in the cases before us today, the Ninth Circuit erred. 

 The text of the federal statute plainly covers California laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milk products, but does not mention laws regulating pricing. Congress certainly has the power to authorize state regulations that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce,Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,328 U.S. 408, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946), but we will not assume that it has done so unless such an intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke,467 U.S. 82, 91-92, 81 L. Ed. 2d 71, 104 S. Ct. 2237 (1984).While § 144 unambiguously expresses such an intent with respect to California's compositional and labeling laws, that expression does not encompass the pricing and pooling laws.  This conclusion is buttressed by the separate California statutes addressing the composition and labeling of milk products, on the one hand, and the pricing and pooling of milk on the other.  See supra, at 539 U.S. 59, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54, 59-60, 123 S. Ct. 2142 (2003).  The mere fact that the composition and labeling laws relate to the sale of fluid milk is by no means sufficient to bring them within the scope of § 144.  Because § 144 does not clearly express an intent to insulate California's pricing and pooling laws from a Commerce Clause challenge, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on § 144 to dismiss the challenge. 

 III 

 Article IV, § 2, of the Constitution provides: "The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States."

Petitioners, who include both individual dairy farmers and corporate dairies, have alleged that California's milk pricing laws violate that provision.  The Court of Appeals held that the corporate petitioners have no standing to advance such  a claim, and it rejected the individual petitioners' claims because the California laws "do not, on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship." 259 F.3d at 1156.  Petitioners do not challenge the first holding, but they contend that the second is inconsistent with our decision inChalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R. Co.,249 U.S. 522, 63 L. Ed. 748, 39 S. Ct. 366 (1919).  We agree. 

In Chalker, we held that a Tennessee tax imposed on a citizen and resident of Alabama for engaging in the business of constructing a railroad in Tennessee violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The tax did not on its face draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence.  It did, however, impose a higher rate on persons who had their principal offices out of State.  Taking judicial notice of the fact that "the chief office of an individual is commonly in the State of which he is a citizen," we concluded that the practical effect of the provision was discriminatory. Id., at 527, 63 L Ed 748, 39 S Ct 366.  Whether Chalker should be interpreted as merely applying the Clause to classifications that are but proxies for differential treatment against out-of-state residents, or as prohibiting any classification with the practical effect of discriminating against such residents, is a matter we need not decide at this stage of the case.  Under either interpretation, we agree with petitioners that the absence of an express statement in the California laws and regulations identifying out-of-state citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting this claim.  In so holding, however, we express no opinion on the merits of petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. * * * 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 We confront here the problem of a "mixed" petition for habeas corpus relief in which a state prisoner presents a federal court with a single petition containing some claims that have been exhausted in the state courts and some that have not.  More precisely, we consider whether a federal district court has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow the petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state  court in the first instance, and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition. 

 I 

Petitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in South Dakota state court of first-degree murder and third-degree burglary and sentenced to death.  His conviction became final on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petition for certiorari.  Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U.S. 1013, 136 L. Ed. 2d 410, 117 S. Ct. 522.  On December 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeas corpus.  App. 32.  The state court denied his petition, and the Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed on February 9, 2000, Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608 N.W.2d 303.Rhines filed his pro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254] in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000.  App 3.  Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was pending, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)], he still had more than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period. 

With the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhines filed an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and statement of exhaustion on November 20, 2000, asserting 35 claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sentence.  App. 39-60.  The State challenged 12 of those claims as unexhausted. Id., at 72-79.  On July 3, 2002, approximately 18 months after Rhines had filed his amended federal habeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 of the 35 claims had not been exhausted. At this time, the AEDPA 1-year statute of limitations had run.  See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001) (holding that the statute of limitations is not tolled during the pendancy of a federal petition).  As a result, if the District Court had dismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would  have been unable to refile in federal court after exhausting the unexhausted claims.   Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims to the South Dakota courts.  On July 3, 2002, the District Court granted the motion and issued a stay "conditioned upon petitioner commencing state court exhaustion proceedings within sixty days of this order and returning to this court within sixty days of completing such exhaustion." App. 136.  In compliance with that order, Rhines filed his second state habeas corpus petition on August 22, 2003. 

The State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines' mixed petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  Relying on its decision in Akins v. Kenney, 341 F.3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that "a district court has no authority to hold a habeas petition containing unexhausted claims in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances" (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court of Appeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims from his petition.  346 F.3d 799 (2003).  We granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Circuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's "stay-and-abeyance" procedure.  542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2905 (2004).  Compare, e.g., Crews v. Horn, 360 F.3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); and Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with 346 F.3d 799 (2003) (case below). 

II 

 Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, we held in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982), that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions for habeas corpus, that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims.  We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that state courts must have the first opportunity to decide a petitioner's claims. Id., at 518-519, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  We  noted that "[b]ecause 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courts apply the doctrine of comity." Id., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950)).  That doctrine "'teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.'" 455 U.S., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. 

 Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of "total exhaustion" and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court to present the unexhausted claims to that court in the first instance. Id., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  When we decided Lundy, there was no statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.  As a result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously unexhausted claims could come back to federal court to present their perfected petitions with relative ease.   See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000) (dismissal without prejudice under Lundy "contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion"). 

 The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically altered the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions.  AEDPA preserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] ("An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State"), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of limitations on the filing of federal petitions, § 2244(d).  Although the limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a "properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review," § 2244(d)(2), the filing of a petition for habeas  corpus in federal court does not toll the statute of limitations,  Duncan, 533 U.S. at 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120. 

 As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal court with "mixed" petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.  If a petitioner files a timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period has expired, this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.  For example, if the District Court in this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations would have barred Rhines from returning to federal court after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in state court.  Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner's chances of exhausting his claims in state court and refiling his petition in federal court before the limitations period runs are slim.  The problem is not limited to petitioners who file close to the AEDPA deadline.  Even a petitioner who files early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the  question of exhaustion. Thus, whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his case. 

 We recognize the gravity of this problem and the difficulty it has posed for petitioners and federal district courts alike.  In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts have adopted a version of the "stay-and-abeyance" procedure employed by the District Court below.  Under this procedure, rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to Lundy, a district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted claims.  Once the petitioner exhausts  his state remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court. 

District courts do ordinarily have authority to issue stays, see Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 81 L. Ed. 153, 57 S. Ct. 163 (1936), where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion, see Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945, 117 S. Ct. 1636 (1997).  AEDPA does not deprive district  courts of that authority, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] ("An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribe their discretion.  Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with AEDPA's purposes. 

 One of the statute's purposes is to "reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases." Woodford v. Garceau,538 U.S. 202, 206, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003).  See also Duncan, 533 U.S., at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA's 1-year limitations period "quite plainly serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments." Ibid. It "reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review." Ibid.

 Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdrop of Lundy's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in § 2244(d)(2) "balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period," "by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued." Duncan, supra, at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seek relief from state courts in the first instance by tolling the 1-year limitations period while a "properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review" is pending.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)].  This scheme reinforces the importance of Lundy's "simple and clear instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal court,  be sure that you first have taken each one to state court." 455 U.S., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. 

 Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the potential to undermine these twin purposes.  Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouraging finality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings.  It also undermines AEDPA's goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioner's incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court prior to filing his federal petition.  Cf. Duncan, supra, 533 U.S., at 180, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 ("[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in state court would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce"). 

 For these reasons, stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.  Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first in state court.  Moreover, even if a petitioner had good cause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him a stay when his unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.  Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(2)] ("An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the  failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State"). 

Even where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district court's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by the timeliness concerns reflected in AEDPA.  A mixed petition should not be stayed indefinitely.  Though, generally, a prisoner's "principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims," Lundy, supra, at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion), not all petitioners have an incentive to obtain federal relief as quickly as possible.  In particular, capital petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong their  incarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.  Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA's goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Thus, district courts should place reasonable time limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back.  See, e.g., Zarvela, 254 F.3d, at 381 ("[District courts] should explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing state court remedies within a brief interval, normally 30 days, after the stay is entered and returning to federal court within a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days after state court exhaustion is completed").  And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not grant him a stay at all.  See id., at 380-381. 

 On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition.  See Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (the total exhaustion requirement was not intended to "unreasonably impair the prisoner's right to relief").  In such a case, the petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.  For the same reason, if a petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and the court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, the court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.  See id., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion) ("[A petitioner] can always amend the petition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims"). 

 The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded that stay and abeyance is always impermissible.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for that court to determine, consistent with this opinion,  whether the District Court's grant of a stay in this case constituted an abuse of discretion. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The State of Alaska has invoked our original jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with the United States over title to certain submerged lands underlying waters located in southeast Alaska.  Alaska initiated the action by filing a complaint with leave of the Court.  530 U.S. 1228, 147 L. Ed. 2d 272, 120 S. Ct. 2681 (2000).  We appointed Professor Gregory E. Maggs to act as Special Master in this matter.  531 U.S. 941, 148 L. Ed. 2d 271, 121 S. Ct. 337 (2000).  The Special Master gave thorough consideration to the written and oral submissions of the parties.  In a detailed report he now recommends the grant of summary judgment to the United States with respect to all the submerged lands in dispute.  Report of Special Master 1 (hereinafter Report or Special Master's Report).  We set the case for oral argument on Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's Report.  543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 953, 160 L. Ed. 2d 314, 125 S. Ct. 458 (2004).  For the reasons we discuss, Alaska's exceptions are overruled. 

I 

 We begin by reviewing the general principles elaborated in the resolution of similar submerged lands disputes in our earlier cases. 

States enjoy a presumption of title to submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters within their boundaries and  beneath territorial waters within three nautical miles of their coasts. This presumption flows from two sources.  Under the established rule known as the equal footing doctrine, new States enter the Union "on an 'equal footing' with the original 13 Colonies and succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries." United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 5, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (1997)(Alaska (Arctic Coast)).Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq., which applies to Alaska through an express provision of the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), § 6(m), 72 Stat. 343, the presumption of state title to "lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States" is "confirmed" and "established." 43 U.S.C. § 1311(a); see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 5-6, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The SLA also "establishes States' title to submerged lands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea, which would otherwise be held by the United States." Id., at 6, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  "As a general matter, then, Alaska is entitled under both the equal footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under  the Submerged Lands Act alone to submerged lands extending three miles seaward of its coastline." Ibid.

 The Federal Government can overcome the presumption and defeat a future State's title to submerged lands by setting them aside before statehood in a way that shows an intent to retain title.  Id., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The requisite intent must, however, be "'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'" Id., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197 (1926)). 

With these principles in mind, we discuss the two areas of submerged land at issue here. 

II 

 The first area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska under alternative theories in counts I and II of its  amended complaint to quiet title (hereinafter Amended Complaint), consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands underlying waters in between and fringing the southeastern Alaska islands known as the Alexander Archipelago.  These disputed submerged lands, shown in red and dark blue on the map in Appendix A, infra, share a common feature: All points within the pockets and enclaves are more than three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or of any individual island of the Alexander Archipelago. 

For these pockets and enclaves, the dispositive question is whether the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as inland waters. If they do, Alaska's coastline would begin at the outer bounds of these inland waters as marked by the black line drawn on the map in Appendix A, infra. See 43 U.S.C. § 1301(c)("The term 'coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters"); see also United States v. Alaska, 422 U.S. 184, 187-188, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240, and n. 5 (1975)(Alaska (Cook Inlet)).Under the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, a presumption of state title would then arise as to all the submerged lands underlying both the inland waters landward of this coastline, and also the territorial sea within three nautical miles of it.  Because the United States concedes it could not rebut the presumption of state title as to this aspect of the case, Alaska would have title to all the pockets and enclaves of submerged lands in dispute. 

If the Alexander Archipelago's waters do not qualify as inland, then they instead qualify as territorial sea. In that case Alaska would have no claim of title to the disputed pockets and enclaves, as these lands are beyond three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or any individual island. 

 The second area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska in count IV of its Amended Complaint, consists of the submerged land beneath Glacier Bay, a well-marked indentation into the coast of the southeast Alaskan mainland. See  Appendixes C, D, infra (maps of Glacier Bay).  There is no question that Glacier Bay's waters are inland. For the submerged lands underlying these waters, the controlling question is whether the United States can rebut Alaska's presumption of title. 

 After receiving the parties' written submissions and conducting a hearing, the Special Master recommended that this Court grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claims of title to both areas of submerged land in dispute.  Report 1.  As to the pockets and enclaves, the Special Master concluded that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago do not qualify as inland waters either under the historic inland waters theory advanced in count I of Alaska's Amended Complaint or under the juridical bay theory advanced in count II.  Id., at 137-138, 226.  As to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and claimed by Alaska in count IV, the Special Master concluded that the United States has rebutted the presumption that title passed to Alaska at statehood. Id., at 276.  Alaska filed exceptions to each of these three conclusions.  We address them in turn. 

III 

 In count I of its Amended Complaint, Alaska alleges that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago are historic inland waters. As this Court has recognized, "where a State within the United States wishes to claim submerged lands based on an area's status as historic inland waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States:  (1) exercises authority over the area; (2) has done so continuously; and (3) has done so with the acquiescence of foreign nations." Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 11, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  "For this showing," we have elaborated, "the exercise of sovereignty must have been, historically, an assertion of power to exclude all foreign vessels and navigation." Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. 

 Nations may exclude from inland waters even vessels engaged in so-called "innocent passage"--passage that "is not  prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State," Arts. 14(1), 14(4) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U. S. T. 1607, 1610 T. I. A. S. No. 5639 (hereinafter Convention).  See United States v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 93, 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074 (1985)(Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case);United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S. 11, 22, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773 (1969).  To claim a body of water as historic inland water, it is therefore important to establish that the right to exclude innocent passage has somehow been asserted, even if never actually exercised.  See Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, 470 U.S., at 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074.  The Court also has considered the "vital interests of the United States" in designating waters as historic inland waters. Id., at 103, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074. 

 The Special Master recommended that the Court grant summary judgment to the United States on this count.  The Special Master first made a thorough examination of historical documents, from 1821 to the present, bearing on the status of the Alexander Archipelago's waters. The Special Master sorted these documents into five distinct periods: (1) Russian sovereignty (1821-1867), Report 23-38; (2) early American sovereignty (1867-1903), id., at 38-55; (3) the 1903 US-Britain Boundary  Arbitration, id., at 56-63; (4) later American sovereignty (1903-1959), id., at 63-89; and (5) the poststatehood era (1959-present), id., at 89-107.  Based on his examination of the record evidence from all of these periods, the Special Master concluded that "Russia and the United States historically did not assert authority to exclude vessels from making innocent passage through the waters of the Alexander Archipelago." Id., at 109.  In the Special Master's view, Alaska had at best "uncovered and presented only 'questionable evidence' that the United States exercised the kind of authority over the waters of the Archipelago that would be necessary to prove a historic waters claim." Id., at 129. 

 Though Alaska's failure to demonstrate that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago had historically been treated as inland waters would by itself justify granting summary judgment to the United States on count I, the Special Master also addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other nations and the vital interests of the United States.  In the Special Master's view these factors only strengthened the case for granting summary judgment to the United States. 

Excepting to the Special Master's recommendation on count I, Alaska contends the Special Master gave too little weight to historical events that tend to support Alaska's position.  By the same token Alaska argues the Special Master gave too much weight to historical events that tend to undermine its position.  Alaska also asserts that foreign nations have acquiesced in the treatment of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the United States support such treatment.  We find Alaska's arguments unconvincing. 

 Rather than canvassing the entire historical record discussed by the Special Master in his thorough, commendable report, we turn our attention to the events Alaska presents as its best evidence that the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as historic inland waters. 

A 

 First in time among the events to which Alaska points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereignty.  These incidents are pertinent to the inquiry because, as we have held, when Russia ceded the territory of Alaska to the United States in 1867, "the United States thereby acquired whatever dominion Russia had possessed." Alaska (Cook Inlet), 422 U.S., at 192, n. 13, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. 

 In 1824, the United States and Russia entered into a treaty that, inter alia, granted United States vessels the right, over  the next 10 years, to "frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas, gulphs, harbours, and creeks [of the Alexander Archipelago], for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives of the country." See Convention Between the United States of America and Russia, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304 (1825) (hereinafter 1824 Treaty or Treaty).  In Alaska's view this Treaty demonstrates that "the Russian claim extended to the entire Archipelago" and thus that Russia treated the archipelago waters as inland waters. Exceptions to Report of Special Master and Brief in Support for Plaintiff 29 (hereinafter Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska).  The principal problem with Alaska's assertion is that the 1824  Treaty by its terms did not address navigation for the purpose of innocent passage, but rather addressed only navigation "for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives." Even on the questionable assumption that the Treaty's reference to "interior seas" included all the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and not just waters within three nautical miles of the coast of the mainland or any particular island, but see Report 27-28 (refuting this assumption), the Treaty simply does not provide evidence that Russia asserted a right to exclude innocent passage.  Yet evidence of the assertion of this right--not some lesser right--must be provided to support an historic inland waters claim.  See Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. 

Upon the expiration of the 10-year right granted to United States vessels by virtue of the 1824 Treaty, Russia stationed a brig, theChichagoff, at the southern border of Russian America.  Alaska implies that Russia's purpose in stationing the brig there was to exclude any foreign vessels from entering the Alexander Archipelago's waters. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30-31.  Were we to accept this interpretation of the Chichagoff incident, we would acknowledge it as some evidence that Russia treated the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland waters. 

 As the Special Master noted, however, a report prepared for the 1903 Alaskan Boundary Tribunal (a tribunal we will discuss further) described the Chichagoff incident as follows: "Governor Wrangell sent the brig Chichagoff, under command of Lieutenant Zarembo, to Tongas, near the southern boundary line at 54degree 40ft, for the purpose of intercepting foreign vessels entering the inland waters of the colony, to the masters of which he was to deliver written notice of the expiration of the treaty provisions, being furnished with six copies for American and three for British vessels." 1 Proceedings of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal, S. Doc. No. 162, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p 70 (1904) (hereinafter ABT proceedings) (footnote omitted).

Like the Special Master, we see nothing in this passage to indicate that Russia, through its actions with respect to the Chichagoff, asserted a right to exclude from the Alexander Archipelago waters foreign vessels engaged only in innocent passage.  By giving written notice of the expiration of the 1824 Treaty rights, the Chichagoff reminded American mariners that they were no longer free to trade with the natives, or to approach within cannon shot of the Russian lands "without any hindrance whatever." 1824 Treaty, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304.  Russia did not assert thereby the more sweeping right to exclude even vessels engaged only in innocent passage. 

Alaska also points to evidence that in 1836 Russian forces apprehended and boarded the American vessel Loriot while it was within the Alexander Archipelago waters, and then ordered it "'to leave the waters of His Imperial Majesty.'" Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30; see also Letter from John Forsyth to G. M. Dallas (May 4, 1837), reprinted in Report of Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard upon the Seal Fisheries in the Bering Sea, S. Exec. Doc. No. 106, 50th Cong., 2d Sess., 232-233 (1889).  Even this incident does  not  constitute evidence that Russia viewed the archipelago waters as inland waters, however, because the Loriot was not engaged in innocent passage.  The Loriot's mission, as freely admitted in a contemporary letter written by a State Department official to a member of the United States legation in St. Petersburg, was to visit "the northwest coast of America, for the purpose of procuring provisions, and also Indians to hunt for sea otter on the said coast." Id., at 232.  By excluding the Loriot, which evidently had tried to exceed the limits of mere "innocent passage," Russia did not, and could not, assert a right to exclude vessels engaged solely in innocent passage. 

In sum, none of the incidents Alaska cites from the period of Russian sovereignty support the proposition that Russia treated the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters prior to ceding Alaska to the United States in 1867. 

B 

For the period of early U.S. sovereignty between 1867 and 1903, Alaska cites not a single incident demonstrating that the United States acted in a manner consistent with an understanding that the Alexander Archipelago waters were inland. Alaska thus leaves itself with at most 56 years to demonstrate continuous prestatehood treatment of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters. This alone constitutes a substantial weakness in Alaska's position. 

As to the years between 1867 and 1903, Alaska does attempt to explain away a significant event which undercuts its claim, but this attempt is unsuccessful.  In 1886, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard wrote a letter to Secretary of Treasury Daniel Manning concerning the limits of the territorial waters of the United States on both the northeastern and the northwestern coasts. See 1 J. Moore, Digest of International Law 718-721 (1906).  The State Department's position with respect to waters surrounding fringing islands on both coasts was that the sovereigns of those islands could  only claim a territorial sea of three miles from the coast of each island. Secretary Bayard explained that, in asserting the 3-mile belt of territorial sea, the United States denied neither "the free right of vessels of other nations to pass, on peaceful errands, through this zone" nor the right "of relief, when suffering from want of necessities, from the shore." Id., at 720-721. 

According to Secretary Bayard, the State Department's position was a well-considered one, rooted in principles of reciprocity and consistent practice: "These rights we insist on being conceded to our fishermen in the northeast, where the mainland is under the British sceptre.  We can not refuse them to others on our northwest coast, where the sceptre is held by the United States.  We asserted them . . . against Russia, thus denying to her jurisdiction beyond three miles on her own marginal seas. We can not claim greater jurisdiction against other nations, of seas washing territories which we derived from Russia under the Alaska purchase." Id., at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Special Master singled out this letter as "unambiguously support[ing] the United States' position that the United States and Russia historically  did not assert the right to exclude foreign vessels from the waters of the Archipelago." Report 109.  Emphasizing the statements in the letter that the United States could not "'claim greater jurisdiction'" than three miles of marginal seas and that foreign vessels had the right to make "'free transit,'" the Special Master concluded that "[o]fficials who held this belief could not, and evidently did not, claim that the United States could exclude innocent passage through the waters." Id., at 110. 

Alaska argues that Secretary Bayard's letter is of minimal relevance because "it was internal correspondence that primarily addressed a dispute on the East coast" and thus "did not announce to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago." Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 31-32.  Alaska's arguments are unpersuasive.  That Secretary Bayard's letter referred to the east coast in no way diminishes the unequivocal nature of its statements with respect to the Alaskan coast. It may be true that no foreign nation ever became aware of Secretary Bayard's letter (though the subsequent publication of the letter in the United States' Digest of International Law gives us reason to believe the contrary).  Regardless, Secretary Bayard's letter still provides strong evidence that the United States, as of 1886, did not claim a right to exclude all foreign vessels from the Alexander Archipelago waters and had no intention of doing so.  We do not need to parse the letter to see whether it "announce[d] to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago," for Alaska can muster no proof that the United States as of 1886 had made any such claim in the first place. 

C 

A stronger piece of evidence Alaska identifies to support its historic inland waters claim is a litigating position taken by the United States during an arbitration proceeding in 1903.  This proceeding was before the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, a body convened to resolve a dispute between the United States and Britain regarding the land boundary between southeastern Alaska and Canada.  Report 56-63, 116-119. 

In a written submission to the tribunal, the United States described its view of the "political coast" of Alaska as enclosing all of the Alexander Archipelago waters, as shown on the map in Appendix A, infra. 4 ABT Proceedings, pt. 1, pp 31-32 (1903).  According to the United States' submissions, "[t]he boundary of Alaska,--that is, the exterior boundary from which the marine league [of the territorial sea] is measured,--runs along the outer edge of the Alaskan or Alexander Archipelago, embracing a group composed of  hundreds of islands." 5 id., pt. 1, at 15-16.  At oral argument before the tribunal, moreover, counsel for the United States made explicit that the recognition of such a "political coast" would render all waters landward of it "just as much interior waters as the interior waters of Loch Lomond." 7 id., at 611 (1904). 

Before the Special Master in the instant case, the United States sought to discount as mere hypothetical statements the submissions it had made at the tribunal a full century prior.  The Special Master rejected this view and instead agreed  with Alaska that in its submissions to the tribunal the United States "was expressing a considered analysis of the [Alexander Archipelago] area, not merely speaking hypothetically for the purpose of showing a flaw in Britain's argument." Report 61.  Ultimately, however, the Special Master still concluded that the United States' submissions to the tribunal were "not an adequate assertion of authority over the waters of the Alexander Archipelago." Id., at 118.  The Special Master noted that the issue before the 1903 tribunal was not "[t]he status of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago," ibid., but rather the land boundary between southeast Alaska and Canada; that the United States' declarations regarding the status of the Alexander Archipelago took up "only a few paragraphs in a seven volume record"; and that "[f]or these reasons, it would be unrealistic to conclude that counsel's assertions at the tribunal should have made foreign nations (other than Britain) aware that the United States was asserting a right to exclude them." Ibid.

 Alaska responds that the Special Master was incorrect to conclude that the United States' submissions in 1903 could not have made foreign nations other than Britain aware of its claim.  Alaska argues that Norway became aware of the United States' submissions and then relied on them in its dispute with the United Kingdom in the well-known Fisheries Case (U. K. v. Nor.), 1951 I. C. J. 116 (Judgment of Dec. 18).  As the Special Master explained, however, "[t]he ability  of one foreign nation to discover the United States' argument when litigating a related issue . . . does not mean that foreign nations should have known of the United States' position." Report 118, n 34.  This reasoning carries particular force in light of the precedent a contrary conclusion would create.  If this Court were to recognize historic inland waters claims based on arguments made by counsel during litigation about nonmaritime boundaries, "the United States would itself become vulnerable to similarly weak claims by other nations that would restrict the freedom of the seas." Reply Brief for United States in Response to Exceptions of the State of Alaska 15-16 (hereinafter Reply Brief for United States).  We are reluctant to create a precedent that would have this effect. 

D 

 The litigating position taken by the United States at the ABT Proceedings at best would provide weak support for inland status of the Alexander Archipelago waters even were we to accept it as signaling a significant change from the view expressed in Secretary Bayard's letter of 1886; for there is little evidence that the United States later acted in a manner consistent with this litigating position.  Alaska says that the United States asserted control over the waters by enacting and enforcing fishery regulations in the Alexander Archipelago during the first half of the 20th century.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 25-29.  In particular, Alaska cites the 1906 Alien Fishing Act, 34 Stat. 263, which prohibited foreign, but not domestic, commercial fishing "in any of the waters of Alaska." As its sole evidence that the Act was enforced even in the pockets and enclaves at issue, Alaska cites the seizure by the United States Coast Guard in 1924 of the Canadian vessel Marguerite,  whose captain was fined $100 for fishing in contravention of the Act. 

Assuming, arguendo, that the Marguerite was seized in one of the disputed pockets or enclaves, a point which the Special Master found unclear, Report 67-68, this one incident  hardly suffices to demonstrate a continuous policy.  Indeed, contrary authority exists.  In 1934 the Departments of State and Commerce exchanged letters expressing their shared understanding that the United States lacked the power to enforce the Act more than three miles from the shore of any island or the mainland. Id., at 70-71 (quoting Letter from Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to Secretary of State 1 (Sept. 5, 1934)("'Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three mile limit'" ); and Letter from William Phillips, Under Secretary of State, to Secretary of Commerce 1 (Sept. 13, 1934) (expressing appreciation for the assurance "'that the Fishery laws and regulations will be enforced by the Bureau of Fisheries in conformity with the view that Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three-mile limit'".  This understanding was inconsistent with a view of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland. Report 70-71, 110-111. 

Even were the seizure of the Marguerite taken as evidence of a right asserted by the United States in 1924, the official correspondence cited by the Special Master establishes that by 1934 the United States had reverted to the position taken in Secretary Bayard's 1886 letter.  As the United States observes, furthermore, the fact that Britain protested the seizure of the Marguerite indicates that any claim of right implied from that seizure was not one in which foreign nations acquiesced.  Reply Brief for United States 17, n 10. 

Alaska also refers to various poststatehood events which, in its view, confirm the status of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland waters. We find insufficient prestatehood evidence to establish inland waters status in the first place, and so we find it unnecessary to discuss these further events. 

 At best, Alaska's submissions before this Court establish that the United States made one official statement--in the 1903 Alaska Boundary Arbitration--describing the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland, and that the United States seized one foreign vessel--the Marguerite--in a manner arguably consistent with the status of those waters as inland. These incidents are insufficient to demonstrate the continuous assertion of exclusive authority, with acquiescence of foreign nations, necessary to support an historic inland waters claim.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count I of the Amended Complaint is overruled. 

IV 

 In count II of its Amended Complaint, Alaska presents an alternative theory to justify treating the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland. Alaska's alternative theory is that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago in truth consist of two vast, but as yet unnoticed, juridical bays.  Waters within a juridical bay would be deemed inland waters. Art. 5(1) of the Convention, 15 U. S. T., at 1609. Thus, if accepted, Alaska's  theory would render all the Alexander Archipelago's waters inland waters to the extent they lie within the limits of the bays Alaska identifies.  For this reason, and because the United States would not be able to rebut the presumption of title that would arise from inland waters status, Alaska's alternative theory would require the Court to accept Alaska's claim of title to the pockets and enclaves in dispute. 

 The parties agree that Alaska's claimed juridical bays would exist only if four of the Alexander Archipelago's islands--Kuiu Island, Kupreanof Island, Mitkof Island, and Dry Island--were deemed to be connected to each other and to the mainland. We have recognized that such "assimilat[ion]" of islands fringing the mainland is possible, albeit only in "exceptional case[s]" in which "an island or group of islands . . . 'are so integrally related to the mainland that they are realistically parts of the "coast."'" United States v. Maine, 469 U.S. 504, 517, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992 (1985) (quoting United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S., at 66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773).  If the assimilation Alaska urges were accepted, the four islands Alaska has identified  would form a constructive peninsula extending from the mainland and dividing the Alexander Archipelago's waters in two.  To bolster its case, Alaska labels the waters north and south of this hypothetical peninsula the "North Bay" and the "South Bay." See Appendix B, infra (map showing Alaska's hypothetical peninsula and the resulting bays). 

 Were we to accept Alaska's hypothetical peninsula, we would then be required to determine whether North Bay and South Bay in fact qualify as juridical bays under the Convention, which we have customarily consulted for purposes of "determining the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters of the States." United States v. Maine, supra, at 513, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  Article 7(2) of the Convention sets forth the following geographic criteria for deciding whether a body of water qualifies as a bay: "For the purposes of these articles, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation." 15 U. S. T., at 1609.

This definition can be understood to comprise a number of elements.  To apply the definition to a given body of water, one must first determine whether the body of water satisfies the descriptive test of being a "well-marked indentation." One must then determine, among other things, whether the indentation's area satisfies the mathematical "semi-circle" test set forth in the second sentence of Article 7(2). 

 After due consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended that the Court reject Alaska's alternative theory.  The Special Master first conducted a detailed assessment of the propriety of assimilating the four  islands in question in order to form the constructive peninsula so critical to Alaska's theory.  Report 147-197.  Applying  the principles set forth in United States v. Maine, supra, at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, and United States v. Louisiana, supra, at 60-66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773, the Special Master concluded that assimilation would be unwarranted save for two inconsequential channels that "do not suffice to create the juridical bays alleged by Alaska." Report 197.  In the alternative, the Special Master concluded that, even were Alaska's hypothetical peninsula accepted, neither "North Bay" nor "South Bay" could satisfy the descriptive test that a proposed bay constitute a "'well-marked indentation.'" Id., at 222. 

Excepting to the Special Master's recommendations, Alaska makes a detailed argument that this Court's precedents regarding assimilation of islands support recognition of the constructive peninsula Alaska has identified.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 39-45.  Alaska further contends that, once this peninsula is recognized, the resulting bodies of water satisfy all the criteria set forth in the Convention.  Id., at 45-49. 

We overrule Alaska's exception.  For the sake of brevity we assume, arguendo, that each of the islands in Alaska's hypothetical peninsula should be assimilated one to another (though we are aware of, and Alaska itself cites, no precedent foreign or domestic in which such a massive amount of successive assimilation has been accepted for the purpose of identifying a juridical bay).  Even with the benefit of this daunting doubt Alaska could not prevail, for its hypothetical bays do not satisfy the Convention's descriptive requirement of being well-marked indentations. 

 To qualify as a well-marked indentation, a body of water must possess physical features that would allow a mariner looking at navigational charts that do not depict bay closing lines nonetheless to perceive the bay's limits, and hence to avoid illegal encroachment into inland waters. See G. Westerman, The Juridical Bay 82-85 (1987).  Alaska's hypothetical  bays do not possess these features.  We have been referred to no authority which indicates that a mariner looking at an unadorned map of the southeast Alaskan coast has ever discerned the limits of Alaska's hypothetical bays.  So subtle are these limits that even Alaska itself did not discover them until after it had filed its first complaint in this action.  Compare Complaint to Quiet Title (Nov. 24, 1999) with Amended Complaint (Dec. 14, 2000).  The test is what mariners see, not what litigators invent.  Alaska's hypothetical bays would not be discernible to the eye of the mariner. 

 A comparison to United States v. Maine, 469 U.S., at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, makes clear the force of our conclusion.  In that case the Court considered whether Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound together qualify as a juridical bay.  In determining that they do, the Court held that Long Island itself should be assimilated to the mainland. Id., at 517-520, 83 L. Ed 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  The Court then determined that the resulting indentation formed by Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound satisfied the requirements of Article 7(2) of the Convention, including the descriptive requirement of being a "well-marked indentation." Id., at 515, 519, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992. 

 There is a critical difference between this body of water and the bodies of water Alaska has christened as North Bay and South Bay.  Even before this Court held that Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound qualified together as a juridical bay, mariners and geographers had recognized Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound as adjacent, cohesive bodies of water--indeed, as "sound[s]," which itself is a term used to describe a wide and deep bay, or a strait connecting other bodies of water. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2176 (1981) (defining "sound" as "a long and rather broad inlet of the ocean generally with its larger part extending roughly parallel to the coast"; "a long passage of water connecting two larger bodies but too wide and extensive to be termed a strait").  Nothing of the sort can be said of Alaska's claimed bays.  It is not just that no mariner and  no geographer (and not even Alaska's litigators) before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as bays or sounds.  It appears that no one before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as constituting cohesive bodies of water at all. 

 Even accepting the constructive peninsula Alaska has crafted out of four separate islands within the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska's claimed bays still fail to qualify as "well-marked indentations" for purposes of the Convention.  For this reason, we reject the alternative theory Alaska urges in count II of its Amended Complaint.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on this count is overruled. 

V 

 In count IV of its Amended Complaint, Alaska claims title to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument (now known as Glacier Bay National Park), located at the northern end of the Alexander Archipelago.  Concluding that the United States had rebutted Alaska's presumed title to these lands, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States.  As with the other aspects of this case, the Special Master was correct in his interpretation and application of the controlling precedents and principles, and we overrule Alaska's exception to his recommendation. 

A 

 The centerpiece of Glacier Bay National Park is Glacier Bay itself.  By contrast to the bays Alaska claims in count II, Glacier Bay is a textbook example of a juridical bay.  Its waters mark a dramatic indentation within the coastline of the Alaskan mainland. While the width of Glacier Bay's mouth measures 5 miles at most, the bay's waters stretch more than 60 miles into the mainland. See Appendix C, infra (map of Glacier Bay). 

Glacier Bay National Park is one of the Nation's largest national parks, embracing over 3.2 million acres, an area  larger than the State of Connecticut.  Rennicke, North to Wild Alaska, National Geographic Traveler 48, 55 (July/Aug. 1994).  John Muir, who first saw the bay and its surroundings in 1879, described it as a "'solitude of ice and snow and newborn rocks.'" Id., at 56.  One way to comprehend the solitude is to note that in the area of  Glacier Bay there are still not more than 10 miles of established hiking trails.  See id., at 50.  As the world's largest marine sanctuary, it is, in one sense, a water park. 

A ship in the waters of the Pacific in the Gulf of Alaska reaches Glacier Bay by heading shoreward to the east through Cross Sound and to Bartlett Cove, there turning to proceed through the bay in a generally northwest direction.  See Appendix D, infra. The entrance to the bay near Bartlett Cove is about 100 miles northwest of Juneau and still 600 miles southeast of Anchorage. 

The bay owes its name to Captain Beardslee of the United States Navy, who, upon first entering the bay in 1880, was so impressed by the ice formations surrounding it that he called it Glacier Bay.  5 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 290 (15th ed. 2003).  A glacier is a large formation of perennial ice.  The definition used by the Special Master was a "'mixture of ice and rock that moves downhill over a bed of solid rock or sediment under the influence of gravity.'" Report 246.  Some of the glaciers in the region are tidewater glaciers, so called because they end at the water's edge.  Even large ships must take precautions near these glaciers, for ice can break off (a process called calving); and when a large segment plunges to the sea, it becomes an iceberg.  Ibid.

The weight of a glacier can cause it to move, either advancing to crush the life before it or receding to allow life forms to begin anew.  At Glacier Bay some of the glaciers are advancing, some are receding, and others seem to be stable.  See id., at 246-247. 

At least in Glacier Bay, the extreme slowness suggested by the term "glacial" is inapt, for the ice once present where  the bay now extends receded with (in a geological context) astounding speed.  When Captain George Vancouver visited in 1794, the bay was but 5 miles inward from Bartlett Cove, while today it penetrates inland for over 60 miles. This retreat of the ice is "considered the fastest glacial withdrawal in recorded history.  'Unzipping,' the geologists call it.  The landscape dancing in geologic time." Rennicke, supra, at 56.  The advance and retreat of the glaciers are of great interest to scientists, and in the areas of glacial recession the submerged floor of the bay is contoured or sculptured in ways that can be studied to learn more of glacial movement and geologic formations.  See Report 246-248. 

The immense scene is one of remarkable beauty, and the waters, which accommodate large vessels, can be calm enough so that kayaks can be used to explore the bay and its surroundings.  Where glaciers have retreated either in the bay or on shore, the retreat reveals how a new life cycle begins.  Plant succession is of absorbing interest.  "It can be almost like a chant: lichens and algae, moss and dryas, fireweed, willows, alder, and spruce." Rennicke, supra, at 56. 

The bay and the surrounding shore and forest areas of the park sustain a chain of fish, bird, and animal life.  Over 200 avian species have been noted, most of these in or near the marine environment.  Glacier Bay: A Guide to Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska 78 (1983).  There are mussels and crabs on the shore, and in the bay's waters there are numerous fish, including herring  and salmon.  The light in the long days of summer, and the oxygen-rich waters, accelerate phytoplankton populations, and this is part of the food chain working up to the herring and salmon, then porpoises, seals, and sea lions.  The bay also has whales, including the humpback whale.  K. Jettmar, Alaska's Glacier Bay: A Traveler's Guide 53 (1997). 

In the 1930's, when naturalists and other observers were supporting the movement to expand Glacier Bay National  Monument beyond its initial boundaries, the brown bear became the flagship species for the cause.  Declaration of Theodore R. Catton 51, Exhibits to Reply of United States in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Count IV of Amended Complaint, Tab No. 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-3).  One of the largest of omnivores, the brown bear's food in estuarine areas includes "vegetation, invertebrates (clams, mussels, worms, barnacles, amphipods), carcasses of fish and marine mammals washed onto the beach, and winter-killed ungulates . . . ." Declaration of Victor Barnes 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-6).  Brown bears find salmon in streams, and (with distressing frequency) they can swim to the small islands to raid the nesting places of birds and water fowl.  Id., at 9.  When bears swim in the bay, they are particularly vulnerable to hunters.  When he was considering the proposal to extend the boundaries of the Glacier Bay National Monument, President Franklin Roosevelt was angered by accounts of bears being shot from pleasure yachts.  Id., at 16. 

 Reference to the complex ecosystem of Glacier Bay and the surrounding land is important for understanding the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. These purposes, in turn, inform the inquiry whether title to the submerged land underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument passed to Alaska at statehood. See Idaho v. United States, 533 U.S. 262, 274, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135 (2001) (describing the inquiry as encompassing the question whether "the purpose of the reservation would have been compromised if the submerged lands had passed to the State"); Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 42-43, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (noting that "defeating state title . . . was necessary to achieve the United States' objective [of] securing a supply of oil and gas that would necessarily exist beneath uplands and submerged lands"). 

B 

 Owing to Glacier Bay's status as a juridical bay, its waters qualify as inland navigable waters. All the remaining waters  within the boundaries of Glacier Bay National Monument as it existed at statehood, moreover, lie less than three nautical miles from the coastline.  Under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, therefore, a strong presumption arises that title to the lands underlying all the waters in dispute in count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint passed to Alaska at statehood. See supra, at 545 U.S. 75, 125 S. Ct. 2137, 162 L. Ed. 2d, 57, 69, 70; see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 33-36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 213, 117 S. Ct. 1888.The controlling question here is whether the United States can rebut this presumption. 

 It is now settled that the United States can defeat a future  State's presumed title to submerged lands not only by conveyance to third parties but also by setting submerged lands aside as part of a federal reservation "such as a wildlife refuge." Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135; Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  To ascertain whether Congress has made use of that power, we conduct a two-step inquiry.  We first inquire whether the United States clearly intended to include submerged lands within the reservation. If the answer is yes, we next inquire whether the United States expressed its intent to retain federal title to submerged lands within the reservation. Id., at 36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888; Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135.  "We will not infer an intent to defeat a future State's title to inland submerged lands 'unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'" Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). 

 After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States on Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay.  Report 227-276.  His recommendation rested on two conclusions that track the two-part test developed in our precedents.  First, he concluded that in creating Glacier Bay National Monument the United States had reserved the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and the remaining waters within the monument's boundaries.  Id., at 264.  Second, he concluded that § 6(e) of the ASA, 72 Stat. 340-341, note preceding 48 U.S.C. § 21, p 320, expressed Congressional intent to retain those submerged lands in federal ownership.  Report 276. 

Alaska takes exception only to the Special Master's second conclusion.  We nonetheless explain the Special Master's first conclusion (and our own), for it is a necessary part of the reasoning for the second step of the analysis. 

C 

We need not detain ourselves long with the first part of the test regarding title to submerged lands.  In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. § 431 et seq., to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Proclamation No. 1733,43 Stat. 1988(1925 Proclamation).  In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation expanding the monument to include all of Glacier Bay's waters and to extend the monument's western boundary three nautical miles out to sea. Proclamation No. 2330, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939) (1939 Proclamation).  See Appendix C, infra (depicting both the initial boundaries established by the 1925 Proclamation and the expanded boundaries established by the 1939 Proclamation).  In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a proclamation slightly altering the monument's boundaries, but leaving the bay's waters within them.  Proclamation No. 3089, 3 CFR 24 (Supp. 1955) (1955 Proclamation).  In 1980, Congress designated the monument as part of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and expanded the resulting reservation's boundaries.  16 U.S.C. § 410hh-2; see Appendix D, infra (map of Glacier Bay National Park).  For present purposes, however, the important point is that by the time Alaska achieved statehood in 1959, the Glacier Bay National Monument had already existed for 34 years as a federal reservation. 

After considering the evidence submitted by both parties, the Special Master concluded that "the Glacier Bay National  Monument, as it existed at the time of statehood, clearly included the submerged lands within its boundaries." Report 263-264.  According to the Special Master, the descriptions of the monument in the 1925, 1939, and 1955 Proclamations themselves showed that the monument embraced submerged lands.  Id., at 232-242.  The Special Master also considered it significant that exclusion of the submerged lands would have undermined at least three of the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Exclusion of the submerged lands would impair scientific study of the majestic tidewater glaciers surrounding the bay.  Id., at 245-251.  It would also impair efforts both to study and to preserve the remnants of "'interglacial forests,'" which can be found both above and below the tideline.  Id., at 251-253.  Finally, exclusion of the submerged lands would compromise the goal of safeguarding the flora and fauna that thrive in Glacier Bay's complex and interdependent ecosystem.  Id., at 253-263. 

The Special Master, in our view, had ample support for his conclusions that all of these were purposes for creation of the monument, and each would be compromised were it to be determined that submerged lands were not included in the monument. His ultimate determination, that Glacier Bay National Monument included the submerged lands within its boundaries, has strong support in the precedents and in the whole record of the case.  Alaska has not filed a formal exception to this determination, and the four-sentence footnote in Alaska's brief which expresses disagreement with it, Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 10-11, n 4, does not in our view suffice to impeach its validity. 

D 

Having established the proposition that the Glacier Bay National Monument, at the time of Alaska's statehood, included the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay, we turn to the remaining question: whether the United States "'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain'" its intent to defeat Alaska's title to these submerged lands.  Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). 

1 

 The requisite expression of intent might conceivably reside in the very proclamations that invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create and then expand Glacier Bay National Monument. It is clear, after all, that the Antiquities Act empowers the President to reserve submerged lands.  United States v. California, 436 U.S. 32, 36, 56 L. Ed. 2d 94, 98 S. Ct. 1662 (1978). An essential purpose of monuments created pursuant to the Antiquities Act, furthermore, is "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such  means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." 16 U.S.C. § 1.  From these two premises it would require little additional effort to reach a holding that the Antiquities Act itself delegated to the President sufficient power not only to reserve submerged lands but also to defeat a future State's title to them.  Given the reasons motivating the creation of Glacier Bay National Monument and the overall complexity of the Glacier Bay ecosystem, it would be unsurprising to find that the relevant proclamations manifested intent to retain federal title. 

One amicus has advanced this argument at length, and the United States foreshadows it in a footnote.  See Brief for National Parks Conservation Association as Amicus Curiae 6-7, 13-16; Reply Brief for United States 32, n 20.  If true, this argument would provide a powerful alternative basis for agreeing with the Special Master's recommendation to grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay. 

 We need pursue this alternative basis no further, however.  In our view the provisions of the ASA themselves suffice to  overcome the state ownership presumption arising from the equal footing doctrine and the SLA and to reserve the submerged lands in Glacier Bay to the United States. 

2 

 The Special Master agreed with the United States that Congress expressed an intent to retain title to all of Glacier Bay National Monument, including the submerged lands within it, in § 6(e) of the ASA.  Report 276.  To understand § 6(e), we begin by considering its context within the ASA, its text, and the construction we have given to it in an earlier case. 

Section 5 of the ASA sets forth a guiding principle regarding title to property within Alaska's boundaries: "TheState of Alaska and its political subdivisions, respectively, shall have and retain title to all property, real and personal,  title to which is in the Territory of Alaska or any of the subdivisions.  Except as provided in section 6 hereof, the United States shall retain title to all property, real and personal, to which it has title, including public lands." 72 Stat. 340.

Based on this provision, the new State of Alaska acquired title to any property previously belonging to the Territory of Alaska.  The United States, in turn, retained title to its property located within Alaska's borders, "including public lands," subject to certain exceptions set forth in § 6 of the ASA. 

One of those exceptions is contained in § 6(e), which provides in pertinent part: "All real and personal property of the United States situated in the Territory of Alaska which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska, under the provisions of the Alaska game law of July 1, 1943 (57 Stat. 301; 48 U.S.C., secs. 192-211), as amended, and under  the provisions of the Alaska commercial fisheries laws of June 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 478; 48 U.S.C., secs. 230-239 and 241-242), and June 6, 1924 (43 Stat. 465; 48 U.S.C., secs. 221-228), as supplemented and  amended, shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency: . . . Provided, That such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities utilized in connection therewith, or in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife." Id., at 340-341.

The first quoted part of § 6(e), the initial clause, directs a transfer to Alaska of any federal property located in Alaska and used "for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska" under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  The next quoted part, the proviso, makes clear that the transfer directive in the initial clause has no application to "lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife." 

In Alaska (Arctic Coast), we held that the proviso of § 6(e) expressed congressional intent to retain title to a reservation such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and that the statute's declaration of intent was sufficient to defeat Alaska's presumed title under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA.  "In § 6(e) of the ASA, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'" 521 U.S., at 56-57, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting § 6(e)).  If the proviso of § 6(e) applies to Glacier Bay National Monument, as we held it applied to ANWR in Alaska (Arctic Coast), then it follows that title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay did not pass to Alaska at statehood. 

 To avoid this reasoning, Alaska first argues that the proviso is limited in scope to federal property already covered by the initial clause; because Glacier Bay is not covered by the initial clause, the State contends, it is not covered by the proviso either.  Alaska next argues that even assuming the scope of the proviso is broader than the initial clause,  Glacier Bay was not "set apart" "for the protection of wildlife." We reject both of Alaska's arguments. 

a 

Regarding the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso, Alaska contends the proviso applies only to wildlife refuges or reservations set aside under the three particular federal game and wildlife statutes named in the initial clause.  Glacier Bay National Monument was not set aside under any of these particular statutes, of course; so Alaska says that omission from the initial clause dictates omission from the proviso. The United States counters that the initial clause is confined to specific property but that the proviso is a statement of intent to retain federal title which extends to all reservations thus described without regard to the specific statutory authority under which the reservations were set aside. 

 As the Special Master noted, generalizations about the relationship between a proviso and a preceding clause prove to be of little help in resolving the parties' disagreement about the scope of § 6(e)'s  proviso. Report 268.  Though it may be customary to use a proviso to refer only to things covered by a preceding clause, it is also possible to use a proviso to state a general, independent rule.  "[A] proviso is not always limited in its effect to the part of the enactment with which it is immediately associated; it may apply generally to all cases within the meaning of the language used." McDonald v. United States, 279 U.S. 12, 21, 73 L. Ed. 582, 49 S. Ct. 218 (1929); see also 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:08, p 238 (2000). 

 We conclude that Alaska's narrow reading of the proviso is neither necessary nor preferred.  Section 6(e) begins with specificity.  It covers "all real and personal property" "specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska" as identified under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  Those provisions, in turn, make clear that the initial clause's transfer requirement applies to facilities such as certain fish hatcheries, and likely would include specific types of equipment or even vehicles. 

Having thus transferred the identified "property," the section proceeds to state a more general reservation, using the word "lands." "Provided, [t]hat such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities . . . ." The lands here in question were in fact "withdrawn or otherwise set apart," that is to say by the proclamations which created the monument. Though it may not be the usual style, it does not strike us as illogical for the draftsperson of a statute to write it so that it transfers some specific real and personal property and then proceeds to reserve lands in a much larger classification. 

Alaska's insistence that the proviso must be limited to what is contained at the outset is foreclosed as well by the decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast). In the proceedings leading up to that decision, Alaska had argued that § 6(e)'s proviso did nothing more than to except lands from the transfer effected in § 6(e)'s initial clause.  In Alaska's view, even lands covered by the proviso could still be transferred by virtue of the SLA made applicable to Alaska via § 6(m) of the ASA.  See Reply Brief for State of Alaska in United States v. Alaska, O. T. 1996, No. 84, Orig., pp 44-45. The Court rejected Alaska's view: "If [the Arctic National Wildlife Range is covered by §6(e)'s proviso], then the United States retained title to submerged lands as well as uplands within the Range.  This is so despite § 6(m) of the Statehood Act, which applied the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 to Alaska.  The Submerged Lands Act operated to confirm Alaska's title to equal footing lands and to transfer title to submerged lands beneath the territorial sea to Alaska at statehood, unless the United States clearly withheld submerged lands within either category prior to statehood. In § 6(e) of the Statehood Act, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'" 521 U.S., at 56-57,  138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (emphasis in original).

Thus we have held that § 6(e)'s proviso operates not just negatively and parasitically, only to except refuges or reservations "set apart" for "the protection of wildlife" from the transfer effected by § 6(e)'s main clause, but also affirmatively and independently, as an expression of Congress' intent to retain federal ownership over all lands within such reservations. 

This affirmative and independent expression of intent logically applies with just as much force to reservations that fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause as to those that do not.  It would have made little sense for Congress to differentiate between those two sets of reservations in making the broad statement of intent we have construed § 6(e)'s proviso to set forth.  It would have made even less sense to differentiate in such a way as to exclude reservations set aside pursuant to the Antiquities Act, like Glacier Bay National Monument. The differentiation suggested by Alaska's reading, moreover, cannot be discerned from the text of § 6(e)'s proviso, which covers all reservations set aside "for the protection of wildlife," regardless of the specific authority under which those reservations were set aside. 

 Alaska is correct to note that our decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast) did not directly address the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso in § 6(e).  As Alaska observes, it appears that we assumed the ANWR would fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause were it not for the proviso. Id., at 60-61, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  For the reasons we have explained,  however, the broad construction we gave to the proviso in Alaska (Arctic Coast) of necessity carries consequences for the relationship between it and the initial clause. 

b 

Anticipating the possibility that its narrow interpretation of the proviso might be rejected, Alaska raises one last argument.  The proviso does not reach Glacier Bay even under a broad view of the proviso's scope, Alaska contends, because Glacier Bay was not set apart "for the protection of wildlife" within the meaning of § 6(e). 

This argument can be rejected without extended discussion.  As the Special Master noted and as we have recognized, Congress has made clear that one of the fundamental purposes of wildlife reservations set apart pursuant to the Antiquities Act is "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." 16 U.S.C. § 1.  Because Glacier Bay National Monument serves as habitat for many forms of wildlife, it was set aside in part for its preservation.  Any doubt as to this conclusion is dispelled by reference to the Presidential proclamations setting aside the monument, for the proclamations identify the study of flora and fauna as one of the express purposes of the reservation. 1925 Proclamation, 43 Stat. 1988; 1939 Proclamation, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939).  As the Special Master observed, the study of flora and fauna necessarily requires their preservation.  Report 274. 

 In sum we agree with the United States that the proviso is best read, in light of our prior interpretation of it in Alaska (Arctic Coast), as expressing an independent and general rule uncoupled from the initial clause.  Under the initial clause the United States obligated itself to transfer to Alaska equipment and other property used for general fish and wildlife management responsibilities Alaska was to undertake upon acquiring statehood. Under the proviso the United States expressed its intent, notwithstanding this property transfer, to retain ownership over all federal refuges and reservations set aside for the protection of wildlife, regardless of the specific statutory authority enabling the set-aside.  This expression of intent encompassed Glacier Bay National Monument, which was set aside "for the protection of wildlife" within the meaning of § 6(e).  The text thus defeated the presumption that the new State of Alaska would acquire title to the submerged lands underlying the monument's waters, including the inland waters of Glacier Bay. 

Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint is overruled. 

VI 

 For the foregoing reasons, we overrule each of Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's recommendations.  Alaska shall take title neither to the submerged lands underlying the pockets and enclaves of water at issue in counts I and II of its Amended Complaint nor to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay at issue in count IV.  As to Count III of Alaska's Amended Complaint, the parties and the Special Master are in agreement that this Court should confirm the United States' proposed disclaimer of title.  The proposed disclaimer is hereby accepted. 

The parties are directed to prepare and submit to the Special Master an appropriate proposed decree for the Court's consideration.  The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain  such proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as may become necessary or advisable to effect and supplement the forthcoming decree and the respective rights of the parties. 

It is so ordered. APPENDIX A TO OPINION OF THE COURT

OFFICIAL MAP OF GLACIER BAY NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE 

Published by the National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior. 


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This case involves the process by which Ohio classifies prisoners for placement at its highest security prison, known as a "Supermax" facility.  Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general prison population.  We must consider what process the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires Ohio to afford to inmates before assigning them to Supermax.  We hold that the procedures Ohio has adopted provide sufficient procedural protection to comply with due process requirements. 

I 

The use of Supermax prisons has increased over the last 20 years, in part as a response to the rise in prison gangs and prison violence.  See generally U. S. Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, C. Riveland, Supermax Prisons: Overview and General Considerations 1 (1999), http://www.nicic.org/pubs/1999/014937.pdf (as visited June 29, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).  About 30 States now operate Supermax prisons, in addition to the two operated by the Federal Government.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 2.  In 1998, Ohio opened its only Supermax facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its maximum-security prisons. OSP has the capacity to house up to 504 inmates in single-inmate cells and is designed to "'separate the most predatory and dangerous prisoners from the rest of the . . . general [prison] population.'" See 189 F. Supp. 2d 719, 723 (ND Ohio 2002)(Austin I) (quoting deposition of R. Wilkinson, pp 24-25). 

Conditions at OSP are more restrictive than any other form of incarceration in Ohio, including conditions on its death row or in its administrative control units.  The latter are themselves a highly restrictive form of solitary confinement. See Austin I, supra, 724-725, and n 5 (citing Ohio Admin.  Code § 5120-9-13 (2001) (rescinded 2004)).  In OSP almost every aspect of an inmate's life is controlled and monitored.  Inmates must remain in their cells, which measure 7 by 14 feet, for 23 hours per day.  A light remains on in the cell at all times, though it is sometimes dimmed, and an inmate who attempts to shield the light to sleep is subject to further discipline.  During the one hour per day that an inmate may leave his cell, access is limited to one of two indoor recreation cells. 

Incarceration at OSP is synonymous with extreme isolation.  In contrast to any other Ohio prison, including any segregation unit, OSP cells have solid metal doors with metal strips along their sides and bottoms which prevent conversation or communication with other inmates. All meals are taken alone in the inmate's cell instead of in a common eating area.  Opportunities for visitation are rare and in all events are conducted through glass walls.  It is fair to say OSP inmates are deprived of almost any environmental or sensory stimuli and of almost all human contact. 

Aside from the severity of the conditions,  placement at OSP is for an indefinite period of time, limited only by an  inmate's sentence. For an inmate serving a life sentence, there is no indication how long he may be incarcerated at OSP once assigned there.  Austin I, supra, at 740.  Inmates otherwise eligible for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP.  189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728. 

Placement at OSP is determined in the following manner: Upon entering the prison system, all Ohio inmates are assigned a numerical security classification from level 1 through level 5, with 1 the lowest security risk and 5 the highest.  See Brief for Petitioners 7.  The initial security classification is based on numerous factors (e.g., the nature of the underlying offense, criminal history, or gang affiliation) but is subject to modification at any time during the inmate's prison term if, for instance, he engages in misconduct or is deemed a security risk.  Ibid. Level 5 inmates are placed in OSP, and levels 1 through 4 inmates are placed at lower security facilities throughout the State.  Ibid.

Ohio concedes that when OSP first became operational, the procedures used to assign inmates to the facility were inconsistent and undefined.  For a time, no official policy governing placement was in effect.  See Austin I, supra, at 726-727.  Haphazard placements were not uncommon, and some individuals who did not pose high-security risks were designated, nonetheless, for OSP.  In an effort to establish guidelines for the selection and classification of inmates suitable for OSP, Ohio issued Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Policy 111-07 (Aug. 31, 1998).  This policy has been revised at various points but relevant here are two versions: the "Old Policy" and the "New Policy." The Old Policy took effect on January 28, 1999, but problems with assignment appear to have persisted even under this written set of standards.  189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728-736.  After forming a committee to study the matter and retaining a national expert in prison security, Ohio promulgated the New Policy in early 2002.  The New Policy provided more guidance regarding the factors to be considered in placement decisions and afforded inmates more procedural protection against erroneous placement at OSP. 

 Although the record is not altogether clear regarding the precise manner in which the New Policy operates, we construe it based on the policy's text, the accompanying forms, and the parties' representations at oral argument and in their briefs.  The New Policy appears to operate as follows: A classification review for OSP placement can occur either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e.g., organized crime, or (2) during the term of incarceration if an inmate engages in specified conduct, e.g., leads a prison gang. App. 42-43.  The review process begins when a prison official prepares a "Security Designation Long Form" (Long Form).  Id., at 20.  This three-page form details matters such as the inmate's recent violence, escape attempts, gang affiliation, underlying offense, and other pertinent details.  Id., at 20, 38-45. 

A three-member Classification Committee (Committee) convenes to review the proposed classification and to hold a hearing.  At least 48 hours before the hearing, the inmate is provided with written notice summarizing the conduct or offense triggering  the review.  Id., at 22, 58.  At the time of notice, the inmate also has access to the Long Form, which details why the review was initiated.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-17.  The inmate may attend the hearing, may "offer any pertinent information, explanation and/or objections to [OSP] placement," and may submit a written statement.  App. 22.  He may not call witnesses. 

If the Committee does not recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. Id., at 62, 65.  See also Brief for Petitioners 9.  If the Committee does recommend OSP placement, it documents the decision on a "Classification Committee Report" (CCR), setting forth "the nature of the threat the inmate presents and the committee's reasons for the recommendation," App. 64, as well as a summary of any information  presented at the hearing.  Id., at 59-65.  The Committee sends the completed CCR to the warden of the prison where the inmate is housed or, in the case of an inmate just entering the prison system, to another designated official.  Id., at 23. 

If, after reviewing the CCR, the warden (or the designated official) disagrees and concludes that OSP is inappropriate, the process terminates and the inmate is not placed in OSP.  If the warden agrees, he indicates his approval on the CCR, provides his reasons, and forwards the annotated CCR to the Bureau of Classification (Bureau) for a final decision.  Id., at 64.  (The Bureau is a body of Ohio prison officials vested with final decisionmaking authority over all Ohio inmate assignments.) The annotated CCR is served upon the inmate, notifying him of the Classification Committee's and warden's recommendations and reasons.  Id., at 65.  The inmate has 15 days to file any objections with the Bureau of Classification. Ibid.

After the 15-day period, the Bureau of Classification reviews the CCR and makes a final determination.  If it concludes OSP placement is inappropriate, the process terminates. If the Bureau approves the warden's recommendation, the inmate is transferred to OSP.  The Bureau's chief notes the reasons for the decision on the CCR, and the CCR is again provided to the inmate. Ibid.

Inmates assigned to OSP receive another review within 30 days of their arrival.  That review is conducted by a designated OSP staff member, who examines the inmate's file.  Id., at 25.  If the OSP staff member deems the inmate inappropriately placed, he prepares a written recommendation to the OSP warden that the inmate be transferred to a lower security institution.  Brief for Petitioners 9; App. 25.  If the OSP warden concurs, he forwards that transfer recommendation to the Bureau of Classification for appropriate action.  If the inmate is deemed properly placed, he remains in OSP and his placement is reviewed on at least an annual basis according to the initial three-tier classification review process outlined above.  Brief for Petitioners 9-10. 

 II 

 This action began when a class of current and former OSP inmates brought suit under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against various Ohio prison officials.  We refer to the class of plaintiff inmates, respondents here, collectively as "the inmates."  We refer to the prison officials, petitioners here, as "Ohio." 

The inmates' complaint alleged that Ohio's Old Policy, which was in effect at the time the suit was brought, violated due process.  In addition the inmates brought a claim that certain conditions at OSP violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments, but that claim was settled in the District Court.  The extent to which the settlement resolved the practices that were the subject of the inmates' Eighth Amendment claim is unclear but, in any event, that issue is not before us.  The inmates' suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  On the eve of trial Ohio promulgated its New Policy and represented that it contained the procedures to be followed in the future.  The District Court and Court of Appeals evaluated the adequacy of the New Policy, and it therefore forms the basis for our determination here. 

After an 8-day trial with extensive evidence, including testimony from expert witnesses, the District Court made findings and conclusions and issued a detailed remedial order.  First, relying on this Court's decision in Sandin v. Conner,515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the District Court found that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.  Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 738-740.  Second, the District Court found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford a large number of them notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give inmates sufficient notice of the grounds serving as the basis for their retention at OSP; and failing to give the inmates sufficient opportunity to understand the reasoning and evidence  used to retain them at OSP.  Id., at 749.  Third, the District Court held that, although Ohio's New Policy provided more procedural safeguards than its Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedural due process requirements.  Id., at 736, 750-754.  In a separate order it directed extensive modifications to that policy.  204 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (ND Ohio 2002). 

The modifications the District Court ordered to Ohio's New Policy included both substantive and procedural reforms.  The former narrowed the grounds that Ohio could consider in recommending assignment to OSP.  For instance, possession of drugs in small amounts, according to the District Court, could not serve as the basis for an OSP assignment.  Id., at 1028.  The following are some of the procedural modifications the District Court ordered: 

(1) Finding that the notice provisions of Ohio's New Policy were inadequate, the District Court ordered Ohio to provide the inmates with an exhaustive list of grounds believed to justify placement at OSP and a summary of all evidence upon which the Classification Committee would rely.  Matters not so identified, the District Court ordered, could not be considered by the Committee.  Id., at 1026. 

(2) The District Court supplemented the inmate's opportunity to appear before the Committee and to make an oral or written statement by ordering Ohio to allow inmates to present documentary evidence and call witnesses before the Committee, provided that doing so would not be unduly hazardous or burdensome.  The District Court further ordered that Ohio must attempt to secure the  participation of any witness housed within the prison system. Id., at 1026-1027. 

(3) Finding the New Policy's provision of a brief statement of reasons for a recommendation of OSP placement inadequate, the District Court ordered the Classification Committee to summarize all evidence supporting its recommendation. Id., at 1027.  Likewise, the District Court ordered the Bureau of Classification to prepare a "detailed and specific" statement "set[ting] out all grounds" justifying OSP placement including "facts relied upon and reasoning used." Id., at 1027.  The statement shall "not use conclusory," "vague," or "boilerplate language," and must be delivered to the inmate within five days.  Id., at 1027-1028. 

(4) The District Court supplemented the New Policy's 30-day and annual review processes, ordering Ohio to notify the inmate twice per year both in writing and orally of his progress toward a security level reduction.  Specifically, that notice must "advise the inmate what specific conduct is necessary for that prisoner to be reduced from Level 5 and the amount of time it will take before [Ohio] reduces the inmate's security level classification." Ibid.

Ohio appealed.  First, it maintained that the inmates lacked a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding placement at OSP.  Second, it argued that, even assuming a liberty interest, its New Policy provides constitutionally adequate procedures and thus the District Court's modifications were unnecessary.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's conclusion that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding placement at OSP.  372 F.3d 346, 356 (2004).  The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court's procedural modifications in their entirety.  Id., at 359-360.  Finally, it set aside the District Court's far-reaching substantive modifications, concluding they exceeded the scope of the District Court's authority.  This last aspect of the Court of Appeals' ruling is not the subject of review in this Court. 

 We granted certiorari to consider what process an inmate must be afforded under the Due Process Clause when he is considered for placement at OSP.   543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct. 686 (2004).  For reasons discussed below, we conclude that the inmates have a protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  We further hold that the procedures set forth in the New Policy are sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's requirements; it follows, then, that the procedural modifications  ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals were in error. 

III 

Withdrawing from the position taken in the Court of Appeals, Ohio in its briefs to this Court conceded that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  See Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Petitioners i.  The United States, supporting Ohio as amicus curiae, disagrees with Ohio's concession and argues that the inmates have no liberty interest in avoiding assignment to a prison facility with more restrictive conditions of confinement. See Brief for United States 10.  At oral argument Ohio initially adhered to its earlier concession, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, but when pressed, the State backtracked.  See id., at 6-7.  We need  reach the question of what process is due only if the inmates establish a constitutionally protected liberty interest, so it is appropriate to address this threshold question at the outset. 

 The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects persons against deprivations of life, liberty, or property; and those who seek to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.  A liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the word "liberty," see, e.g., Vitek v. Jones,445 U.S. 480, 493-494, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552, 100 S. Ct. 1254 (1980) (liberty interest in avoiding involuntary psychiatric treatment and transfer to mental institution), or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies, see, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell,418 U.S. 539, 556-558, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974) (liberty interest in avoiding withdrawal of state-created system of good-time credits). 

We have held that the Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement. Meachum v. Fano,427 U.S. 215, 225, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, 96 S. Ct. 2532 (1976) (no liberty interest arising from Due Process Clause itself in transfer from low- to maximum-security  prison because "[c]onfinement in any of the State's institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose").  We have also held, however, that a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin v. Conner,515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995). 

Sandin involved prisoners' claims to procedural due process protection before placement in segregated confinement for 30 days, imposed as discipline for disruptive behavior. Sandin observed that some of our earlier cases, Hewitt v. Helms,459 U.S. 460, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 864 (1983), in particular, had employed a methodology for identifying state-created liberty interests that emphasized "the language of a particular [prison] regulation" instead of "the nature of the deprivation." Sandin, 515 U.S., at 481, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  In Sandin, we criticized this methodology as creating a disincentive for States to promulgate procedures for prison management, and as involving the federal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons. Id., at 482-483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  For these reasons, we abrogated the methodology of parsing the language of particular regulations. "[T]he search for a negative implication from mandatory language in prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The time has come to return to the due process principles we believe were correctly established in and applied in Wolff and Meachum. Following Wolff, we recognize that States may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.  But these interests will generally be limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process  Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation  to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Id., at 483-484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (citations and footnote omitted).

After Sandin, it is clear that the touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in avoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those conditions but the nature of those conditions themselves "in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293. 

Applying this refined inquiry, Sandin found no liberty interest protecting against a 30-day assignment to segregated confinement because it did not "present a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of [the inmate's] sentence." Id., at 485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  We noted, for example, that inmates in the general population experienced "significant amounts of 'lockdown time'" and that the degree of confinement in disciplinary segregation was not excessive.  Id., at 486, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 .  We did not find, moreover, the short duration of segregation to work a major disruption in the inmate's environment.  Ibid.

 The Sandin standard requires us to determine if assignment to OSP "imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life." Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  In Sandin's wake the Courts of Appeals have not reached consistent conclusions for identifying the baseline from which to measure what is atypical and significant in any particular prison system. Compare e.g., Beverati v. Smith, 120 F.3d 500, 504 (CA4 1997), and Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089 (CA9 1996), with Hatch v. District of Columbia, 337 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 184 F.3d 846, 847 (CADC 1999).  See also Wagner v. Hanks, 128 F.3d 1173, 1177 (CA7 1997).  This divergence indicates the difficulty of locating the appropriate baseline, an issue that was not explored at length in the briefs.  We need not resolve the issue here, however, for we are satisfied that assignment to OSP imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible baseline. 

For an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not permitted  from cell to cell; the light, though it may be dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per day, but only in a small indoor room.  Save perhaps for the especially severe limitations on all human contact, these conditions likely would apply to most solitary confinement facilities, but here there are two added components.  First is the duration.  Unlike the 30-day placement inSandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and, after an initial 30-day review,  is reviewed just annually.  Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole consideration. Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728.  While any of these conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to create a liberty interest, taken together they impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context.  It follows that respondents have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.  Sandin, supra, at 483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293. 

 OSP's harsh conditions may well be necessary and appropriate in light of the danger that high-risk inmates pose both to prison officials and to other prisoners.  See infra, 545 U.S. 209, 227, 125 S. Ct. 2384, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 192-193.  That necessity, however, does not diminish our conclusion that the conditions give rise to a liberty interest in their avoidance. 

IV 

 A liberty interest having been established, we turn to the question of what process is due an inmate whom Ohio seeks to place in OSP.  Because the requirements of due process are "flexible and cal[l] for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands," Morrissey v. Brewer,408 U.S. 471, 481, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484, 92 S. Ct. 2593 (1972), we generally have declined to establish rigid rules and instead have embraced a framework to evaluate the sufficiency of particular procedures.  The framework, established in Mathews v. Eldridge,424 U.S. 319, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976), requires consideration of three distinct factors: "First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation  of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail." Id., at 335, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 S. Ct. 893.

The Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's procedural modifications under the assumption that Sandin altered the first Mathews factor.  It reasoned that, "[i]n this first factor, Sandin affects the due process balance: because only those conditions that constitute 'atypical and significant hardships' give rise to liberty interests, those interests will necessarily be of a weight requiring greater due process protection." 372 F.3d at 358-359.  This proposition does not follow from Sandin.  Sandin concerned only whether a state-created liberty interest existed so as to trigger Mathews balancing at all.  Having found no liberty interest to be at stake,Sandin had no occasion to consider whether the private interest was weighty vis-a-vis the remaining Mathews factors. 

 Applying the three factors set forth inMathews, we find Ohio's New Policy provides a sufficient level of process.  We first consider the significance of the inmate's interest in avoiding erroneous placement at OSP.  Prisoners held in lawful confinement have their liberty curtailed by definition, so the procedural protections to which they are entitled are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from confinement at all.  See, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54, 95 S. Ct. 854 (1975); Wolff,418 U.S. 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963.  The private interest at stake here, while more than minimal, must be evaluated, nonetheless, within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties. 

 The second factor addresses the risk of an erroneous placement under the procedures in place, and the probable value, if any, of additional or alternative procedural safeguards.  The New Policy provides that an inmate must receive notice  of the factual basis leading to consideration for OSP placement and a fair opportunity for rebuttal.  Our procedural due process cases have consistently observed that these are among the most important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.  See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex,442 U.S. 1, 15, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100 (1979); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill,470 U.S. 532, 543, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (1985); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, 92 S. Ct. 1983 (1972) ("For more than a centurythe central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: 'Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified'" (quoting Baldwin v. Hale, 68 U.S. 223, 1 Wall. 223, 233, 17 L. Ed. 531 (1864))).  Requiring officials to provide a brief summary of the factual basis for the classification review and allowing the inmate a rebuttal opportunity safeguards against the inmate's being mistaken for another or singled out for insufficient reason.  In addition to having the opportunity to be heard at the Classification Committee stage, Ohio also invites the inmate to submit objections prior to the final level of review.  This second opportunity further reduces the possibility of an erroneous deprivation. 

Although a subsequent reviewer may overturn an affirmative recommendation for OSP placement, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. This avoids one of problems apparently present under the Old Policy, where, even if two levels of reviewers recommended against placement, a later reviewer could overturn their recommendation without explanation. 

If the recommendation is OSP placement, Ohio requires that the decisionmaker provide a short statement of reasons.  This requirement guards against arbitrary decisionmaking while also providing the inmate a basis for objection before the next decisionmaker or in a subsequent classification review.  The statement also serves as a guide for future behavior.  See Greenholtz, supra, at 16, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100. 

 As we have noted, Ohio provides multiple levels of review for any decision recommending OSP placement, with power to overturn the recommendation at each level.  In addition to these safeguards, Ohio further reduces the risk of erroneous placement by providing for a placement review within 30 days of an inmate's initial assignment to OSP. 

 The thirdMathews factor addresses the State's interest.  In the context of prison management, and in the specific circumstances of this case, this interest is a dominant consideration.  Ohio has responsibility for imprisoning nearly 44,000 inmates. Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 727.  The State's first obligation must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the public, and the prisoners themselves.  See Hewitt, 459 U.S., at 473, 74 L. Ed. 675, 103 S. Ct. 864.

Prison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison gangs, provides the backdrop of the State's interest.  Clandestine, organized, fueled by race-based hostility, and  committed to fear and violence as a means of disciplining their own members and their rivals, gangs seek nothing less than to control prison life and to extend their power outside prison walls.  See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 6.  Murder of an inmate, a guard, or one of their family members on the outside is a common form of gang discipline and control, as well as a condition for membership in some gangs. See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 888 (CA9 1995); United States v. Silverstein, 732 F.2d 1338, 1341 (CA7 1984).  Testifying against, or otherwise informing on, gang activities can invite one's own death sentence. It is worth noting in this regard that for prison gang members serving life sentences, some without the possibility of parole, the deterrent effects of ordinary criminal punishment may be substantially diminished.  See id., at 1343 ("[T]o many inmates of Marion's Control Unit [a federal Supermax facility,  ] the price of murder must not be high and to some it must be close to zero"). 

 The problem of scarce resources is another component of the State's interest.  The cost of keeping a single prisoner in one of Ohio's ordinary maximum-security prisons is $34,167 per year, and the cost to maintain each inmate at OSP is $49,007 per year.  See Austin I, supra, at 734, n. 17.  We can assume that Ohio, or any other penal system, faced with costs like these will find it difficult to fund more effective education and vocational assistance programs to improve the lives of the prisoners. It follows that courts must give substantial deference to prison management decisions before mandating additional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards when correctional officials conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behavior. 

 The State's interest must be understood against this background.  Were Ohio to allow an inmate to call witnesses or provide other attributes of an adversary hearing before ordering transfer to OSP, both the State's immediate objective of controlling the prisoner and its greater objective of controlling the prison could be defeated.  This problem,  moreover, is not alleviated by providing an exemption for witnesses who pose a hazard, for nothing in the record indicates simple mechanisms exist to determine when witnesses may be called without fear of reprisal.  The danger to witnesses, and the difficulty in obtaining their cooperation, make the probable value of an adversary-type hearing doubtful in comparison to its obvious costs. 

 A balance of theMathews factors yields the conclusion that Ohio's New Policy is adequate to safeguard an inmate's liberty interest in not being assigned to OSP.  Ohio is not, for example, attempting to remove an inmate from free society for a specific parole violation, see, e.g., Morrissey,408 U.S., at 481, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484, 92 S. Ct. 2593, or to revoke good time credits for specific, serious misbehavior, see, e.g., Wolff, 418 U.S., at 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963, where more formal, adversary-type procedures might be useful.  Where the inquiry draws more on the experience of prison administrators, and where the State's interest implicates the  safety of other inmates and prison personnel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenholtz, 442 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100, and Hewitt v. Helms,supra, provide the appropriate model.  Greenholtz, supra, at 16, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100 (level of process due for inmates being considered for release on parole includes opportunity to be heard and notice of any adverse decision); Hewitt, supra, at 473-476, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 864 (level of process due for inmates being considered for transfer to administrative segregation includes some notice of charges and an opportunity to be heard).  Although Sandin abrogated Greenholtz's and Hewitt's methodology for establishing the liberty interest, these cases remain instructive for their discussion of the appropriate level of procedural safeguards. Ohio's New Policy provides informal, nonadversary procedures comparable to those we upheld in Greenholtz and Hewitt, and no further procedural modifications are necessary in order to satisfy due process under the Mathews test.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals should have ordered the New Policy altered. 

The effect of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, in particular 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), in this case has not been discussed at any length in the briefs.  In view of our disposition it is unnecessary to address its application here. 

Prolonged confinement in Supermax may be the State's only option for the control of some inmates, and claims alleging violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments were resolved, or withdrawn, by settlement in an early phase of this case.  Here, any claim of excessive punishment in individual circumstances is not before us. 

The complaint challenged OSP assignments under the Old Policy, and the unwritten policies that preceded it, and alleged injuries resulting from those systems. Ohio conceded that assignments made under the Old Policy were, to say the least, imprecise.  The District Court found constitutional violations had arisen under those earlier versions, and held  that the New Policy would produce many of the same constitutional problems.  Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 749-754.  We now hold that the New Policy as described in this opinion strikes a constitutionally permissible balance between the factors of the Mathews framework.  If an inmate were to demonstrate that the New Policy did not in practice operate in this fashion, resulting in a cognizable injury, that could be the subject of an appropriate future challenge.  On remand, the Court of Appeals, or the District Court, may consider in the first instance what, if any, prospective relief is still a necessary and appropriate remedy for due process violations under Ohio's previous policies.  Any such relief must, of course, satisfy the conditions set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). * * * 

 The Court of Appeals was correct to find the inmates possess a liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  The Court of Appeals was incorrect, however, to sustain the procedural modifications ordered by the District Court.  The portion of the Court of Appeals' opinion reversing the District Court's substantive modifications was not the subject of review upon certiorari and is unaltered by our decision. 

 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This is a Bivens action against criminal investigators for inducing prosecution in retaliation for speech.  The question is whether the complaint states an actionable violation of the First Amendment without alleging an absence of probable cause to support the underlying criminal charge. We hold that want of probable cause must be alleged and proven. 

I 

In the 1980's, respondent William G. Moore, Jr., was the chief executive of Recognition Equipment Inc. (REI), which manufactured a multiline optical character reader for interpreting multiple lines of text.  Although REI had received some $50 million from the United States Postal Service to develop this technology for reading and sorting mail, the Postmaster General and other top officials of the Postal Service were urging mailers to use nine-digit zip  codes (Zip + 4), which would provide enough routing information on one line of text to allow single-line scanning machines to sort mail automatically by reading just that line. 

Besides Moore, who obviously stood to gain financially from the adoption of multiline technology, some Members of Congress and Government research officers had reservations about the Postal Service's Zip + 4 policy and its intended reliance on single-line readers.  Critics maligned single-line scanning technology, objected to the foreign sources of single-line scanners, decried the burden of remembering the four extra numbers, 1See, e.g., Seaberry, Durenberger Begins Campaign Against Nine-Digit Zip Code, Washington Post, Feb. 24, 1981, p E4 (describing Senator David Durenberger's reference to the Zip + 4 campaign as "'a mnemonic plague of contagious digititous'"). and echoed the conclusion reached by the United States Office of Technology Assessment, that use of the single-line scanners in preference to multiliners would cost the Postal Service $1 million a day in operational losses. 

Moore built on this opposition to Zip + 4, by lobbying Members of Congress, testifying before congressional committees, and supporting a "Buy American" rider to the Postal Service's 1985 appropriations bill.  Notwithstanding alleged requests by the Postmaster General to be quiet, REI followed its agenda by hiring a public-relations firm, Gnau and Associates, Inc. (GAI), which one of the Postal Service's governors, Peter Voss, had recommended. 

The campaign succeeded, and in July 1985 the Postal Service made what it called a "mid-course correction" and embraced multiline technology. Brief for Respondent 4.  But the change of heart did not extend to Moore and REI, for the Service's ensuing order of multiline equipment,  valued somewhere between $250 million and $400 million, went to a competing firm. 

Not only did REI lose out on the contract, but Moore and REI were soon entangled in two investigations by Postal Service inspectors. The first looked into the purported payment of kickbacks by GAI to Governor Voss for Voss's recommendations of GAI's services, as in the case of REI; the second sought to document REI's possibly improper role in the search for a new Postmaster General.  Notwithstanding very limited evidence linking Moore and REI to any wrongdoing,  an Assistant United States Attorney decided to bring criminal charges against them, and in 1988 the grand jury indicted Moore, REI, and REI's vice president.  At the close of the Government's case, after six weeks of trial, however, the District Court concluded that there was a "complete lack of direct evidence" connecting the defendants to any of the criminal wrongdoing alleged, and it granted the REI defendants' motion for judgment of acquittal.  United States v. Recognition Equip. Inc., 725 F. Supp. 587, 596 (DC 1989). 

Moore then brought an action in the Northern District of Texas for civil liability under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971), 2"Bivens established that the victims of a constitutional violation by a federal agent have a right to recover damages against the official in federal court despite the absence of any statute conferring such a right." Carlson v. Green,446 U.S. 14, 18, 100 S. Ct. 1468, 64 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1980).  Though more limited in some respects not relevant here, a Bivens action is the federal analog to suits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Wilson v. Layne,526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 143 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1999); see also Waxman & Morrison, What Kind of Immunity?  Federal Officers, State Criminal Law, and the Supremacy Clause, 112 Yale L. J. 2195, 2208 (2003) ("Section 1983 applies . . . to state and local officers, [and] the Supreme Court in Bivens . . . inferred a parallel damages action against federal officers"). against the prosecutor and the five postal inspectors who are petitioners here (a sixth  having died).  His complaint raised five causes of action, only one of which is relevant here, the claim that the prosecutor and the inspectors had engineered his criminal prosecution in retaliation for criticism of the Postal Service, thus violating the First Amendment.  In the course of these proceedings Moore has argued, among other things, that the postal inspectors launched a criminal investigation against him well before they had any inkling of either of the two schemes mentioned above, that the inspectors targeted him for his lobbying activities, and that they pressured the United States Attorney's Office to have him indicted.  Moore also sought recovery from the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  The District Court dismissed the claims against the Assistant United States Attorney in accordance with the absolute immunity for prosecutorial judgment, and rejected an abuse-of-process claim against the inspectors. Moore v. Valder, Civil Action No. 3:91-CV-2491-G (ND Tex., Sept. 21, 1992).3Moore and his wife had originally filed this complaint jointly.  Her claims were dismissed for lack of standing.

The claims remaining were transferred to the District Court for the District of Columbia, where Moore's suit was dismissed in its entirety 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13943, Civ. Nos. 92-2288 (NHJ), 93-0324 (NHJ), 1993 WL 405785 (Sept. 24, 1993), only to have the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reinstate the retaliatory-prosecution claim.  Moore v. Valder, 314 U.S. App. D.C. 209, 65 F.3d 189 (1995).  The District Court then permitted limited discovery on that matter so far as the inspectors were involved, but again dismissed the remaining charges against the United States and the prosecutor. Moore v. Valder, Civil Action No. 92-2288 (NHJ) et al., Record, Tab No. 32 (Memorandum Opinion, Feb. 5, 1998).  Although Moore succeeded in having the District of Columbia Circuit reinstate his FTCA claim against the United States, the dismissal of his claims against the prosecutor was affirmed.  Moore v. United States, 341 U.S. App. D.C. 348, 213 F.3d 705 (2000). 

With the remainder of the case back in District Court, the inspectors moved for summary judgment, urging that because the underlying criminal charges were supported by probable cause they were entitled to qualified immunity from a retaliatory-prosecution suit.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 363 U.S. App. D.C. 350, 388 F.3d 871 (2004). 

The Courts of Appeals have divided on the issue of requiring evidence of a lack of probable cause in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Bivens retaliatory-prosecution suits.  Some Circuits burden plaintiffs with the obligation to show its absence.  See, e.g., Wood v. Kesler, 323 F.3d 872, 883 (CA11 2003); Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d 252, 260 (CA5 2002); Mozzochi  v. Borden, 959 F.2d 1174, 1179-1180 (CA2 1992).  Others, including the District of Columbia Circuit, impose no such requirement.  See, e.g., Poole v. County of Otero, 271 F.3d 955, 961 (CA10 2001); Haynesworth v. Miller, 261 U.S. App. D.C. 66, 820 F.2d 1245, 1256-1257 (CADC 1987). We granted certiorari, 545 U.S. 1138, 125 S. Ct. 2977, 162 L. Ed. 2d 886 (2005), to resolve the Circuit split and now reverse.

 Official reprisal for protected speech "offends the Constitution [because] it threatens to inhibit exercise of the protected right," Crawford-El v. Britton,523 U.S. 574, 588, n. 10, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998), and the law is settled that as a general matter the First Amendment prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions, including criminal prosecutions, for speaking out, id., at 592, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759; see also Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972) (noting that the government may not punish a person or deprive him of a benefit on the basis of his "constitutionally protected speech").  Some official actions adverse to such a speaker might well be unexceptionable if taken on other grounds, but when nonretaliatory grounds are in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, we have held that retaliation is subject to recovery as the but-for cause of official action offending the Constitution.  See Crawford-El, supra, at 593, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759; Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,429 U.S. 274, 283-284, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977) (adverse action against government employee cannot be taken if it is in response to the employee's "exercise of constitutionally protected First Amendment freedoms").  When the vengeful officer is federal, he is subject to an action for damages on the authority of Bivens. See 403 U.S., at 397, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619. 

III 

 Despite a procedural history portending another Jarndyce v. Jarndyce, 4See 2 C. Dickens, Bleak House 85 (1853). the issue before us is straightforward: whether  a plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution action must plead and show the absence of probable cause for pressing the underlying criminal charges. 5 Moore contends that we (like the Court of Appeals before us) exceed our appellate jurisdiction when we address the issue of probable cause, see Brief for Respondent 37-39, but his argument is mistaken.  It is true that the disagreement over a no-probable-cause requirement arose on the inspectors' motion for summary judgment on their qualified-immunity defense; Moore stresses that an interlocutory appeal can be taken from the rejection of qualified immunity at the summary-judgment stage only on questions turning on the definition of the violation, not on the sufficiency of the evidence to show that a defendant is in fact entitled to the immunity claimed. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985). Moore says that the issue of probable cause or its absence is simply an evidentiary matter going to entitlement in fact.  But the inspectors are making more than a claim about the evidence in this case: they are arguing that we should hold that a showing of no probable cause is an element of the kind of claim Moore is making against them.  In agreeing with the inspectors, we are addressing a requirement of causation, which Moore must plead and prove in order to win, and our holding does not go beyond a definition of an element of the tort, directly implicated by the defense of qualified immunity and properly before us on interlocutory appeal.  See ibid.; see also Crawford-El v. Britton,523 U.S. 574, 588, 592-593, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle,429 U.S. 274, 285-286, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1977).

 A 

 The inspectors argue on two fronts that absence of probable cause should be an essential element.  Without such a requirement, they first say, the Bivens claim is too readily available.  A plaintiff can afflict a public officer with disruption and expense by alleging nothing more, in practical terms, than action with a retaliatory animus, a subjective condition too easy to claim and too hard to defend against.  Brief for Petitioners 21-23; see also National Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish,541 U.S. 157, 175, 124 S. Ct. 1570, 158 L. Ed. 2d 319 (2004) (allegations of government misconduct are "'easy to allege and hard to disprove'").  In the inspectors' view, some "objective" burden must be imposed on these plaintiffs, simply to filter out the frivolous.  The second argument complements the  first, for the inspectors believe that the traditional tort of malicious prosecution tells us what the objective requirement should be.  Brief for Petitioners 24-29.  In an action for malicious prosecution after an acquittal, a plaintiff must show that the criminal action was begun without probable cause for charging the crime in the first place; the inspectors see retaliatory prosecution under Bivens as a close cousin of malicious prosecution under common law, making the latter's no-probable-cause requirement a natural feature of the constitutional tort.  See Heck v. Humphrey,512 U.S. 477, 483-485, and 484, n 4, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994).

B 

 In fact, we think there is a fair argument for what the inspectors call an "objective" fact requirement in this type of case, but the nub of that argument differs from the two they set out, which we will deal with only briefly.  As for the invitation to rely on common-law parallels, we certainly are ready to look at the elements of common-law torts when we think about elements of actions for constitutional violations, see Carey v. Piphus,435 U.S. 247, 258, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1978), but the common law is best understood here more as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components of Bivens torts.  See, e.g., Albright v. Oliver,510 U.S. 266, 277, n. 1, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994) (Ginsburg, J., concurring); Bivens, supra, at 394, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619; cf. Baker v. McCollan,443 U.S. 137, 146, 99 S. Ct. 2689, 61 L. Ed. 2d 433 (1979).  And in this instance we could debate whether the closer common-law analog to retaliatory prosecution is malicious prosecution (with its no-probable-cause element) or abuse of process (without it).  Compare  Heck, 512 U.S., at 48-485, and 484, n. 4, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 with id., at 493-496, 114 S. Ct. 2364, 129 L. Ed. 2d 383 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment). 

Nor is there much leverage in the fear that without a filter to screen out claims federal prosecutors and federal courts will be unduly put upon by the volume of litigation.  The basic concern is fair enough, but the slate is not blank.  Over the past 25 years fewer than two dozen damages  actions for  retaliatory prosecution under Bivens or § 1983 have come squarely before the Federal Courts of Appeals, and there is no disproportion of those cases in Circuits that do not require showing an absence of probable cause. 6In fact, many of the appellate challenges have been brought in the Second, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits, all of which require plaintiffs to show an absence of probable cause. See, e.g., Izen v. Catalina, 398 F.3d 363 (CA5 2005)(per curiam); Wood v. Kesler, 323 F.3d 872 (CA11 2003); Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d 252 (CA5 2002); Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.3d 110 (CA2 1995); Post v. Fort Lauderdale, 7 F.3d 1552 (CA11 1993); Mozzochi v. Borden, 959 F.2d 1174 (CA2 1992); Magnotti v. Kuntz, 918 F.2d 364 (CA2 1990).

 C 

 It is, instead, the need to prove a chain of causation from animus to injury, with details specific to retaliatory-prosecution cases, that provides the strongest justification for the no-probable-cause requirement espoused by the inspectors. Although a Bivens (or § 1983) plaintiff must show a causal connection between a defendant's retaliatory animus and subsequent injury in any sort of retaliation action, see Crawford-El, 523 U.S., at 593, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759; Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S., at 285-287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471, the need to demonstrate causation in the retaliatory-prosecution context presents an additional difficulty that can be understood by comparing the requisite causation in ordinary retaliation claims, where the government agent allegedly harboring the animus is also the individual allegedly taking the adverse action, with causation in a case like this one. 

 Take the example of a public employee's claim that he was fired for speech criticizing the government.  See, e.g., Pickering v. Board of Educ.,391 U.S. 563, 566-567, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968) (allegation that a school board dismissed a teacher for writing a public letter critical of the board's financial administration).  While the employee plaintiff obviously must plead and prove adverse  official action in retaliation for making the statements, our discussions of the elements of the constitutional tort do not specify any necessary details about proof of a connection between the retaliatory animus and the discharge, which will depend on the circumstances.  Cf. Crawford-El, supra, at 593, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 ("[A]t least with certain types of claims, proof of an improper motive is not sufficient to establish a constitutional violation--there must also be evidence of causation").  The cases have simply taken the evidence of the motive and the discharge as sufficient for a circumstantial demonstration that the one caused the other.  See, e.g., Mt. Healthy, supra, at 287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471; see also Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,429 U.S. 252, 270, n. 21, 97 S. Ct. 555, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977).  It is clear, moreover, that the causation is understood to be but-for causation, without which the adverse action  would not have been taken; we say that upon a prima facie showing of retaliatory harm, the burden shifts to the defendant official to demonstrate that even without the impetus to retaliate he would have taken the action complained of (such as firing the employee).  See Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S., at 287, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471.  If there is a finding that  retaliation was not the but-for cause of the discharge, the claim fails for lack of causal connection between unconstitutional motive and resulting harm, despite proof of some retaliatory animus in the official's mind.  See ibid. It may be dishonorable to act with an unconstitutional motive and perhaps in some instances be unlawful, but action colored by some degree of bad motive does not amount to a constitutional tort if that action would have been taken anyway.  See Crawford-El, supra, at 593, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759; Mt. Healthy, supra, at 285-286, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471. 

 When the claimed retaliation for protected conduct is a criminal charge, however, a constitutional tort action will differ from this standard case in two ways.  Like any other plaintiff charging official retaliatory action, the plaintiff in a retaliatory-prosecution claim must prove the elements of retaliatory animus as the cause of injury, and the defendant  will have the same opportunity to respond to a prima facie case by showing that the action would have been taken anyway, independently of any retaliatory animus. What is different about a prosecution case, however, is that there will always be a distinct body of highly valuable circumstantial evidence available and apt to prove or disprove retaliatory causation, namely evidence showing whether there was or was not probable cause to bring the criminal charge. Demonstrating that there was no probable cause for the underlying criminal charge will tend to reinforce the retaliation evidence and show that retaliation was the but-for basis for instigating the prosecution, while establishing the existence of probable cause will suggest that prosecution would have occurred even without a retaliatory motive. This alone does not mean, of course, that a Bivens or § 1983 plaintiff should be required to plead and prove no probable cause, but it does mean that litigating probable cause will be highly likely in any retaliatory-prosecution case, owing to its powerful evidentiary significance. 7Indeed, even though the Court of Appeals in this case held that plaintiffs do not have to show an absence of probable cause in order to make retaliatory-prosecution claims, it nevertheless acknowledged probable cause's significance in such suits.  See 363 U.S. App. D.C. 350, 388 F.3d 871, 881 (CADC 2004) ("Given that probable cause ordinarily suffices to initiate a prosecution, that showing will be enough in most cases to establish that prosecution would have occurred absent bad intent.  A Bivens recovery remains possible, however, in those rare cases where strong motive evidence combines with weak probable cause to support a finding that the prosecution would not have occurred but for the officials' retaliatory animus").

 The second respect in which a retaliatory-prosecution case is different also goes to the causation that a Bivens plaintiff must prove; the difference is that the requisite causation between the defendant's retaliatory animus and the plaintiff's injury is usually more complex than it is in other retaliation cases, and the need to show this more complex connection supports a requirement that no probable cause be alleged and proven.  A Bivens (or § 1983) action for retaliatory  prosecution will not be brought against the prosecutor, who is absolutely immune from liability for the decision to prosecute, Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S. Ct. 984, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1976). 8 An action could still be brought against a prosecutor for conduct taken in an investigatory capacity, to which absolute immunity does not extend.  See Buckley v. Fitzsimmons,509 U.S. 259, 274-276, 113 S. Ct. 2606, 125 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1993) (no absolute immunity when prosecutor acts in administrative capacity); Burns v. Reed,500 U.S. 478, 492-495, 111 S. Ct. 1934, 114 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1991) (absolute immunity does not attach when a prosecutor offers legal advice to the police regarding interrogation practices).  In fact, Moore's complaint charged the prosecutor with acting in an investigative as well as in a prosecutorial capacity, see App. 45, but dismissal of the complaint as against the prosecutor was affirmed in 341 U.S. App. D.C. 348, 213 F.3d 705, 710 (CADC 2000), and no claim against him is before us now. Instead, the defendant will be a nonprosecutor, an official, like an inspector here, who may have influenced the prosecutorial decision but did not himself make it, and the cause of action will not be strictly for retaliatory prosecution, but for successful retaliatory inducement to prosecute.9No one here claims that simply conducting a retaliatory investigation with a view to promote a prosecution is a constitutional tort.  That is not part of Moore's complaint.  See App. 33-34, 38-45.  Whether the expense or other adverse consequences of a retaliatory investigation would ever justify recognizing such an investigation as a distinct constitutional violation is not before us. The consequence is that a plaintiff like Moore must show that the nonprosecuting official acted in retaliation, and must also show that he induced the prosecutor to bring charges that would not have been initiated without his urging. 

Thus, the causal connection required here is not merely between the retaliatory animus of one person and that person's own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus of one person and the action of another.  See 213 F.3d at 710("In order to find that a defendant procured a prosecution, the plaintiff must establish 'a chain of causation' linking the defendant's actions with the initiation of criminal proceedings"); see also Barts v. Joyner, 865 F.2d 1187, 1195 (CA11 1989) (plaintiff seeking damages incident to her criminal prosecution would have to show that the police, who allegedly  acted in violation of law in securing her arrest, unduly pressured or deceived prosecutors); Dellums v. Powell, 184 U.S. App. D.C. 275, 566 F.2d 167, 192-193 (CADC 1977) (where allegation of misconduct is directed at police, a malicious-prosecution claim cannot stand if the decision made by the prosecutor to bring criminal charges was independent of any pressure exerted by police); cf. Smiddy v. Varney, 665 F.2d 261, 267 (CA9 1981) ("[W]here police officers do not act maliciously or with reckless disregard for the rights of an arrested person,  they are not liable for damages suffered by the arrested person after a district attorney files charges unless the presumption of independent judgment by the district attorney is rebutted"). 

 Herein lies the distinct problem of causation in cases like this one.  Evidence of an inspector's animus does not necessarily show that the inspector induced the action of a prosecutor who would not have pressed charges otherwise.  Moreover, to the factual difficulty of divining the influence of an investigator or other law enforcement officer upon the prosecutor's mind, there is an added legal obstacle in the long-standing presumption of regularity accorded to prosecutorial decision-making.  See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., 525 U.S. 471, 489-490, 119 S. Ct. 936, 142 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1999); United States v. Armstrong,517 U.S. 456, 464-466, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996).  And this presumption that a prosecutor has legitimate grounds for the action he takes is one we do not lightly discard, given our position that judicial intrusion into executive discretion of such high order should be minimal, see Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 607-608, 105 S. Ct. 1524, 84 L. Ed. 2d 547 (1985). 

 Some sort of allegation,  then, is needed both to bridge the gap between the nonprosecuting government agent's motive and the prosecutor's action, and to address the presumption of prosecutorial regularity.  And at the trial stage, some evidence must link the allegedly retaliatory official to a prosecutor whose action has injured the plaintiff.  The connection, to be alleged and shown, is the absence of probable cause. 

 It would be open to us, of course, to give no special prominence to an absence of probable cause in bridging the causal gap, and to address this distinct causation concern at a merely general level, leaving it to such pleading and proof as the circumstances allow.  A prosecutor's disclosure of retaliatory thinking on his part, for example, would be of great significance in addressing the presumption and closing the gap. So would evidence that a prosecutor was nothing but a rubber stamp for his investigative staff or the police.  Cf. Mt. Healthy, 429 U.S., at 281-283, 97 S. Ct. 568, 50 L. Ed. 2d 471(evidence that the board of education, which formally decided not to rehire a teacher, was only nominally distinct from the school superintendent, who allegedly bore the retaliatory animus).  In fact, though, these examples are likely to be rare and consequently poor guides in structuring a cause of action. In most cases, for instance, it would be unrealistic to expect a prosecutor to reveal his mind even to the degree that this record discloses, with its reported statement by the prosecutor that he was not galvanized by the merits of the case, but sought the indictment against Moore because he wanted to attract the interest of a law firm looking for a tough trial lawyer. 10 Some may suggest that we should structure a cause of action in the alternative, dispensing with a requirement to show no probable cause when a plaintiff has evidence of a direct admission by a prosecutor that, irrespective of probable cause, the prosecutor's sole purpose in initiating a criminal prosecution was to acquiesce to the inducements of other government agents, who themselves harbored retaliatory animus. Cf. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 469, n. 3, 116 S. Ct. 1480, 134 L. Ed. 2d 687 (1996) (leaving open the question "whether a [criminal] defendant must satisfy the similarly situated requirement in a case 'involving direct admissions by [prosecutors] of discriminatory purpose'" (brackets in original)).  But this would seem a little like proposing that retirement plans include the possibility of winning the lottery.  Unambiguous admissions of successful inducement are likely to be rare, and hassles over the adequacy of admissions will be the predictable result, if any exemption to a no-probable-cause requirement is allowed.

 Accordingly, the significance of probable cause or the lack of it looms large, being a potential feature of every case, with obvious evidentiary value.  True, it is not necessarily dispositive: showing an absence of probable cause may not be conclusive that the inducement succeeded, and showing its presence does not guarantee that inducement was not the but-for fact in a prosecutor's decision.  But a retaliatory motive on the part of an official urging prosecution combined with an absence of probable cause supporting the prosecutor's decision to go forward are reasonable grounds to suspend the presumption  of regularity behind the charging decision, see Bordenkircher v. Hayes,434 U.S. 357, 364, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978) (emphasizing that "so long as the prosecutor has probable cause," the charging decision is generally discretionary), and enough for a prima facie inference that the unconstitutionally motivated inducement infected the prosecutor's decision to bring the charge. 

 Our sense is that the very significance of probable cause means that a requirement to plead and prove its absence will usually be cost free by any incremental reckoning.  The issue is so likely to be raised by some party at some point that treating it as important enough to be an element will be a way to address the issue of causation without adding to time or expense.  See n 7, supra. In this case, for example, Moore cannot succeed in the retaliation claim without showing that the Assistant United States Attorney was worse than just an unabashed careerist, and if he can show that the prosecutor had no probable cause, the claim of retaliation will have some vitality. 

In sum, the complexity of causation in a claim that prosecution was induced by an official bent on retaliation should be addressed specifically in defining the elements of the tort.  Probable cause or its absence will be at least an evidentiary issue in practically all such cases.  Because showing an absence of probable cause will have high probative force, and can be made mandatory with little or no added cost, it makes  sense to require such a showing as an element of a plaintiff's case, and we hold that it must be pleaded and proven. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 

The Chief Justice and Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.  


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC) has established rules that require long-distance (and certain other) communications carriers to compensate a payphone operator when a caller uses a payphone to obtain free access to the carrier's lines (by dialing,e.g., a 1-800 number or other access code). The Commission has added that a carrier's refusal to pay the compensation is a "practice . . . that is unjust or unreasonable" within the terms of the Communications Act of 1934, § 201(b), 48 Stat. 1070, 47 U.S.C. § 201(b). Communications Act language links § 201(b) to § 207, which authorizes any person "damaged" by a violation of § 201(b) to bring a lawsuit to recover damages in federal court. And we must here decide whether this linked section, § 207, authorizes a payphone operator to bring a federal-court lawsuit against a recalcitrant carrier that refuses to pay the compensation that the Commission's order says it owes. 

In our view, the FCC's application of § 201(b) to the carrier's refusal to pay compensation is a reasonable interpretation  of the statute; hence it is lawful. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 843-844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 69, and n. 11 (1984). And, given the linkage with § 207, we also conclude that § 207 authorizes this federal-court lawsuit. 

I 

A 

Because regulatory history helps to illuminate the proper interpretation and application of §§ 201(b) and 207, we begin with that history. When Congress enacted the Communications Act of 1934, it granted the FCC broad authority to regulate interstate telephone communications. See Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 360, 106 S. Ct. 1890, 90 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1986). The Commission, during the first several decades of its history, used this authority to develop a traditional regulatory system much like the systems other commissions had applied when regulating railroads, public utilities, and other common carriers. A utility or carrier would file with a commission a tariff containing rates, and perhaps other practices, classifications, or regulations in connection with its provision of communications services. The commission would examine the rates, etc., and, after appropriate proceedings, approve them, set them aside, or, sometimes, set forth a substitute rate schedule or list of approved charges, classifications, or practices that the carrier or utility must follow. In doing so, the commission might determine the utility's or carrier's overall costs (including a reasonable profit), allocate costs to particular services, examine whether, and how, individual rates would generate revenue that would help cover those costs, and, if necessary, provide for a division of revenues among several carriers that together provided a single service. See 47 U.S.C. §§ 201(b), 203, 205(a); Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of Mo., 262 U.S. 276, 291-295, 43 S. Ct. 544, 67 L. Ed. 981 (1923) (Brandeis, J., concurring in judgment) (telecommunications); Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 478, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002) (same); Chicago & North Western R. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 387 U.S. 326, 331, 87 S. Ct. 1585, 18 L. Ed. 2d 803 (1967) (railroads); Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 761-765, 806-808, 88 S. Ct.  1344, 20 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1968) (natural gas field production). 

In authorizing this traditional form of regulation, Congress copied into the 1934 Communications Act language from the earlier Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 379, which (as amended) authorized federal railroad regulation. See American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524 U.S. 214, 222, 118 S. Ct. 1956, 141 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1998). Indeed, Congress largely copied §§ 1, 8, and 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act when it wrote the language of Communications Act §§ 201(b) and 207, the sections at issue here. The relevant sections (in both statutes) authorize the commission to declare any carrier "charge," "regulation," or "practice" in connection with the carrier's services to be "unjust or unreasonable"; they declare an "unreasonable," e.g., "charge" to be "unlawful"; they authorize an injured person to recover "damages" for an "unlawful" charge or practice; and they state that, to do so, the person may bring suit in a "court" "of the United States." Interstate Commerce Act §§ 1, 8, 9, 24 Stat. 379, 382; Communications Act §§ 201(b), 206, 207; 48 Stat. 1070, 1072, 1073, 47 U.S.C. §§ 201(b), 206, 207. 

Historically speaking, the Interstate Commerce Act sections changed early, preregulatory common-law rate-supervision procedures. The common law originally permitted a freight shipper to ask a court to determine whether a railroad rate was unreasonably high and to award the shipper damages in the form of "reparations." The "new" regulatory law, however, made clear that a commission, not a court, would determine a rate's reasonableness. At the same time, that "new" law permitted a shipper injured by an unreasonable rate to bring a federal lawsuit to collect damages. Interstate Commerce Act §§ 1, 8-9; Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 284 U.S. 370, 383-386, 52 S. Ct. 183, 76 L. Ed. 348 (1932); Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 436, 440-441, 27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553 (1907); Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 162, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183 (1922); Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., 242 U.S. 288, 290-291, 37 S. Ct. 120, 61 L. Ed. 305 (1916); J. Ely, Railroads and American Law 71-72, 226-227 (2001); A. Hoogenboom & O. Hoogenboom, A History of ICC 61 (1976). The similar language of Communications the Act §§ 201(b) and 207 indicates a roughly similar sharing of agency authority with federal courts. 

Beginning in the 1970's, the FCC came to believe that communications markets might efficiently support more than one firm and that competition might supplement (or provide a substitute for) traditional regulation. See MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. AT&T Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220-221, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1994). The Commission facilitated entry of new telecommunications carriers into long-distance markets. And in the 1990's, Congress amended the 1934 Act while also enacting new telecommunications statutes, in order to encourage (and sometimes to mandate) new competition. See Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, 47 U.S.C. § 609 et seq. Neither Congress nor the Commission, however, totally abandoned traditional regulatory requirements. And the new statutes and amendments left many traditional requirements and related statutory provisions, including §§ 201(b) and 207, in place. E.g.,Nat'l Cable & Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 975, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2005). 

B 

The regulatory problem that underlies this lawsuit arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more competitively oriented approaches. Competing long-distance carriers seek the business of individual local callers, including those who wish to make a long-distance call from a local payphone. A payphone operator, however, controls what is sometimes a necessary channel for the caller to reach the long-distance carrier. And prior to 1990, a payphone operator,  exploiting this control, might require a caller to use a long-distance carrier that the operator favored while blocking access to the caller's preferred carrier. Such a practice substituted the operator's choice of carrier for the caller's, and it potentially placed disfavored carriers at a competitive disadvantage. In 1990, Congress enacted special legislation requiring payphone operators to allow a payphone user to obtain "free" access to the carrier of his or her choice, i.e., access from the payphone without depositing coins. Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 986, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 226. (For ease of exposition, we often use familiar terms such as "long distance" and "free" calls instead of more precise terms such as "interexchange" and "coinless" or "dial-around" calls.) 

At the same time, Congress recognized that the "free" call would impose a cost upon the payphone operator; and it consequently required the FCC to "prescribe regulations that . . . establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call." § 276(b)(1)(A) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by § 151 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 106, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A). 

The FCC then considered the compensation problem. Using traditional ratemaking methods, it found that the (fixed and incremental) costs of a "free" call from a payphone to, say, a long-distance carrier warranted reimbursement of (at the time relevant to this litigation) $0.24 per call. The FCC ordered carriers to reimburse the payphone operators in this amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed upon a different amount. 47 CFR § 64.1300(d) (2005). At the same time, it left the carriers free to pass the cost along to their customers, the payphone callers. Thus, in a typical "free" call, the carrier will bill the caller and then must share the revenue the carrier receives--to the tune of $0.24 per call--with the payphone operator that has, together with the carrier,  furnished a communications service to the caller. The FCC subsequently determined that a carrier's refusal to pay the compensation ordered amounts to an "unreasonable practice" within the terms of § 201(b). (We shall refer to these regulations as the Compensation Order and the 2003 Payphone Order, respectively. See Appendix A, infra, for full citations.) See generally P. Huber, M. Kellogg, & J. Thorne, Federal Telecommunications Law § 8.6.3, pp 710-713 (2d ed. 1999) (hereinafter Huber). That determination, it believed, would permit a payphone operator to bring a federal-court lawsuit under § 207 to collect the compensation owed. 2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd. 19975, 19990, P32. 

C 

In 2003, respondent, Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., a payphone operator, brought this federal-court lawsuit against Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc., a long-distance carrier. Metrophones sought compensation that it said Global Crossing owed it under the FCC's Compensation Order, 14 FCC Rcd. 2545 (1999). Insofar as is relevant here, Metrophones claimed that Global Crossing's refusal to pay amounted to a violation of § 201(b), thereby permitting Metrophones to sue in federal court, under § 207, for the compensation owed. The District Court agreed. 423 F.3d 1056, 1061 (CA9 2005). The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's determination. Ibid. We granted certiorari to determine whether § 207 authorizes the lawsuit. 

II 

A 

Section 207 says that "[a]ny person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier . . . may bring suit" against the carrier "in any district court of the United States" for "recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable under the provisions of this chapter." 47 U.S.C. § 207 (emphasis added). This language makes clear that the lawsuit  is proper if the FCC could properly hold that a carrier's failure to pay compensation is an "unreasonable practice" deemed "unlawful" under § 201(b). That is because the immediately preceding section, § 206, says that a common carrier is "liable" for "damages sustained in consequence of" the carrier's doing "any act, matter, or thing in this chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful." And § 201(b) declares "unlawful" any common-carrier "charge, practice, classification, or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable." (See Appendix B, infra, for full text; emphasis added throughout.) 

The history of these sections--including that of their predecessors, §§ 8 and 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act--simply reinforces the language, making clear the purpose of § 207 is to allow persons injured by § 201(b) violations to bring federal-court damages actions. See, e.g.,Arizona Grocery Co., 284 U.S., at 384-385, 52 S. Ct. 183, 76 L. Ed. 2d 348 (Interstate Commerce Act §§ 8-9); Part I-A, supra. History also makes clear that the FCC has long implemented § 201(b) through the issuance of rules and regulations. This is obviously so when the rules take the form of FCC approval or prescription for the future of rates that exclusively are "reasonable." See 47 U.S.C. § 205 (authorizing the FCC to prescribe reasonable rates and practices in order to preclude rates or practices that violate § 201(b)); 5 U.S.C. § 551(4) ("'rule' . . . includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates . . . or practices"). It is also so when the FCC has set forth rules that, for example, require certain accounting methods or insist upon certain carrier practices, while (as here) prohibiting others as unjust or unreasonable under § 201(b). See, e.g. (to name a few), Verizon Tel. Cos. v. FCC, 372 U.S. App. D.C. 15, 453 F.3d 487, 494 (CADC 2006) (rates unreasonable (and hence unlawful) if not adjusted pursuant to accounting rules ordered in FCC regulations); Cable & Wireless P. L. C. v. FCC, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 261, 166 F.3d 1224, 1231 (CADC 1999) (failure to follow Commission-ordered settlement practices unreasonable); MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC,313 U.S. App. D.C. 419, 59 F.3d 1407, 1414 (CADC 1995) (violation of rate-of-return prescription unlawful); In re NOS Communications, Inc., 16 FCC Rcd. 8133, 8136, P6 (2001) (deceptive marketing an unreasonable practice); In re Promotion of Competitive Networks in Local Telecommunications Markets, 15 FCC Rcd. 22983, 23000, P35 (2000) (entering into exclusive contracts with commercial building owners an unreasonable practice). 

Insofar as the statute's language is concerned, to violate a regulation that lawfully implements § 201(b)'s requirements is to violate the statute. See, e.g.,MCI Telecommunications Corp., 59 F.3d at 1414 ("We have repeatedly held that a rate-of-return prescription has the force of law and that the Commission may therefore treat a violation of the prescription as a per se violation of the requirement of the Communications Act that a common carrier maintain 'just and reasonable' rates, see47 U.S.C. § 201(b)"); cf. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 284, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001) (it is "meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute"). That is why private litigants have long assumed that they may, as the statute says, bring an action under § 207 for violation of a rule or regulation that lawfully implements § 201(b). See, e.g.,Oh v. AT&T Corp., 76 F. Supp. 2d 551, 556 (NJ 1999) (assuming validity of § 207 suit alleging violation of § 201(b) in carrier's failure to provide services listed in FCC-approved tariff); Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Allnet Communications Servs., Inc., 789 F. Supp. 302, 304-306 (ED Mo. 1992) (assuming validity of § 207 suit to enforce FCC's determination of reasonable practices related to payment of access charges by long-distance carrier to local exchange carrier); cf., e.g.,Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 609 F.2d 1221, 1224-1225 (CA7 1979) (same in respect to Interstate Commerce Act equivalents of §§ 201(b), 207). 

The difficult question, then, is not whether § 207 covers actions that complain of a violation of § 201(b) as lawfully implemented by an FCC regulation. It plainly does. It remains  for us to decide whether the particular FCC regulation before us lawfully implements § 201(b)'s "un-reasonable practice" prohibition. We now turn to that question. 

B 

 In our view the FCC's § 201(b) "unreasonable practice" determination is a reasonable one; hence it is lawful. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 467 U.S., at 843-844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694. The determination easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase. That is to say, in ordinary English, one can call a refusal to pay Commission-ordered compensation despite having received a benefit from the payphone operator a "practic[e] . . . in connection with [furnishing a] communication service . . . that is . . . unreasonable." The service that the payphone operator provides constitutes an integral part of the total long-distance service the payphone operator and the long-distance carrier together provide to the caller, with respect to the carriage of his or her particular call. The carrier's refusal to divide the revenues it receives from the caller with its collaborator, the payphone operator, despite the FCC's regulation requiring it to do so, can reasonably be called a "practice" "in connection with" the provision of that service that is "unreasonable." Cf. post, at 74, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 444-446 (Thomas, J., dissenting). 

Moreover, the underlying regulated activity at issue here resembles activity that both transportation and communications agencies have long regulated. Here the agency has determined through traditional regulatory methods the cost of carrying a portion (the payphone portion) of a call that begins with a caller and proceeds through the payphone, attached wires, local communications loops, and long-distance lines to a distant call recipient. The agency allocates costs among the joint providers of the communications service and requires downstream carriers, in effect, to pay an appropriate share of revenues to upstream payphone operators. Traditionally, the FCC has determined costs of  some segments of a call while requiring providers of other segments to divide related revenues. See, e.g.,Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 282 U.S. 133, 148-151, 51 S. Ct. 65, 75 L. Ed. 255 (1930) (communications). And traditionally, transportation agencies have determined costs of providing some segments of a larger transportation service (for example, the cost of providing the San Francisco-Ogden segment of a San Francisco-New York shipment) while requiring providers of other segments to divide revenues. See, e.g.,New England Divisions Case, 261 U.S. 184, 43 S. Ct. 270, 67 L. Ed. 605 (1923); Chicago & N. W. R. Co. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 387 U.S. 326, 87 S. Ct. 1585, 18 L. Ed. 2d 803; cf. Cable & Wireless P. L. C., supra, 166 F.3d, at 1231. In all instances an agency allocates costs and provides for a related sharing of revenues. 

 In these more traditional instances, transportation carriers and communications firms entitled to revenues under rate divisions or cost allocations might bring lawsuits under § 207, or the equivalent sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, and obtain compensation or damages. See, e.g.,Allnet Communication Serv., Inc. v. National Exch. Carrier Ass'n, 965 F.2d 1118, 1122 (CADC 1992) (§ 207); Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., supra, at 305 (same); Chicago & North Western Transp. Co., supra, at 1224-1225 (Interstate Commerce Act equivalent of § 207). Again, the similarities support the reasonableness of an agency's bringing about a similar result here. We do not suggest that the FCC is required to find carriers' failures to divide revenues to be § 201(b) violations in every instance. Cf. U.S. Telepacific Corp. v. Tel-America of Salt Lake City, Inc., 19 FCC Rcd. 24552, 24555-24556, and n. 27 (2004) (citing cases). Nor do we suggest that every violation of FCC regulations is an unjust and unreasonable practice. Here there is an explicit statutory scheme, and compensation of payphone operators is necessary to the proper implementation of that scheme. Under these circumstances, the FCC's finding that the failure to follow the order is an unreasonable practice is well within its authority. 

 There are, of course, differences between the present "unreasonable practice" classification and the similar more traditional regulatory subject matter we have just described. For one thing, the connection between payphone operators and long-distance carriers is not a traditional "through route" between carriers. See § 201(a). For another, as Global Crossing's amici point out, the word "practice" in § 201(b) has traditionally applied to a carrier practice that (unlike the present one) is the subject of a carrier tariff--i.e., a carrier agency filing that sets forth the carrier's rates, classifications, and practices. Brief for AT&T et al. as Amici Curiae 8-11. We concede the differences. Indeed, traditionally, the filing of tariffs was "the centerpiece" of the "[Communications] Act's regulatory scheme." MCI Telecomms Corp.,512 U.S., at 220, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182. But we do not concede that these differences require a different outcome. Statutory changes enhancing the role of competition have radically reduced the role that tariffs play in regulatory supervision of what is now a mixed communications system--a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon more traditional regulation. Yet when Congress rewrote the law to bring about these changes, it nonetheless left § 201(b) in place. That fact indicates that the statute permits, indeed it suggests that Congress likely expected, the FCC to pour new substantive wine into its old regulatory bottles. See Policy and Rules Concerning the Interstate, Interexchange Marketplace, 12 FCC Rcd. 15014, 15057, P77 (1997) (despite the absence of tariffs, FCC's § 201 enforcement obligations have not diminished);Boomer v. AT&T Corp., 309 F.3d 404, 422 (CA7 2002) (same). And this circumstance, by indicating that Congress did not forbid the agency to apply § 201(b) differently in the changed regulatory environment, is sufficient to convince us that the FCC's determination is lawful. 

 That is because we have made clear that where "Congress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force  of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law," a court "is obliged to accept the agency's position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency's interpretation" (or the manner in which it fills the "gap") is "reasonable." United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001); National Cable & Telecomms Assn., 545 U.S., at 980, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820; Chevron U.S.A. Inc.,467 U.S., at 843-844, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 69. Congress, in § 201(b), delegated to the agency authority to "fill" a "gap," i.e., to apply § 201 through regulations and orders with the force of law. National Cable & Telecomms. Assn., supra, at 980-981, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820. The circumstances mentioned above make clear the absence of any relevant congressional prohibition. And, in light of the traditional regulatory similarities that we have discussed, we can find nothing unreasonable about the FCC's § 201(b) determination. 

C 

 Global Crossing, its supporting amici, and the dissents make several additional but ultimately unpersuasive arguments. First, Global Crossing claims that § 207 authorizes only actions "seeking damages for statutory violations" and not for "violations merely of regulations promulgated to carry out statutory objectives." Brief for Petitioner 12 (emphasis in original). The lawsuit before us, however, "seek[s] damages for [a] statutoryviolatio[n]," namely, a violation of § 201(b)'s prohibition of an "unreasonable practice." As we have pointed out, supra, at 53-54, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 432,§ 201(b)'s prohibitions have long been thought to extend to rates that diverge from FCC prescriptions, as well as rates or practices that are "unreasonable" in light of their failure to reflect rules embodied in an agency regulation. We have found no limitation of the kind Global Crossing suggests. 

 Global Crossing seeks to draw support from Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2001), and Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 110 S. Ct. 1384, 108 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1990), which, Global Crossing says, hold that an agency cannot determine through regulation when a private party may bring a federal court action. Those cases do involve private actions, but they do not support Global Crossing. The cases involve different statutes and different regulations, and the Court made clear in each of those cases that its holding relied on the specific statute before it. In Sandoval, supra, at 288-289, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517, the Court found that an implied right of action to enforce one statutory provision, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, did not extend to regulations implementing another, § 2000d-1. In contrast, here we are addressing the FCC's reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a substantive statutory provision, 47 U.S.C. § 201(b), which Congress expressly linked to the right of action provided in § 207. Nothing in Sandoval requires us to limit our deference to the FCC's reasonable interpretation of § 201(b); to the contrary, as we noted in Sandoval, it is "meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well." 532 U.S., at 284, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 149 L. Ed. 2d 517. In Adams  Fruit Co., supra, at 646-647, 110 S. Ct. 1384, 108 L. Ed. 2d 585, we rejected an agency interpretation of the worker-protection statute at issue as contrary to "the plain meaning of the statute's language." Given the differences in statutory language, context, and history, those two cases are simply beside the point. 

 Our analysis does not change in this case simply because the practice deemed unreasonable (and hence unlawful) in the 2003 Payphone Order in is violation of an FCC regulation adopted under authority of a separate statutory section, § 276. The FCC here, acting under the authority of § 276, has prescribed a particular rate (and a division of revenues) applicable to a portion of a long-distance service, and it has ordered carriers to reimburse payphone operators for the  relevant portion of the service they jointly provide. But the conclusion that it is "unreasonable" to fail so to reimburse is not a § 276 conclusion; it is a § 201(b) conclusion. And courts have treated a carrier's failure to follow closely analogous agency rate and rate-division determinations as we treat the matter at issue here. That is to say, the FCC properly implements § 201(b) when it reasonably finds that the failure to follow a Commission, e.g., rate or rate-division determination made under a different statutory provision is unjust or unreasonable under § 201(b). See, e.g.,MCI Telecommunications Corp., 59 F.3d at 1414 (failure to follow a rate promulgated under § 205 properly considered unreasonable under § 201(b)); see also Baltimore & O. R. Co. v. Alabama Great Southern R. Co., 165 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 506 F.2d 1265, 1270 (CADC 1974) (statutory obligation to provide reasonable rate divisions is "implemented by orders of the ICC" issued pursuant to a separate statutory provision). Moreover, in resting our conclusion upon the analogy with rate setting and rate divisions, the traditional, historical subject matter of § 201(b), we avoid authorizing the FCC to turn §§ 201(b) and 207 into a back-door remedy for violation of FCC regulations. 

Second, Justice Scalia, dissenting, says that the "only serious issue presented by this case [is] whether a practice that is not in and of itself unjust or unreasonable can be rendered such (and thus rendered in violation of the Act itself) because it violates a substantive regulation of the Commission." Post, at 68, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. He answers this question "no," because, in his view, a "violation of a substantive regulation promulgated by the Commission is not a violation of the Act, and thus does not give rise to a private cause of action." Post, at 69, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. We cannot accept either Justice Scalia's statement of the "serious issue" or his answer. 

 We do not accept his statement of the issue because whether the practice is "in and of itself" unreasonable is irrelevant. The FCC has authoritatively ruled that carriers  must compensate payphone operators. The only practice before us, then, and the only one we consider, is the carrier's violation of that FCC regulation requiring the carrier to pay the payphone operator a fair portion of the total cost of carrying a call that they jointly carried--each supplying a partial portion of the total carriage. A practice of violating the FCC's order to pay a fair share would seem fairly characterized in ordinary English as an "unjust practice," so why should the FCC not call it the same under § 201(b)

Nor can we agree with Justice Scalia's claim that a "violation of a substantive regulation promulgated by the Commission is not a violation of" § 201(b) of the Act when, as here, the Commission has explicitly and reasonably ruled that the particular regulatory violation does violate § 201(b). (Emphasis added.) And what has the substantive/interpretive distinction that Justice Scalia emphasizes, ibid., to do with the matter? There is certainly no reference to this distinction in § 201(b); the text does not suggest that, of all violations of regulations, only violations of interpretive regulations can amount to unjust or unreasonable practices. Why believe that Congress, which scarcely knew of this distinction a century ago before the blossoming of administrative law, would care which kind of regulation was at issue? And even if this distinction were relevant, the FCC has long set forth what we now would call "substantive" (or "legislative") rules under § 205. Cf. 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise § 6.4, p 325 (4th ed. 2002); post, at 70, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 441-442. And violations of those substantive § 205 regulations have clearly been deemed violations of § 201(b). E.g., MCI Telecommunications Corp., 59 F.3d at 1414. Conversely, we have found no case at all in which a private plaintiff was kept out of federal court because the § 201(b) violation it challenged took the form of a "substantive regulation" rather than an "interpretive regulation." Insofar as Justice Scalia uses adjectives such as "traditional" or "textually based" to describe  his distinctions, post, at 71, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 442, and "novel" or "absurd" to describe ours, post, at 72, 68, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 443, 441, we would simply note our disagreement. 

We concede that Justice Scalia cites three sources in support of his theory. See post, at 69-70, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. But, in our view, those sources offer him no support. None of those sources involved an FCC application of, or an FCC interpretation of, the section at issue here, namely, § 201(b). Nor did any involve a regulation--substantive or interpretive--promulgated subsequent to the authority of § 201(b). Thus none is relevant to the case at hand. See APCC Servs., Inc. v. Sprint Communications Co., 368 U.S. App. D.C. 79, 418 F.3d 1238, 1247 (CADC 2005)(per curiam)("There was no authoritative interpretation of § 201(b) in this case"), cert pending, No. 05-766; [decision now reported at: 550 U.S. 901, 127 S. Ct. 2094, 167 L. Ed. 2d 811]. § 201(b) in this case")*[Reporter's Note: For the April 23, 2007, order granting certiorari, vacating the judgment, and remanding APCC Servs., see post, p. 901, 127 S. Ct. 2094, 167 L. Ed. 2d 811.]; Greene v. Sprint Communs. Co., 340 F.3d 1047, 1052 (CA9 2003) (violation of substantive regulation does not violate § 276; silent as to § 201(b)). The single judge who thought that the FCC had authoritatively interpreted § 201(b) (as has occurred in the case before us) would have reached the same conclusion that we do. APCC Servs., Inc., supra, at 1254. (D. H. Ginsburg, C. J., dissenting) (finding a private cause of action, because there was "clearly an authoritative interpretation of § 201(b)" that deemed the practice in question unlawful). See also Huber § 3.14.3, p 317 (no discussion of § 201(b)). 

Third, Justice Thomas (who also does not adopt Justice Scalia's arguments) disagrees with the FCC's interpretation of the term "practice." He, along with Global Crossing, claims instead that §§ 201(a) and (b) concern only practices that harm carrier customers, not carrier suppliers.Post, at 67-70, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 444-445 (Scalia, J. ,dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 37-38. But that is not what those sections say. Nor does history offer this position significant support. A violation of a regulation or order dividing rates among railroads, for example, would  likely have harmed another carrier, not a shipper. See, e.g.,Chicago & North Western Transp. Co.,609 F.2d at 1225-1226 ("Act . . . provides for the regulation of inter-carrier relations as a part of its general rate policy"). Once one takes account of this fact, it seems reasonable, not unreasonable, to include as a § 201(b) (and § 207) beneficiary a firm that performs services roughly analogous to the transportation of one segment of a longer call. We are not here dealing with a firm that supplies office supplies or manual labor. Cf., e.g., Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Norwood, 283 U.S. 249, 257, 51 S. Ct. 458, 75 L. Ed. 1010 (1931) ("practice" in § 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act does not encompass employment decisions). The long-distance carrier ordered by the FCC to compensate the payphone operator is so ordered in its role as a provider of communications services, not as a consumer of office supplies or the like. It is precisely because the carrier and the payphone operator jointly provide a communications service to the caller that the carrier is ordered to share with the payphone operator the revenue that only the carrier is permitted to demand from the caller. Cf. Cable & Wireless P. L. C., 166 F.3d at 1231 (finding that § 201(b) enables the Commission to regulate not "only the terms on which U. S. carriers offer telecommunication services to the public," but also "the prices U. S. carriers pay" to foreign carriers providing the foreign segment of an international call). 

Fourth, Global Crossing argues that the FCC's "unreasonable practice" determination is unlawful because it is inadequately reasoned. We concede that the FCC's initial opinion simply states that the carrier's practice is unreasonable under § 201(b). But the context and cross-referenced opinions, 2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd., at 19990, P 32 (citing American Public Communications Council v. FCC, 342 U.S. App. D.C. 51, 215 F.3d 51, 56 (CADC 2000)), make the FCC's rationale obvious, namely, that in light of the history that we set forth supra, at 53-54, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 428-430, it is unreasonable for a carrier to violate the FCC's  mandate that it pay compensation. See also In re APCC Servs., Inc. v. NetworkIP, LLC, 21 FCC Rcd. 10488, 10493-10495, PP 13-16 (2006) (spelling out the reasoning). 

Fifth, Global Crossing argues that a different statutory provision, § 276, see supra, at 51, 167 L. Ed. 2d, at 430, prohibits the FCC's § 201(b) classification. Brief for Petitioner 26-28. But § 276 simply requires the FCC to "take all actions necessary . . . to prescribe regulations that . . . establish a per call compensation plan to ensure" that payphone operators "are fairly compensated." 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1). It nowhere forbids the FCC to rely on § 201(b). Rather, by helping to secure enforcement of the mandated regulations the FCC furthers basic § 276 purposes. 

Finally, Global Crossing seeks to rest its claim of a § 276 prohibition upon the fact that § 276 requires regulations that secure compensation for "every completed intrastate," as well as every "interstate", payphone-related call, while § 201(b) (referring to § 201(a)) extends only to "interstate or foreign" communication. Brief for Petitioner 37. But Global Crossing makes too much of too little. We can assume (for argument's sake) that § 201(b) may consequently apply only to a portion of the Compensation Order's requirements. But cf., e.g.,Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 476 U.S., at 375, 106 S. Ct. 1890, 90 L. Ed. 2d 369 n. 4(suggesting approval of FCC authority where it is "not possible to separate the interstate and the intrastate components"). But even if that is so (and we repeat that we do not decide this question), the FCC's classification will help to achieve a substantial portion of its § 276 compensatory mission. And we cannot imagine why Congress would have (implicitly in this § 276 language) wished to prohibit the FCC from concluding that an interstate half loaf is better than none. 

For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

"It is a principle of general application in Anglo-American jurisprudence that one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process."  Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. 22 (1940).  Several exceptions, recognized in this Court's decisions, temper this basic rule.  In a class action, for example, a person not named as a party may be bound by a judgment on the merits of the action, if she was adequately represented by a party who actively participated in the litigation.  See id., at 41, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. 22.  In this case, we consider for the first time whether there is a "virtual representation" exception to the general rule against precluding nonparties.  Adopted by a number of courts, including the courts below in the case now before us, the exception so styled is broader than any we have so far approved. 

 The virtual representation question we examine in this opinion arises in the following context.  Petitioner Brent Taylor filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking certain documents from the Federal Aviation Administration.  Greg Herrick, Taylor's friend, had previously brought an unsuccessful suit seeking the same records.  The two men have no legal relationship, and there is no evidence that Taylor controlled, financed, participated in, or even had notice of Herrick's earlier suit.  Nevertheless, the D. C. Circuit held Taylor's suit precluded by the judgment against Herrick because, in that court's assessment, Herrick qualified as Taylor's "virtual representative." 

We disapprove the doctrine of preclusion by "virtual representation," and hold, based on the record as it now stands, that the judgment against Herrick does not bar Taylor from maintaining this suit. 

I 

  The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA or Act) accords "any person" a right to request any records held by a federal agency.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).  No reason need be given for a FOIA request, and unless the requested materials fall within one of the Act's enumerated exemptions, see § 552(a)(3)(E), (b), the agency must "make the records promptly available" to the requester, § 552(a)(3)(A).  If an agency refuses to furnish the requested records, the requester may file suit in federal court and obtain an injunction "order[ing] the production of any agency records improperly withheld."  § 552(a)(4)(B). 

The courts below held the instant FOIA suit barred by the judgment in earlier litigation seeking the same records.  Because the lower courts' decisions turned on the connection between the two lawsuits, we begin with a full account of each action. 

A

The first suit was filed by Greg Herrick, an antique aircraft enthusiast and the owner of an F-45 airplane, a vintage  model manufactured by the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation (FEAC) in the 1930's.  In 1997, seeking information that would help him restore his plane to its original condition, Herrick filed a FOIA request asking the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for copies of any technical documents about the F-45 contained in the agency's records. 

To gain a certificate authorizing the manufacture and sale of the F-45, FEAC had submitted to the FAA's predecessor, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, detailed specifications and other technical data about the plane.  Hundreds of pages of documents produced by FEAC in the certification process remain in the FAA's records.  The FAA denied Herrick's request, however, upon finding that the documents he sought are subject to FOIA's exemption for "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," § 552(b)(4).  In an administrative appeal, Herrick urged that FEAC and its successors had waived any trade-secret protection.  The FAA thereupon contacted FEAC's corporate successor, respondent Fairchild Corporation (Fairchild).  Because Fairchild objected to release of the documents, the agency adhered to its original decision. 

Herrick then filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the District of Wyoming.  Challenging the FAA's invocation of the trade-secret exemption, Herrick placed heavy weight on a 1955 letter from FEAC to the Civil Aeronautics Authority.  The letter authorized the agency to lend any documents in its files to the public "for use in making repairs or replacement parts for aircraft produced by Fairchild."  Herrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184, 1193 (CA10 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This broad authorization, Herrick maintained, showed that the F-45 certification records held by the FAA could not be regarded as "secre[t]" or "confidential" within the meaning of § 552(b)(4). 

Rejecting Herrick's argument, the District Court granted summary judgment to the FAA.  Herrick v. Garvey, 200 F. Supp. 2d 1321, 1328-1329 (Wyo. 2000).  The 1955 letter, the court reasoned, did not deprive the F-45 certification documents of trade-secret status, for those documents were never in fact released pursuant to the letter's blanket authorization.  See id., at 1329.  The court also stated that even if the 1955 letter had waived trade-secret protection, Fairchild had successfully "reversed" the waiver by objecting to the FAA's release of the records to Herrick.  Ibid.

On appeal, the Tenth Circuit agreed with Herrick that the 1955 letter had stripped the requested documents of trade-secret protection.  See Herrick, 298 F.3d at 1194.  But the Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's alternative determination—i.e., that Fairchild had restored trade-secret status by objecting to Herrick's FOIA request. Id., at 1195.  On that ground, the appeals court affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the FAA. 

In so ruling, the Tenth Circuit noted that Herrick had failed to challenge two suppositions underlying the District Court's decision.  First, the District Court assumed trade-secret status could be "restored" to documents that had lost protection.  Id., at 1194, n. 10.  Second, the District Court also assumed that Fairchild had regained trade-secret status for the documents even though the company claimed that status only "after Herrick had initiated his request" for the F-45 records. Ibid.  The Court of Appeals expressed no opinion on the validity of these suppositions.  See id., at 1194-1195, n. 10. 

B

The Tenth Circuit's decision issued on July 24, 2002.  Less than a month later, on August 22, petitioner Brent Taylor—a friend of Herrick's and an antique aircraft enthusiast in his own right—submitted a FOIA request seeking the same documents Herrick had unsuccessfully sued to obtain.  When the FAA failed to respond, Taylor filed a complaint in the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Like Herrick, Taylor argued that FEAC's 1955 letter had stripped  the records of their trade-secret status.  But Taylor also sought to litigate the two issues concerning recapture of protected status that Herrick had failed to raise in his appeal to the Tenth Circuit. 

After Fairchild intervened as a defendant,1Although Fairchild provided documents to the Wyoming District Court and filed an amicus brief in the Tenth Circuit, it was not a party to Herrick's suit.  See Herrick v. Garvey, 298 F.3d 1184, 1188 (CA10 2002); Herrick v. Garvey, 200 F. Supp. 2d 1321, 1327 (Wyo. 2000).the District Court in D. C. concluded that Taylor's suit was barred by claim preclusion; accordingly, it granted summary judgment to Fairchild and the FAA.  The court acknowledged that Taylor was not a party to Herrick's suit.  Relying on the Eighth Circuit's decision in Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449 (1996), however, it held that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was "virtually represented" by a party.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a-31a. 

The Eighth Circuit's seven-factor test for virtual representation, adopted by the District Court in Taylor's case, requires an "identity of interests" between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.  See id., at 31a.  See also Tyus, 93 F.3d at 455.  Six additional factors counsel in favor of virtual representation under the Eighth Circuit's test, but are not prerequisites:  (1) a "close relationship" between the present party and a party to the judgment alleged to be preclusive; (2) "participation in the prior litigation" by the present party; (3) the present party's "apparent acquiescence" to the preclusive effect of the judgment; (4) "deliberat[e] maneuver[ing]" to avoid the effect of the judgment; (5) adequate representation of the present party by a party to the prior adjudication; and (6) a suit raising a "public law" rather than a "private law" issue.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a (citing Tyus, 93 F.3d at 454-456).  These factors, the D. C. District Court observed, "constitute a fluid test with imprecise boundaries" and call for "a broad, case-by-case inquiry."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a. 

 The record before the District Court in Taylor's suit revealed the following facts about the relationship between Taylor and Herrick:  Taylor is the president of the Antique Aircraft Association, an organization to which Herrick belongs; the two men are "close associate[s]," App. 54; Herrick asked Taylor to help restore Herrick's F-45, though they had no contract or agreement for Taylor's participation in the restoration; Taylor was represented by the lawyer who represented Herrick in the earlier litigation; and Herrick apparently gave Taylor documents that Herrick had obtained from the FAA during discovery in his suit. 

Fairchild and the FAA conceded that Taylor had not participated in Herrick's suit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.  The D. C. District Court determined, however, that Herrick ranked as Taylor's virtual representative because the facts fit each of the other six indicators on the Eighth Circuit's list.  See id., at 32a-35a.  Accordingly, the District Court held Taylor's suit, seeking the same documents Herrick had requested, barred by the judgment against Herrick.  See id., at 35a. 

The D. C. Circuit affirmed.  It observed, first, that other Circuits "vary widely" in their approaches to virtual representation.  Taylor v. Blakey, 377 U.S. App. D.C. 12, 490 F.3d 965, 971 (2007).  In this regard, the D. C. Circuit contrasted the multifactor balancing test applied by the Eighth Circuit and the D. C. District Court with the Fourth Circuit's narrower approach, which "treats a party as a virtual representative only if the party is 'accountable to the nonparties who file a subsequent suit' and has 'the tacit approval of the court' to act on the nonpart[ies'] behalf."  Ibid. (quoting Klugh v. United States, 818 F.2d 294, 300 (CA4 1987)). 

Rejecting both of these approaches, the D. C. Circuit announced its own five-factor test.  The first two factors—"identity of interests" and "adequate representation"—are necessary but not sufficient for virtual representation.  490 F.3d at 971-972.  In addition, at least one of three other  factors must be established:  "a close relationship between the present party and his putative representative," "substantial participation by the present party in the first case," or "tactical maneuvering on the part of the present party to avoid preclusion by the prior judgment."  Id., at 972. 

Applying this test to the record in Taylor's case, the D. C. Circuit found both of the necessary conditions for virtual representation well met.  As to identity of interests, the court emphasized that Taylor and Herrick sought the same result—release of the F-45 documents.  Moreover, the D. C. Circuit observed, Herrick owned an F-45 airplane, and therefore had, "if anything, a stronger incentive to litigate" than Taylor, who had only a "general interest in public disclosure and the preservation of antique aircraft heritage."  Id., at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Turning to adequacy of representation, the D. C. Circuit acknowledged that some other Circuits regard notice of a prior suit as essential to a determination that a nonparty was adequately represented in that suit.  See id., at 973-974 (citing Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 312 (CA1 2001), and Tice v. American Airlines, Inc., 162 F.3d 966, 973 (CA7 1998)).  Disagreeing with these courts, the D. C. Circuit deemed notice an "important" but not an indispensable element in the adequacy inquiry.  The court then concluded that Herrick had adequately represented Taylor even though Taylor had received no notice of Herrick's suit.  For this conclusion, the appeals court relied on Herrick's "strong incentive to litigate" and Taylor's later engagement of the same attorney, which indicated to the court Taylor's satisfaction with that attorney's performance in Herrick's case.  See 490 F.3d at 974-975. 

 The D. C. Circuit also found its "close relationship" criterion met, for Herrick had "asked Taylor to assist him in restoring his F-45" and "provided information to Taylor that Herrick had obtained through discovery"; furthermore, Taylor "did not oppose Fairchild's characterization of Herrick  as his 'close associate.'"  Id., at 975.  Because the three above-described factors sufficed to establish virtual representation under the D. C. Circuit's five-factor test, the appeals court left open the question whether Taylor had engaged in "tactical maneuvering."  See id., at 976 (calling the facts bearing on tactical maneuvering "ambigu[ous]").2The D. C. Circuit did not discuss the District Court's distinction between public-law and private-law claims.

We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. 1136, 128 S. Ct. 977, 169 L. Ed. 2d 800 (2008), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits over the permissibility and scope of preclusion based on "virtual representation."3The Ninth Circuit applies a five-factor test similar to the D. C. Circuit's.  See Kourtis v. Cameron, 419 F.3d 989, 996 (2005).  The Fifth, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits, like the Fourth Circuit, have constrained the reach of virtual representation by requiring, inter alia, the existence of a legal relationship between the nonparty to be bound and the putative representative.  See Pollard v. Cockrell, 578 F.2d 1002, 1008 (CA5 1978); Becherer v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 193 F.3d 415, 424 (CA6 1999) (en banc); EEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 383 F.3d 1280, 1289 (CA11 2004).  The Seventh Circuit, in contrast, has rejected the doctrine of virtual representation altogether.  See Perry v. Globe Auto Recycling, Inc., 227 F.3d 950, 953 (2000).

II

  The preclusive effect of a federal-court judgment is determined by federal common law.  See Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 507-508, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (2001).  For judgments in federal-question cases—for example, Herrick's FOIA suit— federal courts participate in developing "uniform federal rule[s]" of res judicata, which this Court has ultimate authority to determine and declare. Id., at 508, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32.4For judgments in diversity cases, federal law incorporates the rules of preclusion applied by the State in which the rendering court sits.  See Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 508, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. Ed. 2d 32 (2001).  The federal common law of preclusion is, of course, subject to due process limitations.  See Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 797, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1996).

 Taylor's case presents an issue of first impression in this sense:  Until now, we have never addressed the doctrine of "virtual representation" adopted (in varying forms) by several Circuits and relied upon by the courts below.  Our inquiry, however, is guided by well-established precedent regarding the propriety of nonparty preclusion.  We review that precedent before taking up directly the issue of virtual representation. 

A

  The preclusive effect of a judgment is defined by claim preclusion and issue preclusion, which are collectively referred to as "res judicata."5These terms have replaced a more confusing lexicon.  Claim preclusion describes the rules formerly known as "merger" and "bar," while issue preclusion encompasses the doctrines once known as "collateral estoppel" and "direct estoppel."  See Migra v. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U.S. 75, 77, n. 1, 104 S. Ct. 892, 79 L. Ed. 2d 56 (1984).  Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, a final judgment forecloses "successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit."  New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 748, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001).  Issue preclusion, in contrast, bars "successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment," even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.  Id., at 748-749, 121 S. Ct. 1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968.  By "preclud[ing] parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate," these two doctrines protect against "the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserv[e] judicial resources, and foste[r] reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions."  Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153-154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979).

A person who was not a party to a suit generally has not had a "full and fair opportunity to litigate" the claims and issues settled in that suit.  The application of claim and issue preclusion to nonparties thus runs up against the "deep-rooted  historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court."  Richards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indicating the strength of that tradition, we have often repeated the general rule that "one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process."  Hansberry, 311 U.S., at 40, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. 22.  See also, e.g., Richards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76; Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 761, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1989); Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 110, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969).

  Though hardly in doubt, the rule against nonparty preclusion is subject to exceptions.  For present purposes, the recognized exceptions can be grouped into six categories.6The established grounds for nonparty preclusion could be organized differently.  See, e.g., 1 & 2 Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 39-62 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement); D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure:  Preclusion in Civil Actions 75-92 (2001); 18A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4448, pp 327-329 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).  The list that follows is meant only to provide a framework for our consideration of virtual representation, not to establish a definitive taxonomy.

First, "[a] person who agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others is bound in accordance with the terms of his agreement."  1 Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 40, p 390 (1980) (hereinafter Restatement).  For example, "if separate actions involving the same transaction are brought by different plaintiffs against the same defendant, all the parties to all the actions may agree that the question of the defendant's liability will be definitely determined, one way or the other, in a 'test case.'"  D. Shapiro, Civil Procedure:  Preclusion in Civil Actions 77-78 (2001) (hereinafter Shapiro).  See also California v. Texas, 459 U.S. 1096, 1097, 103 S. Ct. 714, 74 L. Ed. 2d 944 (1983) (dismissing certain defendants from a suit based on a stipulation "that each of  said defendants . . . will be bound by a final judgment of this Court" on a specified issue).7The Restatement observes that a nonparty may be bound not only by express or implied agreement, but also through conduct inducing reliance by others.  See 2 Restatement § 62.  See also 18A Wright & Miller § 4453, at 425-429.  We have never had occasion to consider this ground for nonparty preclusion, and we express no view on it here.

Second, nonparty preclusion may be justified based on a variety of pre-existing "substantive legal relationship[s]" between the person to be bound and a party to the judgment.  Shapiro 78.  See also Richards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  Qualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and succeeding owners of property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor.  See 2 Restatement §§ 43-44, 52, 55.  These exceptions originated "as much from the needs of property law as from the values of preclusion by judgment."  18A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4448, p 329 (2d ed. 2002) (hereinafter Wright & Miller).8The substantive legal relationships justifying preclusion are sometimes collectively referred to as "privity."  See, e.g., Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1996); 2 Restatement § 62, Comment a.  The term "privity," however, has also come to be used more broadly, as a way to express the conclusion that nonparty preclusion is appropriate on any ground.  See 18A Wright & Miller § 4449, at 351-353, and n 33 (collecting cases).  To ward off confusion, we avoid using the term "privity" in this opinion.

Third, we have confirmed that, "in certain limited circumstances," a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was "adequately represented by someone with the same interests who [wa]s a party" to the suit.  Richards, 517 U.S., at 798, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Representative suits with preclusive effect on nonparties include properly conducted class actions, see Martin, 490 U.S., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835 (citing Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23), and suits brought by trustees, guardians, and other fiduciaries, see Sea-Land Services,  Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U.S. 573, 593, 94 S. Ct. 806, 39 L. Ed. 2d 9 (1974).  See also 1 Restatement § 41. 

Fourth, a nonparty is bound by a judgment if she "assume[d] control" over the litigation in which that judgment was rendered.  Montana, 440 U.S., at 154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210.  See also Schnell v. Peter Eckrich & Sons, Inc., 365 U.S. 260, 262, n. 4, 81 S. Ct. 557, 5 L. Ed. 2d 546 (1961); 1 Restatement § 39.  Because such a person has had "the opportunity to present proofs and argument," he has already "had his day in court" even though he was not a formal party to the litigation.  Id., Comment a, at 382. 

Fifth, a party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating through a proxy.  Preclusion is thus in order when a person who did not participate in a litigation later brings suit as the designated representative of a person who was a party to the prior adjudication.  See Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Schendel, 270 U.S. 611, 620, 623, 46 S. Ct. 420, 70 L. Ed. 757 (1926); 18A Wright & Miller § 4454, at 433-434.  And although our decisions have not addressed the issue directly, it also seems clear that preclusion is appropriate when a nonparty later brings suit as an agent for a party who is bound by a judgment.  See id., § 4449, at 335. 

Sixth, in certain circumstances a special statutory scheme may "expressly foreclos[e] successive litigation by nonlitigants . . . if the scheme is otherwise consistent with due process."  Martin, 490 U.S., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835.  Examples of such schemes include bankruptcy and probate proceedings, see ibid., and quo warranto actions or other suits that, "under [the governing] law, [may] be brought only on behalf of the public at large," Richards, 517 U.S., at 804, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76. 

III

Reaching beyond these six established categories, some lower courts have recognized a "virtual representation" exception to the rule against nonparty preclusion.  Decisions of these courts, however, have been far from consistent.  See 18A Wright & Miller § 4457, at 513 (virtual representation lacks a "clear or coherent theory"; decisions applying it have "an episodic quality").  Some Circuits use the label, but define "virtual representation" so that it is no broader than the recognized exception for adequate representation.  See, e.g., Becherer v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 193 F.3d 415, 423, 427 (CA6 1999) (en banc).  But other courts, including the Eighth, Ninth, and D. C. Circuits, apply multifactor tests for virtual representation that permit nonparty preclusion in cases that do not fit within any of the established exceptions.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 165-167, and n 3. 

The D. C. Circuit, the FAA, and Fairchild have presented three arguments in support of an expansive doctrine of virtual representation.  We find none of them persuasive. 

A

The D. C. Circuit purported to ground its virtual representation doctrine in this Court's decisions stating that, in some circumstances, a person may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the proceeding yielding that judgment.  See 490 F.3d at 970-971.  But the D. C. Circuit's definition of "adequate representation" strayed from the meaning our decisions have attributed to that term. 

In Richards, we reviewed a decision by the Alabama Supreme Court holding that a challenge to a tax was barred by a judgment upholding the same tax in a suit filed by different taxpayers.  517 U.S., at 795-797, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  The plaintiffs in the first suit "did not sue on behalf of a class," their complaint "did not purport to assert any claim against or on behalf of any nonparties," and the judgment "did not purport to bind" nonparties. Id., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  There was no indication, we emphasized, that the court in the first suit "took care to protect the interests" of absent parties, or that the parties to that litigation "understood their suit to be on behalf of absent [parties]."  Id., at 802, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  In these circumstances, we held, the application  of claim preclusion was inconsistent with "the due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."  Id., at 797, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76. 

The D. C. Circuit stated, without elaboration, that it did not "read Richards to hold a nonparty . . . adequately represented only if special procedures were followed [to protect the nonparty] or the party to the prior suit understood it was representing the nonparty."  490 F.3d at 971.  As the D. C. Circuit saw this case, Herrick adequately represented Taylor for two principal reasons:  Herrick had a strong incentive to litigate; and Taylor later hired Herrick's lawyer, suggesting Taylor's "satisfaction with the attorney's performance in the prior case."  Id., at 975. 

The D. C. Circuit misapprehended Richards.  As just recounted, our holding that the Alabama Supreme Court's application of res judicata to nonparties violated due process turned on the lack of either special procedures to protect the nonparties' interests or an understanding by the concerned parties that the first suit was brought in a representative capacity.  See Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76. Richards thus established that representation is "adequate" for purposes of nonparty preclusion only if (at a minimum) one of these two circumstances is present. 

We restated Richards' core holding in South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U.S. 160, 119 S. Ct. 1180, 143 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1999).  In that case, as in Richards, the Alabama courts had held that a judgment rejecting a challenge to a tax by one group of taxpayers barred a subsequent suit by a different taxpayer.  See 526 U.S., at 164-165, 119 S. Ct. 1180, 143 L. Ed. 2d 258.  In South Central Bell, however, the nonparty had notice of the original suit and engaged one of the lawyers earlier employed by the original plaintiffs.  See id., at 167-168, 119 S. Ct. 1180, 143 L. Ed. 2d 258.  Under the D. C. Circuit's decision in Taylor's case, these factors apparently would have sufficed to establish adequate representation.  See 490 F.3d at 973-975.  Yet South Central Bell held that the application of res judicata in that case violated due process.  Our inquiry came  to an end when we determined that the original plaintiffs had not understood themselves to be acting in a representative capacity and that there had been no special procedures to safeguard the interests of absentees.  See 526 U.S., at 168, 119 S. Ct. 1180, 143 L. Ed. 2d 258. 

Our decisions recognizing that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she was adequately represented by a party to the earlier suit thus provide no support for the D. C. Circuit's broad theory of virtual representation. 

B

Fairchild and the FAA do not argue that the D. C. Circuit's virtual representation doctrine fits within any of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion.  Rather, they ask us to abandon the attempt to delineate discrete grounds and clear rules altogether.  Preclusion is in order, they contend, whenever "the relationship between a party and a non-party is 'close enough' to bring the second litigant within the judgment."  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22-24.  Courts should make the "close enough" determination, they urge, through a "heavily fact-driven" and "equitable" inquiry.  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  See also Brief for Respondent FAA 22 ("there is no clear test" for nonparty preclusion; rather, an "equitable and fact-intensive" inquiry is demanded (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Only this sort of diffuse balancing, Fairchild and the FAA argue, can account for all of the situations in which nonparty preclusion is appropriate. 

We reject this argument for three reasons.  First, our decisions emphasize the fundamental nature of the general rule that a litigant is not bound by a judgment to which she was not a party.  See, e.g.,Richards, 517 U.S., at 798-799, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76; Martin, 490 U.S., at 761-762, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835.  Accordingly, we have endeavored to delineate discrete exceptions that apply in "limited circumstances."  Id., at 762, n. 2, 109 S. Ct. 2180, 104 L. Ed. 2d 835.  Respondents' amorphous balancing test is at odds with the constrained approach to nonparty preclusion our decisions advance. 

 Resisting this reading of our precedents, respondents call up three decisions they view as supportive of the approach they espouse.  Fairchild quotes our statement in Coryell v. Phipps, 317 U.S. 406, 411, 63 S. Ct. 291, 87 L. Ed. 363 (1943), that privity "turns on the facts of particular cases."  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  That observation, however, scarcely implies that privity is governed by a diffuse balancing test.9Moreover, Coryell interpreted the term "privity" not in the context of res judicata, but as used in a statute governing shipowner liability.  See Coryell v. Phipps, 317 U.S. 406, 407-408, 63 S. Ct. 291, 87 L. Ed. 363, and n. 1 (1943).  And we made the statement Fairchild quotes in explaining why it was appropriate to defer to the findings of the lower courts, not as a comment on the substantive rules of privity.  See id., at 411, 63 S. Ct. 291, 87 L. Ed. 363.  Fairchild also cites Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Ill. Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 334, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971), which stated that estoppel questions turn on "the trial courts' sense of justice and equity."  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 20.  This passing statement, however, was not made with nonparty preclusion in mind; it appeared in a discussion recognizing district courts' discretion to limit the use of issue preclusion against persons who were parties to a judgment.  See Blonder-Tongue, 402 U.S., at 334, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788.

The FAA relies on United States v. Des Moines Valley R. Co., 84 F. 40 (CA8 1897), an opinion we quoted with approval in Schendel, 270 U.S., at 619-620, 46 S. Ct. 420, 70 L. Ed. 757.  Des Moines Valley was a quiet title action in which the named plaintiff was the United States.  The Government, however, had "no interest in the land" and had "simply permitted [the landowner] to use its name as the nominal plaintiff."  84 F., at 42.  The suit was therefore barred, the appeals court held, by an earlier judgment against the landowner.  As the court explained:  "[W]here the government lends its name as a plaintiff . . . to enable one private person to maintain a suit against another," the government is "subject to the same defenses which exist . . . against the real party in interest."  Id., at 43. Des Moines Valley, the FAA contended at oral argument, demonstrates that it is sometimes appropriate to bind  a nonparty in circumstances that do not fit within any of the established grounds for nonparty preclusion.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-33.  Properly understood, however, Des Moines Valley is simply an application of the fifth basis for nonparty preclusion described above:  A party may not use a representative or agent to relitigate an adverse judgment.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 169-170.10The FAA urges that there was no agency relationship between the landowner and the United States because the landowner did not control the U. S. Attorney's conduct of the suit.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.  That point is debatable.  See United States v. Des Moines Valley R. Co., 84 F. 40, 42-43 (CA8 1897) (the United States was only a "nominal plaintiff"; it merely "len[t]" its name to the landowner).  But even if the FAA is correct about agency, the United States plainly litigated as the landowner's designated representative.  See id., at 42 ("The bill does not attempt to conceal the fact that . . . its real purpose is to champion the cause of [the landowner] . . . .").  See also Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. Schendel, 270 U.S. 611, 618-620, 46 S. Ct. 420, 70 L. Ed. 757 (1926) (classifying Des Moines Valley with other cases of preclusion based on representation).  We thus find no support in our precedents for the lax approach to nonparty preclusion advocated by respondents. 

Our second reason for rejecting a broad doctrine of virtual representation rests on the limitations attending nonparty preclusion based on adequate representation.   A party's representation of a nonparty is "adequate" for preclusion purposes only if, at a minimum:  (1) The interests of the nonparty and her representative are aligned, see Hansberry, 311 U.S., at 43, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. 22; and (2) either the party understood herself to be acting in a representative capacity or the original court took care to protect the interests of the nonparty, see Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76; supra, at ____ - ____, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 167-168.  In addition, adequate representation sometimes requires (3) notice of the original suit to the persons alleged to have been represented, see Richards, 517 U.S., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.11Richards suggested that notice is required in some representative suits, e.g., class actions seeking monetary relief.  See 517 U.S., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (citing Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 40, 61 S. Ct. 115, 85 L. Ed. 22 (1940), Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974), and Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 319, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950)).  But we assumed without deciding that a lack of notice might be overcome in some circumstances.  See Richards, 517 U.S., at 801, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  In the class-action context,  these limitations are implemented by the procedural safeguards contained in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.

An expansive doctrine of virtual representation, however, would "recogniz[e], in effect, a common-law kind of class action."  Tice, 162 F.3d at 972 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is, virtual representation would authorize preclusion based on identity of interests and some kind of relationship between parties and nonparties, shorn of the procedural protections prescribed inHansberry, Richards, and Rule 23.  These protections, grounded in due process, could be circumvented were we to approve a virtual representation doctrine that allowed courts to "create de facto class actions at will."  Tice, 162 F.3d at 973. 

Third, a diffuse balancing approach to nonparty preclusion would likely create more headaches than it relieves.  Most obviously, it could significantly complicate the task of district courts faced in the first instance with preclusion questions.  An all-things-considered balancing approach might spark wide-ranging, time-consuming, and expensive discovery tracking factors potentially relevant under seven- or five-prong tests.  And after the relevant facts are established, district judges would be called upon to evaluate them under a standard that provides no firm guidance.  See Tyus, 93 F.3d at 455 (conceding that "there is no clear test for determining the applicability of" the virtual representation doctrine announced in that case).   Preclusion doctrine, it should be recalled, is intended to reduce the burden of litigation on courts and parties.  Cf. Montana, 440 U.S., at 153-154, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210.  "In this area of the law," we agree, "'crisp rules with sharp corners' are preferable to a round-about doctrine of opaque standards."  Bittinger v. Tecumseh Products Co., 123 F.3d 877, 881 (CA6 1997). 

 C

Finally, relying on the Eighth Circuit's decision in Tyus, 93 F.3d at 456, the FAA maintains that nonparty preclusion should apply more broadly in "public law" litigation than in "private law" controversies.  To support this position, the FAA offers two arguments.  First, the FAA urges, our decision in Richards acknowledges that, in certain cases, the plaintiff has a reduced interest in controlling the litigation "because of the public nature of the right at issue."  Brief for Respondent FAA 28. When a taxpayer challenges "an alleged misuse of public funds" or "other public action," we observed in Richards, the suit "has only an indirect impact on [the plaintiff's] interests."  517 U.S., at 803, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  In actions of this character, the Court said, "we may assume that the States have wide latitude to establish procedures . . . to limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained."  Ibid.

Taylor's FOIA action falls within the category described in Richards, the FAA contends, because "the duty to disclose under FOIA is owed to the public generally."  Brief for Respondent FAA 34.  The opening sentence of FOIA, it is true, states that agencies "shall make [information] available to the public."  5 U.S.C. § 552(a) (2006 ed.).  Equally true, we have several times said that FOIA vindicates a "public" interest.  E.g., National Archives and Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 172, 124 S. Ct. 1570, 158 L. Ed. 2d 319 (2004).  The Act, however, instructs agencies receiving FOIA requests to make the information available not to the public at large, but rather to the "person" making the request.  § 552(a)(3)(A).  See also § 552(a)(3)(B) ("In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any [readily reproducible] form or format requested by the person . . . ." (emphasis added)); Brief for National Security Archive et al. as Amici Curiae 10 ("Government agencies do not systematically make released records available to the general public.").  Thus, in contrast to the public-law litigation  contemplated inRichards, a successful FOIA action results in a grant of relief to the individual plaintiff, not a decree benefiting the public at large. 

Furthermore,  we said in Richards only that, for the type of public-law claims there envisioned, States are free to adopt procedures limiting repetitive litigation.  See 517 U.S., at 803, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.  In this regard, we referred to instances in which the first judgment foreclosed successive litigation by other plaintiffs because, "under state law, [the suit] could be brought only on behalf of the public at large."  Id., at 804, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76.12Nonparty preclusion in such cases ranks under the sixth exception described above:  special statutory schemes that expressly limit subsequent suits.  See supra, at ____, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 170.Richards spoke of state legislation, but it appears equally evident that Congress, in providing for actions vindicating a public interest, may "limit the number of judicial proceedings that may be entertained."  Id., at 803, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76. It hardly follows, however, that this Court should proscribe or confine successive FOIA suits by different requesters.  Indeed, Congress' provision for FOIA suits with no statutory constraint on successive actions counsels against judicial imposition of constraints through extraordinary application of the common law of preclusion. 

The FAA next argues that "the threat of vexatious litigation is heightened" in public-law cases because "the number of plaintiffs with standing is potentially limitless."  Brief for Respondent FAA 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FOIA does allow "any person" whose request is denied to resort to federal court for review of the agency's determination.  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A), (4)(B) (2006 ed.).  Thus it is theoretically possible that several persons could coordinate to mount a series of repetitive lawsuits. 

But we are not convinced that this risk justifies departure from the usual rules governing nonparty preclusion.  First, stare decisis will allow courts swiftly to dispose of repetitive suits brought in the same circuit.  Second, even when stare  decisis is not dispositive, "the human tendency not to waste money will deter the bringing of suits based on claims or issues that have already been adversely determined against others."  Shapiro 97.  This intuition seems to be borne out by experience:  The FAA has not called our attention to any instances of abusive FOIA suits in the Circuits that reject the virtual representation theory respondents advocate here. 

IV

For the foregoing reasons,  we disapprove the theory of virtual representation on which the decision below rested.  The preclusive effects of a judgment in a federal-question case decided by a federal court should instead be determined according to the established grounds for nonparty preclusion described in this opinion.  See Part II-B, supra.

Although references to "virtual representation" have proliferated in the lower courts, our decision is unlikely to occasion any great shift in actual practice.  Many opinions use the term "virtual representation" in reaching results at least arguably defensible on established grounds.  See 18A Wright & Miller § 4457, at 535-539, and n 38 (collecting cases).  In these cases, dropping the "virtual representation" label would lead to clearer analysis with little, if any, change in outcomes.  See Tice, 162 F.3d at 971.  ("[T]he term 'virtual representation' has cast more shadows than light on the problem [of nonparty preclusion]."). 

In some cases, however, lower courts have relied on virtual representation to extend nonparty preclusion beyond the latter doctrine's proper bounds.  We now turn back to Taylor's action to determine whether his suit is such a case, or whether the result reached by the courts below can be justified on one of the recognized grounds for nonparty preclusion. 

A

It is uncontested that four of the six grounds for nonparty preclusion have no application here:  There is no indication  that Taylor agreed to be bound by Herrick's litigation, that Taylor and Herrick have any legal relationship, that Taylor exercised any control over Herrick's suit, or that this suit implicates any special statutory scheme limiting relitigation.  Neither the FAA nor Fairchild contends otherwise. 

 It is equally clear that preclusion cannot be justified on the theory that Taylor was adequately represented in Herrick's suit.  Nothing in the record indicates that Herrick understood himself to be suing on Taylor's behalf, that Taylor even knew of Herrick's suit, or that the Wyoming District Court took special care to protect Taylor's interests.  Under our pathmarking precedent, therefore, Herrick's representation was not "adequate."  See Richards, 517 U.S., at 801-802, 116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76. 

That leaves only the fifth category:  preclusion because a nonparty to an earlier litigation has brought suit as a representative or agent of a party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  Taylor is not Herrick's legal representative and he has not purported to sue in a representative capacity.  He concedes, however, that preclusion would be appropriate if respondents could demonstrate that he is acting as Herrick's "undisclosed agen[t]."  Brief for Petitioner 23, n 4.  See also id., at 24, n 5. 

Respondents argue here, as they did below, that Taylor's suit is a collusive attempt to relitigate Herrick's action.  See Brief for Respondent Fairchild 32, and n 18; Brief for Respondent FAA 18-19, 33, 39.  The D. C. Circuit considered a similar question in addressing the "tactical maneuvering" prong of its virtual representation test.  See 490 F.3d at 976.  The Court of Appeals did not, however, treat the issue as one of agency, and it expressly declined to reach any definitive conclusions due to "the ambiguity of the facts."  Ibid.  We therefore remand to give the courts below an opportunity to determine whether Taylor, in pursuing the instant FOIA suit, is acting as Herrick's agent.  Taylor concedes that such a remand is appropriate.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 56-57. 

 We have never defined the showing required to establish that a nonparty to a prior adjudication has become a litigating agent for a party to the earlier case.  Because the issue has not been briefed in any detail, we do not discuss the matter elaboratively here.  We note, however, that  courts should be cautious about finding preclusion on this basis.  A mere whiff of "tactical maneuvering" will not suffice; instead, principles of agency law are suggestive.  They indicate that preclusion is appropriate only if the putative agent's conduct of the suit is subject to the control of the party who is bound by the prior adjudication.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency § 14, p 60 (1957) ("A principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.").13Our decision in Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1979), also suggests a "control" test for agency.  In that case, we held that the United States was barred from bringing a suit because it had controlled a prior unsuccessful action filed by a federal contractor.  See id., at 155, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210.  We see no reason why preclusion based on a lesser showing would have been appropriate if the order of the two actions had been switched—that is, if the United States had brought the first suit itself, and then sought to relitigate the same claim through the contractor.  See Schendel, 270 U.S., at 618, 46 S. Ct. 420, 70 L. Ed. 757 ("[I]f, in legal contemplation, there is identity of parties" when two suits are brought in one order, "there must be like identity" when the order is reversed.).

B

On remand, Fairchild suggests, Taylor should bear the burden of proving he is not acting as Herrick's agent.  When a defendant points to evidence establishing a close relationship between successive litigants, Fairchild maintains, "the burden [should] shif[t] to the second litigant to submit evidence refuting the charge" of agency.  Brief for Respondent Fairchild 27-28.  Fairchild justifies this proposed burden-shift on the ground that "it is unlikely an opposing party will have access to direct evidence of collusion."  Id., at 28, n 14. 

 We reject Fairchild's suggestion.   Claim preclusion, like issue preclusion, is an affirmative defense.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c); Blonder-Tongue, 402 U.S., at 350, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788.  Ordinarily, it is incumbent on the defendant to plead and prove such a defense, see Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 204, 127 S. Ct. 910, 166 L. Ed. 2d 798 (2007), and we have never recognized claim preclusion as an exception to that general rule, see 18 Wright & Miller § 4405, at 83 ("[A] party asserting preclusion must carry the burden of establishing all necessary elements.").  We acknowledge that direct evidence justifying nonparty preclusion is often in the hands of plaintiffs rather than defendants.  See, e.g., Montana, 440 U.S., at 155, 99 S. Ct. 970, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210 (listing evidence of control over a prior suit).  But "[v]ery often one must plead and prove matters as to which his adversary has superior access to the proof."  2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence § 337, p 475 (6th ed. 2006).  In these situations, targeted interrogatories or deposition questions can reduce the information disparity.  We see no greater cause here than in other matters of affirmative defense to disturb the traditional allocation of the proof burden.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. 

This case arose from a fatal driveby shooting into a group of students standing in front of a Seattle high school.  Brian  Ronquillo was ultimately identified as the gunman; at the time of the shooting, he was a passenger in a car driven by respondent Cesar Sarausad II.  A jury convicted Sarausad as an accomplice to second-degree murder, attempted murder, and assault; he was sentenced to just over 27 years of imprisonment.  The Washington courts affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct review, and his state-court motions for postconviction relief were denied. 

Respondent, then, filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The District Court granted the writ.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed with the District Court that the state-court decision was an objectively "unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals found it unreasonable for the state court to reject Sarausad's argument that certain jury instructions used at his trial were ambiguous and were likely misinterpreted by the jury to relieve the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  Sarausad v. Porter, 479 F.3d 671 (2007).  We disagree.  Because the Washington courts reasonably applied our precedent to the facts of this case, we reverse the judgment below. 

I 

A 

The driveby shooting was the culmination of a gang dispute between the 23d Street Diablos, of which Cesar Sarausad was a member, and the Bad Side Posse, which was headquartered at Ballard High School in Seattle, Washington.  A member of the Diablos, Jerome Reyes, had been chased from Ballard by members of the Bad Side Posse, so the Diablos decided to go "to Ballard High School to show that the Diablos were not afraid" of the rival gang.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 235a.  The Diablos started a fight with the Bad Side Posse, but left quickly after someone indicated that  police were nearby.  They went to a gang member's house, still angry because the Bad Side Posse had "called [them] weak."  Tr. 2660-2661.  Brian Ronquillo retrieved a handgun, and the gang decided to return to Ballard and "get [their] respect back."  Id., at 2699. 

Sarausad drove, with Ronquillo in the front passenger seat and Reyes and two other Diablos in the back seat.  En route, someone in the car mentioned "'capping'" the Bad Side Posse, and Ronquillo tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and readied the handgun. Sarausad v. State, 109 Wn. App. 824, 844, 39 P. 3d 308, 319 (2001).  Shortly before reaching the high school, a second car of Diablos pulled up next to Sarausad's car and the drivers of the two cars talked briefly.  Sarausad asked the other driver, "'Are you ready?'"  id., at 844-845, 39 P. 3d, at 319, and then sped the rest of the way to the high school.  Once in front of the school, Sarausad abruptly slowed to about five miles per hour while Ronquillo fired 6 to 10 shots at a group of students standing in front of it.  Id., at 831, 39 P. 3d, at 312.  Sarausad "saw everyone go down," Tr. 2870, and then sped away, 109 Wn. App. , at 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.  The gunfire killed one student; another student was wounded when a bullet fragment struck his leg.  Id., at 831-832, 39 P. 3d, at 312-313. 

B 

Sarausad, Ronquillo, and Reyes were tried for the first-degree murder of Melissa Fernandes, the attempted first-degree murders of Ryan Lam and Tam Nguyen, and the second-degree assault of Brent Mason.  Sarausad and Reyes, who were tried as accomplices, argued at trial that they could not have been accomplices to murder because they "had no idea whatsoever that Ronquillo had armed himself for the return trip."  Id., at 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.  They claimed that they expected, at most, another fistfight with the Bad Side Posse and were "totally and utterly dismayed when Ronquillo started shooting."  Ibid.

Sarausad's counsel, in particular, argued that there was no evidence that Sarausad expected anything more than that the two gangs "would exchange insults, and maybe, maybe get into a fight."  Tr. 1151.  Sarausad testified that he considered only the "possibility of a fight," id., at 2799, but never the possibility of a shooting, 109 Wn. App. , at 832, 39 P. 3d, at 313.  During closing arguments, Sarausad's attorney again argued that the evidence showed only that Sarausad was "willing to fight them the way they fought them the first time.  And that is by pushing and shoving and more tough talk."  App. 81.  That was not sufficient, the attorney argued, to find that "Cesar [Sarausad] had knowledge that his assistance would promote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder."  Id., at 83.  Sarausad's attorney also explained to the jury that knowledge of just any crime, such as knowledge that criminal assistance would be rendered after the shooting, would be insufficient to hold Sarausad responsible as an accomplice to murder because "[a]ccomplice liability requires that one assists with knowledge, that their actions will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime."  Id., at 100 (emphasis added). 

In response, the prosecutor focused much of her closing argument on the evidence of Sarausad's knowledge of a shooting.  He had "slowed down before the shots were fired, stayed slowed down until the shots were over and immediately sped up."  Id., at 39.  "There was no hesitation, there was no stopping the car.  There was no attempt for Mr. Sarausad to swerve his car out of the way so that innocent people wouldn't get shot."  Id., at 40.  She also argued that Sarausad knew when he drove back to the school that his gang's "fists didn't work, the pushing didn't work, the flashing of the signs, the violent altercation didn't work" because the Bad Side Posse still "laughed at them, they called them weak, they called them nothing."  Id., at 44.  So, "[w]hen they rode down to Ballard High School that last time, . . .  [t]hey knew they were there to commit a crime, to disrespect the gang, to fight, to shoot, to get that respect back.  A fist didn't work, pushing didn't work.  Shouting insults at them didn't work.  Shooting was going to work.  In for a dime, you're in for a dollar."  Id., at 123-124. 

At the close of trial, the jury received two instructions that directly quoted Washington's accomplice-liability statute.1Washington's accomplice-liability statute provides, in pertinent part: "A person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.  A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when: . . . . . "He is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the crime. "A person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of a crime if . . . [w]ith knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he "(i) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests such other person to commit it; or "(ii) aids or agrees to aid such other person in planning or committing it."  Wash. Rev. Code §§ 9A.08.020(1)-(3) (2008) (internal numbering omitted).  Instruction number 45 provided: 

"You are instructed that a person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.  A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of the crime." Id., at 16 (emphasis added).

Instruction number 46 provided, in relevant part: "A person is an accomplice in the commission of a crime if, with knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime, he or she either: "(1) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests another person to commit the crime or "(2) aids or agrees to aid another person in planning or committing the crime."  Id., at 17 (emphasis added).

 During seven days of deliberations, the jury asked five questions, three of which related to the intent requirement for accomplice liability.  One questioned the accomplice-liability standard as it related to the first-degree murder instructions; one questioned the standard as it related to the second-degree murder instructions; and one stated that the jury was "having difficulty agreeing on the legal definition and concept of 'accomplice'" and whether a person's "willing participat[ion] in a group activity" makes "that person an accomplice to any crime committed by anyone in the group."  Id., at 129.  In response to each question, the judge instructed the jury to reread the accomplice-liability instructions and to consider the instructions as a whole. 

The jury was unable to reach a verdict as to Reyes, and the judge declared a mistrial as to him.  The jury then returned guilty verdicts on all counts for Ronquillo and convicted Sarausad of the lesser included crimes of second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and second-degree assault. 

C 

On appeal, Sarausad argued that because the State did not prove that he had intent to kill, he could not be convicted as an accomplice to second-degree murder under Washington law.  The Washington Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions, explaining that under Washington law, an accomplice must have "general knowledge" that the crime will occur, but need not have the specific intent required for that crime's commission.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 259a.  The court referred to accomplice liability as "a theory of criminal liability that in Washington has been reduced to the maxim, 'in for a dime, in for a dollar.'"  Id., at 235a.  The Washington Supreme Court denied discretionary review.  State v. Ronquillo, 136 Wn. 2d 1018, 966 P.2d 1277 (1998). 

Shortly thereafter, the Washington Supreme Court clarified in an unrelated criminal case that "in for a dime, in for a dollar" is not the best descriptor of accomplice liability under  Washington law because an accomplice must have knowledge of "the crime" that occurs. State v. Roberts, 142 Wn. 2d 471, 509-510, 14 P. 3d 713, 734-735 (2000).  Therefore, an accomplice who knows of one crime—the dime—is not guilty of a greater crime—the dollar—if he has no knowledge of that greater crime.  It was error, then, to instruct a jury that an accomplice's knowledge of "'a crime'" was sufficient to establish accomplice liability for "'the crime.'"  Ibid.2The instruction found faulty in Roberts provided in full: "You are instructed that a person is guilty of a crime if it is committed by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable.  A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person when he is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of a crime."A person is an accomplice in the commission of a crime, whether present at the time of its commission or not, if, with knowledge that it will promote or facilitate its commission, he either: "(a) solicits, commands, encourages, or requests another person to commit the crime; or "(b) aids another person in planning or committing the crime."  142 Wash. 2d, at 488-489, 14 P. 3d, at 724 (emphasis added).  The Washington Supreme Court limited this decision to instructions containing the phrase "a crime" and explicitly reaffirmed its precedent establishing that jury instructions linking an accomplice's knowledge to "the crime," such as the instruction used at Sarausad's trial, comport with Washington law.  Id., at 511-512, 14 P. 3d, at 736 (discussing State v. Davis, 101 Wn. 2d 654, 656, 682 P.2d 883, 884 (1984)).  An instruction that references "the crime" "copie[s] exactly the language from the accomplice liability statute" and properly hinges criminal punishment on knowledge of "the crime" for which the defendant was charged as an accomplice.  142 Wash. 2d, at 512, 14 P. 3d, at 736. 

D 

Sarausad next sought postconviction relief from the Washington courts.  He argued that although the accomplice-liability instruction used at his trial complied with Roberts,  "an additional clarifying instruction should have been given" because the prosecutor may have confused the jury by improperly arguing that he had been "'in for a dime, in for a dollar.'"  Sarausad,109 Wn. App., at 829, 39 P. 3d, at 311.  Therefore, he argued, the jury may have convicted him as an accomplice to second-degree murder based solely on his admission that he anticipated that an assault would occur at Ballard High School. 

The Washington Court of Appeals reexamined the trial record in its entirety in light of Roberts,see 109 Wn. App., at 834, 39 P. 3d, at 313-314, but found no error requiring correction.  According to the court, the prosecutor's closing argument in its entirety did not convey "that the jury could find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice to murder if he had the purpose to facilitate an offense of any kind whatsoever, even a shoving match or fist fight."  Id., at 840, 39 P. 3d, at 317.  The prosecutor's "'in for a dime, in for a dollar'" illustration also did not convey that standard. Id., at 842-843, 39 P. 3d, at 318.  The court explained that in every situation but one, the prosecutor clearly did not use that phrase to argue that Sarausad could be convicted of murder if he intended only a fistfight.  Instead, she used it to convey a "gang mentality" that requires a wrong to the gang to be avenged by any means necessary. Id. at 842, 39 P. 3d, at 318. Thus, according to the prosecutor, when a fight did not work, Sarausad knew that a shooting was required to avenge his gang.  See ibid.

There was one "in for a dime, in for a dollar" hypothetical in the prosecutor's closing that did not convey this gang-mentality meaning and thus, the court recognized, "may or may not be problematic under Roberts" depending on how it was interpreted.  Id., at 843, 39 P. 3d, at 318.3The prosecutor had argued in the hypothetical that an accomplice who knows that he is helping someone assault a victim bears responsibility if the victim is killed.  The hypothetical stated in full: "Let me give you a good example of accomplice liability.  A friend comes up to you and says, 'Hold this person's arms while I hit him.'  You say, 'Okay, I don't like that person, anyway.'  You hold the arms.  The person not only gets assaulted, he gets killed.  You are an accomplice and you can't come back and say, 'Well, I only intended this much damage to happen.'  Your presence, your readiness to assist caused the crime to occur and you are an accomplice.  The law in the State of Washington says, if you're in for a dime, you're in for a dollar.  If you're there or even if you're not there and you're helping in some fashion to bring about this crime, you are just as guilty."  App. 38.  The court  concluded that it did not need to decide whether the hypothetical was improper under state law because, even if it was, it did not prejudice Sarausad.  Sarausad's jury was properly instructed and "the prosecutor made it crystal clear to the jury that the State wanted Sarausad found guilty . . . because he knowingly facilitated the drive-by shooting and for no other reason."  Id., at 843-844, 39 P. 3d, at 319. 

Sarausad sought discretionary postconviction review from the Supreme Court of Washington.  In denying his petition, the court held that "the trial court correctly instructed the jury" that knowledge of the particular crime committed was required.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a.  The court also found that no prejudicial error resulted from the prosecutor's potentially improper hypothetical.  Id., at 192a.  "[W]hatever the flaws in the argument, the prosecutor properly focused on Mr. Sarausad's knowing participation in the shooting, not in some lesser altercation."  Ibid.

E 

Sarausad filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The District Court granted the petition, finding "ample evidence that the jury was confused about what elements had to be established in order for [Sarausad] to be found guilty of second degree murder and second degree attempted murder."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, finding that the state postconviction court unreasonably applied this Court's decisions in Estelle  v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991), Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979), and In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), in affirming Sarausad's conviction in spite of ambiguous jury instructions and the "'reasonable likelihood that the jury . . . applied the challenged instruction in a way' that violates the Constitution."  479 F.3d at 683 (quoting Estelle, supra, at 72, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385).  The court denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of five judges. Sarausad v. Porter,503 F.3d 822 (2007).  We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. 1256, 128 S. Ct. 1650, 170 L. Ed. 2d 352 (2008), and now reverse. 

II 

  Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, a federal court may grant habeas relief on a claim "adjudicated on the merits" in state court only if the decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  Where, as here, it is the state court's application of governing federal law that is challenged, the decision "'must be shown to be not only erroneous, but objectively unreasonable.'"  Middleton v. McNeil, 541 U.S. 433, 436, 124 S. Ct. 1830, 158 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2004)(per curiam) (quoting Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 5, 124 S. Ct. 1, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2003)(per curiam)); see also Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007) ("The question under AEDPA is not whether a federal court believes the state court's determination was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable—a substantially higher threshold"). 

  Our habeas precedent places an "especially heavy" burden on a defendant who, like Sarausad, seeks to show constitutional error from a jury instruction that quotes a state statute. Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 155, 97 S. Ct. 1730, 52 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1977).  Even if there is some "ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency" in the instruction, such an error does not necessarily constitute a due process violation. Middleton, supra, at 437, 124 S. Ct. 1830, 158 L. Ed. 2d 701.  Rather, the defendant must show both that the instruction was ambiguous  and that there was "'a reasonable likelihood'" that the jury applied the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Estelle, supra, at 72, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (quoting Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S. Ct. 1190, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1990)).  In making this determination, the jury instruction "'may not be judged in artificial isolation,' but must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole and the trial record."  Estelle, supra, at 72, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (quoting Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S. Ct. 396, 38 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1973)).  Because it is not enough that there is some "slight possibility" that the jury misapplied the instruction, Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 236, 120 S. Ct. 727, 145 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2000), the pertinent question "is 'whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process,'" Estelle, supra, at 72, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (quoting Cupp, supra, at 147, 94 S. Ct. 396, 38 L. Ed. 2d 368). 

A 

The Washington courts reasonably concluded that the trial court's instruction to the jury was not ambiguous.  The instruction parroted the language of the statute, requiring that an accomplice "in the commission of the crime" take action "with knowledge that it will promote or facilitate the commission of the crime." App. 16-17 (emphasis added); Wash. Rev. Code §§ 9A.08.020(2)(c), (3)(a) (2008).  It is impossible to assign any meaning to this instruction different from the meaning given to it by the Washington courts.  By its plain terms, it instructed the jury to find Sarausad guilty as an accomplice "in the commission of the [murder]" only if he acted "with knowledge that [his conduct] will promote or facilitate the commission of the [murder]."  App. 16-17.4The dissent would reverse the Washington state courts based on the alleged confusion in Washington courts, and specifically in the Washington Court of Appeals on direct review, about the meaning of the Washington accomplice liability statute. Post, at 198-200, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 546-549 (opinion of Souter, J.).  But the confusion in the Court of Appeals over the application of the statute involved the related, but legally distinct, question whether an accomplice is required to share the specific intent of the principal actor under Washington law.  On direct appeal, respondent argued that he should not have been convicted as an accomplice to murder because he did not have the specific intent to kill.  The Washington Court of Appeals rejected that argument because "it was not necessary for the State to prove Sarausad knew Ronquillo had a gun, or knew that there was a potential for gunplay that day" under Washington law, App. to Pet. for Cert. 266a, where "accomplice liability predicates criminal liability on general knowledge of a crime, rather than specific knowledge of the elements of the principal's crime," id., at 259a.  But the Washington Court of Appeals never held that knowledge of a completely different crime, such as assault, would be sufficient under Washington law for accomplice liability for murder.  See id., at 258a-259a; see also In re Domingo, 155 Wn. 2d 356, 367-368, 119 P. 3d 816, 822 (2005) ("[N]either Davis nor any of this court's decisions subsequent to Davis approves of the proposition that accomplice liability attaches for any and all crimes committed by the principal so long as the putative accomplice knowingly aided in any one of the crimes").  In other words, the Court of Appeals had evaluated whether respondent's conviction required a specific intent versus a general intent to kill, not whether it required knowledge of a murder versus knowledge of an assault—the issue under review here.  Thus, the confusion in the state courts referenced by the dissent has no bearing on the question presented in this appeal, and does not support the dissent's argument that the jury instruction in question was ambiguous.  Because  the conclusion reached by the Washington courts that the jury instruction was unambiguous was not objectively unreasonable, the Court of Appeals' 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) inquiry should have ended there.5To the extent that the Court of Appeals attempted to rewrite state law by proposing that the instruction should have included "an explicit statement that an accomplice must have knowledge of . . . the actual crime the principal intends to commit," 479 F.3d 671, 690 (CA9 2007), it compounded its error.  The Washington Supreme Court expressly held that the jury instruction correctly set forth state law, App. to Pet. for Cert. 191a, and we have repeatedly held that  "it is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions."  Estelle v. McGuire,502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S. Ct. 475, 116 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991).

B 

Even if we agreed that the instruction was ambiguous, the Court of Appeals still erred in finding that the instruction  was so ambiguous as to cause a federal constitutional violation, as required for us to reverse the state court's determination under AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).  The Washington courts reasonably applied this Court's precedent when they determined that there was no "reasonable likelihood" that the prosecutor's closing argument caused Sarausad's jury to apply the instruction in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  The prosecutor consistently argued that Sarausad was guilty as an accomplice because he acted with knowledge that he was facilitating a driveby shooting.  Indeed, Sarausad and Reyes had admitted under oath that they anticipated a fight, Tr. 2671, 2794, and yet the prosecutor never argued that their admission was a concession of accomplice liability for murder.  She instead argued that Sarausad knew that a shooting was intended, App. 123, because he drove his car in a way that would help Ronquillo "fire those shots," id., at 39.  The closing argument of Sarausad's attorney also homed in on the key legal question:  He challenged the jury to look for evidence that Sarausad "had knowledge that his assistance would promote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder" and argued that no such evidence existed.  Id., at 83. 

Put simply, there was no evidence of ultimate juror confusion as to the test for accomplice liability under Washington law.  Rather, the jury simply reached a unanimous decision that the State had proved Sarausad's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Indeed, every state and federal appellate court that reviewed the verdict found that the evidence supporting Sarausad's knowledge of a shooting was legally sufficient to convict him under Washington law.  479 F.3d at 677-683; Sarausad,109 Wn. App. , at 844-845, 39 P. 3d, at 319.  Given the strength of the evidence supporting the conviction, along with the jury's failure to convict Reyes—who also had been charged as an accomplice to murder and also had admitted knowledge of a possible fight—it was not objectively  unreasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted Sarausad only because it believed that he, unlike Reyes, had knowledge of more than just a fistfight.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeals, which failed to review the state courts' resolution of this question through the deferential lens of AEDPA, does not convince us otherwise. 

First, the Court of Appeals found that the evidence of Sarausad's knowledge of the shooting was so "thin" that the jury must have incorrectly believed that proof of such knowledge was not required.  479 F.3d, at 692-693.  That conclusion, however, is foreclosed by the Court of Appeals' own determination that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to reasonably infer that Sarausad knowingly facilitated the driveby shooting.  As explained above, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the evidence showed that Ronquillo, while seated in Sarausad's front passenger seat, tied a bandana over the lower part of his face and pulled out a gun.  Id., at 681.  There also was evidence that Sarausad then asked the Diablos in the other car, "'Are you ready?'" before driving to the school and "slow[ing] his car in front of the school in a manner that facilitated a drive-by shooting."  Ibid.  Other gang members testified to prior knowledge of the gun and to discussing the shooting as an option during the gang meeting held between trips to Ballard High School.  Id., at 682.  There also was testimony from Sarausad that he suspected that members of the Bad Side Posse would be armed when they returned to Ballard High School, ibid., making it reasonable to conclude that Sarausad would expect his gang to be similarly prepared for the confrontation.  There was nothing "thin" about the evidence of Sarausad's guilt. 

Second, the Court of Appeals faulted the prosecutor for arguing "clearly and forcefully" for an "'in for a dime, in for a dollar'" theory of accomplice liability. Id., at 693.  But the Washington Court of Appeals conducted an in-depth analysis of the prosecutor's argument and reasonably found  that it contained, at most, one problematic hypothetical. Sarausad, supra, at 842-843, 39 P. 3d, at 318-319. The state court's conclusion that the one hypothetical did not taint the proper instruction of state law was reasonable under this Court's precedent, which acknowledges that "arguments of counsel generally carry less weight with a jury than do instructions from the court."  Boyde, 494 U.S., at 384, 110 S. Ct. 1190, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316.  On habeas review, the Court of Appeals should not have dissected the closing argument and exaggerated the possible effect of one hypothetical in it.  There was nothing objectively unreasonable about the Washington courts' resolution of this question.6The dissent accuses us of downplaying this ambiguous hypothetical, arguing that it is so rife with improper meaning that it "infect[ed] every further statement bearing on accomplice law the prosecutor made," post, at 202, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 549, and ensured that the jury misinterpreted the trial court's properly-phrased instruction.  We disagree.  The proper inquiry is whether the state court was objectively unreasonable in concluding that the instruction (which precisely tracked the language of the accomplice-liability statute) was not warped by this one-paragraph hypothetical in an argument and rebuttal spanning 31 pages of the joint appendix. The state court's conclusion was not unreasonable.  The hypothetical was presented during closing arguments, which juries generally "vie[w] as the statements of advocates" rather than "as definitive and binding statements of the law," Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 384, 110 S. Ct. 1190, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1990), and which, as a whole, made clear that the State sought a guilty verdict based solely on Sarausad's "knowledge that his assistance would promote or facilitate the crime of premeditated murder," App. 83; see also id., at 123-124.

Third, and last, the Court of Appeals believed that the jury's questions "demonstrated substantial confusion about what the State was required to prove."  479 F.3d, at 693.  Sarausad focuses special attention on this factor, arguing that it was the "failure to remedy" this confusion that sets this case apart from previous decisions and establishes that the jury likely "did not understand accomplice liability" when it returned its verdict.  Brief for Respondent 29, 31.  But this Court has determined that the Constitution generally requires nothing more from a trial judge than the type of  answers given to the jury here.  Weeks, 528 U.S., at 234, 120 S. Ct. 727, 145 L. Ed. 2d 727.  Where a judge "respond[s] to the jury's question by directing its attention to the precise paragraph of the constitutionally adequate instruction that answers its inquiry," and the jury asks no followup question, this Court has presumed that the jury fully understood the judge's answer and appropriately applied the jury instructions.  Ibid.

Under this established standard, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that Sarausad's jury received the answers it needed to resolve its confusion.7The dissent argues that we "sideste[p] the thrust of this record" by finding that the trial judge's answers to the jury's questions were satisfactory.  Post, at 205, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 551.  But our decision cannot turn on a de novo review of the record or a finding that the answers were "the best way to answer jurors' questions," ibid. On federal habeas review, this Court's inquiry is limited to whether the state court violated clearly established federal law when it held that the jury applied the correct standard, in light of the answers given to its questions.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  On that issue, the state court was not objectively unreasonable; the jury's questions were answered in a manner previously approved by this Court, and they consistently referred the jury to the correct standard for accomplice liability in Washington.  The dissent also ignores the important fact that the jury convicted Ronquillo of first-degree murder, convicted respondent of second-degree murder, and failed to reach an agreement on Reyes' guilt, causing a mistrial on the first-degree murder charge pending against him.  The jury's assignment of culpability to two of the codefendants, versus its deadlock over a third who, like respondent, conceded knowledge of an assault, demonstrates that the jury understood the legal significance of each defendant's relative knowledge and intent with respect to the murder.  Its questions were spaced throughout seven days of deliberations, involved different criminal charges, and implicated the interrelation of several different jury instructions.  The judge pinpointed his answers to the particular instructions responsive to the questions and those instructions reflected state law.  Under these circumstances, the state court did not act in an objectively unreasonable manner in finding that the jury knew the proper legal standard for conviction. 

 III 

Because the state-court decision did not result in an "unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law," 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the Court of Appeals erred in granting a writ of habeas corpus to Sarausad.  The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.*Justice Thomas joins all but Part III of this opinion.

The federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. § 921 et seq., has long prohibited possession of a firearm by any person convicted of a felony.  In 1996, Congress extended the prohibition to include persons convicted of "a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence."  § 922(g)(9).  The definition of "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence," contained in § 921(a)(33)(A), is at issue in this case.  Does that term cover a misdemeanor battery whenever the battered victim was in fact the offender's spouse (or other relation specified in § 921(a)(33)(A))?  Or, to trigger the possession ban, must the predicate misdemeanor identify as an element of the crime a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim?  We hold that  the domestic relationship, although it must be established beyond a reasonable doubt in a § 922(g)(9) firearms possession prosecution, need not be a defining element of the predicate offense. 

I 

In 2004, law enforcement officers in Marion County, West Virginia, came to the home of Randy Edward Hayes in response to a 911 call reporting domestic violence.  Hayes consented to a search of his home, and the officers discovered a rifle.  Further investigation revealed that Hayes had recently possessed several other firearms as well.  Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned an indictment in 2005, charging Hayes, under §§ 922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2), with  three counts of possessing firearms after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. 

The indictment identified Hayes's predicate misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as a 1994 conviction for battery in violation of West Virginia law.1West Virginia's battery statute provides:   "[A]ny person [who] unlawfully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking nature with the person of another or unlawfully and intentionally causes physical harm to another person, . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."  W. Va. Code Ann. § 61-2-9(c) (Lexis 2005).  The victim of that battery, the indictment alleged, was Hayes's then-wife--a person who "shared a child in common" with Hayes and "who was cohabitating with . . . him as a spouse."  App. 3.2The indictment stated, in relevant part: "Defendant RANDY EDWARD HAYES' February 24, 1994 Battery conviction . . . constituted a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because: "a. Battery is a misdemeanor under State law in West Virginia; "b. Battery has, as an element, the use and attempted use of physical force; "c. Defendant RANDY EDWARD HAYES committed the offense of Battery against the victim: "i. who was his current spouse; and "ii. who was a person with whom he shared a child in common; and "iii. who was cohabitating with and had cohabitated with him as a spouse."  App. 2-3 (bold typeface deleted).

Asserting that his 1994 West Virginia battery conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under § 922(g)(9), Hayes moved to dismiss the indictment. Section 922(g)(9), Hayes maintained, applies only to persons previously convicted of an offense that has as an element a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim.  The West Virginia statute under which he was convicted in 1994, Hayes observed, was a generic battery proscription, not a law designating a domestic relationship between offender and victim as an element of the offense.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia rejected Hayes's argument and denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.  377 F. Supp. 2d 540, 541-542 (2005).  Hayes then entered a conditional guilty plea and appealed. 

In a 2-to-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.  A § 922(g)(9) predicate offense, the Court of Appeals held, must "have as an element a domestic relationship between the offender and the victim."  482 F.3d 749, 751 (2007).  In so ruling, the Fourth Circuit created a split between itself and the nine other Courts of Appeals that had previously published opinions deciding the same question.3See United States v. Heckenliable, 446 F.3d 1048, 1049 (CA10 2006); United States v. Belless, 338 F.3d 1063, 1067 (CA9 2003); White v. DOJ, 328 F.3d 1361, 1364-1367 (CA Fed. 2003); United States v. Shelton, 325 F.3d 553, 562 (CA5 2003); United States v. Kavoukian, 315 F.3d 139, 142-144 (CA2 2002); United States v. Barnes, 353 U.S. App. D.C. 87, 295 F.3d 1354, 1358-1361 (CADC 2002); United States v. Chavez, 204 F.3d 1305, 1313-1314 (CA11 2000); United States v. Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 218-221 (CA1 1999); United States v. Smith, 171 F.3d 617, 619-621 (CA8 1999).  According to those courts, § 922(g)(9) does not require that the offense predicate to the defendant's firearm possession conviction have as an element a domestic relationship between offender and victim.  We granted certiorari, 552 U.S. 1279, 128 S. Ct. 1702,170 L. Ed. 2d 512 (2008), to resolve this conflict. 

II 

Section 922(g)(9) makes it "unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence . . . [to] possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition."  Section 921(a)(33)(A) defines "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as follows: "[T]he term 'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that-- "(i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and "(ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or  guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim." (Footnote omitted.)

This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements:  First, a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" must have, "as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon."  Second, it must be "committed by" a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  The question here is whether the language of § 921(a)(33)(A) calls for a further limitation:  Must the statute describing the predicate offense include, as a discrete element, the existence of a domestic relationship between offender and victim?  In line with the large majority of the Courts of Appeals, we conclude  that § 921(a)(33)(A) does not require a predicate-offense statute of that specificity.  Instead, in a § 922(g)(9) prosecution, it suffices for the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, in fact, for "an offense . . . committed by" the defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim. 

We note as an initial matter  that § 921(a)(33)(A) uses the word "element" in the singular, which suggests that Congress intended to describe only one required element.  Immediately following the word "element," § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) refers to the use of force (undoubtedly a required element) and thereafter to the relationship between aggressor and victim, e.g., a current or former spouse.  The manner in which the offender acts, and the offender's relationship with the victim, are "conceptually distinct attributes."  United States v. Meade, 175 F.3d 215, 218 (CA1 1999).4Hayes observes, see Brief for Respondent 24-25, that Congress has used the singular "element" in defining a "crime of violence" to require both an action (the use of force) and its object (the person of another).  See, e.g.,18 U.S.C. § 16(a) (defining "crime of violence" as "an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another").  Although one might conceive of an action and its object as separate elements, it is unsurprising that Congress would have chosen to denominate "the use of force against another" as a single, undifferentiated element.  In contrast, the two requirements set out in § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) --the use of force and the existence of a specified relationship between aggressor and victim--are not readily conceptualized as a single element.  Had Congress meant to make the latter as well as the former an element of the predicate offense, it likely would have used the plural "elements," as it has done in other offense-defining provisions.  See, e.g.,18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(2)(A) ("[T]he term 'assault with intent to commit rape' means an offense that has as its elements engaging in physical contact with another person or using or brandishing a weapon against another person with intent to commit aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse.").  Cf. Black's Law Dictionary 559 (8th ed. 2004) (defining "element" as "[a] constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed").5Invoking the Dictionary Act, Hayes contends that the singular "element" encompasses the plural "elements."  See Brief for Respondent 25.  The Dictionary Act provides  that, "unless the context indicates otherwise," "words importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things."  1 U.S.C. § 1.  On the rare occasions when we have relied on this rule, doing so was "necessary to carry out the evident intent of the statute."  First Nat. Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, 263 U.S. 640, 657, 44 S. Ct. 213, 68 L. Ed. 486 (1924).  As we explain infra, at 426-429, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 828-829, Hayes's reading of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A) does not accord with Congress' aim in extending the gun possession ban.

Treating the relationship between aggressor and victim as an element of the predicate offense is also awkward as a matter of syntax.  It requires the reader to regard "the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon" as an expression modified by the relative clause "committed by."  In ordinary usage, however, we  would not say that a person "commit[s]" a "use."  It is more natural to say that a person "commit[s]" an "offense."  See, e.g., United States v. Belless, 338 F.3d 1063, 1066 (CA9 2003) ("One can 'commit' a crime or an offense, but one does not 'commit' 'force' or 'use.'"). 

In reaching the conclusion that § 921(a)(33)(A) renders both the use of force and a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim necessary elements of a qualifying predicate offense, the Fourth Circuit majority relied on two textual arguments.  First, the court noted that clause (ii) is separated from clause (i) by a line break and a semicolon; in contrast, the components of clause (ii)--force and domestic relationship--are joined in an unbroken word flow.  See 482 F.3d, at 753. 

Had Congress placed the "committed by" phrase in its own clause, set off from clause (ii) by a semicolon or a line break, the lawmakers might have better conveyed that "committed by" modifies only "offense" and not "use" or "element."  Congress' less-than-meticulous drafting, however, hardly shows that the legislators meant to exclude from § 922(g)(9)'s firearm possession prohibition domestic abusers convicted under generic assault or battery provisions. 

  As structured, § 921(a)(33)(A) defines "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" by addressing in clause (i) the meaning of "misdemeanor" and, in turn, in clause (ii), "crime of domestic violence."  Because a "crime of domestic violence" involves both a use of force and a domestic relationship, joining these features together in clause (ii) would make sense even if Congress had no design to confine laws qualifying under § 921(a)(33)(A) to those designating as elements both use of force and domestic relationship between aggressor and victim.  See id., at 761 (Williams, J., dissenting).  See also United States v. Barnes, 353 U.S. App. D.C. 87, 295 F.3d 1354, 1358-1360, 1361 (CADC 2002) ("The fact that the Congress somewhat awkwardly included the 'committed by' phrase in subpart (ii) (instead  of adding a subpart (iii)) is not significant in view of the unnatural reading that would result if 'committed by' were construed to modify 'use of force.'"). 

  A related statutory provision, 25 U.S.C. § 2803(3)(C), indicates that Congress did not ascribe substantive significance to the placement of line breaks and semicolons in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A).  In 2006, Congress amended § 921(a)(33)(A)(i) to include misdemeanors under "[t]ribal law" as predicate offenses.  As a companion measure, Congress simultaneously enacted § 2803(3)(C), which employs use-of-force and domestic-relationship language virtually identical to the language earlier placed in § 921(a)(33)(A)(i), except that § 2803(3)(C) uses no semicolon or line break. 

Section 2803(3)(C) authorizes federal agents to "make an arrest without a warrant for an offense committed in Indian country if-- "the offense is a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence . . . and has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victim . . . ."

  At the time Congress enacted § 2803(3)(C), the Courts of Appeals uniformly agreed that § 921(a)(33)(A) did not limit predicate offenses to statutory texts specifying both a use of force and a domestic relationship as offense elements.  Congress presumably knew how § 921(a)(33)(A) had been construed, and presumably intended § 2803(3)(C) to bear the same meaning.  See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 85-86, 126 S. Ct. 1503, 164 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2006) ("[W]hen 'judicial  interpretations have settled the meaning of an existing statutory provision, repetition of the same language in a new statute indicates, as a general matter, the intent to incorporate its . . . judicial interpretations as well.'" (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 645, 118 S. Ct. 2196, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1998))).  Relying on spacing and punctuation to hem in § 921(a)(33)(A), while reading § 2803(3)(C) to contain no similar limitation, would create a disjunction between these two provisions that Congress could not have intended. 

As a second justification for its construction of § 921(a)(33)(A), the Court of Appeals invoked  the "rule of the last antecedent," under which "a limiting clause or phrase . . . should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows."  Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26, 124 S. Ct. 376, 157 L. Ed. 2d 333 (2003).  The words "committed by" immediately follow the use-of-force language, the court observed, and therefore should be read to modify that phrase, not the earlier word "offense."  See 482 F.3d, at 753-755.  The rule of the last antecedent, however, "is not an absolute and can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning."  Barnhart, 540 U.S., at 26, 124 S. Ct. 376, 157 L. Ed. 2d 333.6As the United States points out, the Court of Appeals "itself recognized the flexibility of the rule [of the last antecedent]."  Brief for United States 20, n 7.  Under a strict application of the rule, the "committed by" phrase would modify only its immediate antecedent, i.e., "the threatened use of a deadly weapon," and not the entire phrase "use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon."  The court rightly regarded such a reading as implausible.  See 482 F.3d 749, 755 (CA4 2007).

Applying the rule of the last antecedent here would require us to accept two unlikely premises:  that Congress employed the singular "element" to encompass two distinct concepts, and that it adopted the awkward construction "commi[t]" a "use."  See supra, at 421-423, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 825-826.  Moreover, as the dissent acknowledges, post, at 433, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 832, the last-antecedent rule  would render the word "committed" superfluous:  Congress could have conveyed the same meaning by referring simply to the "use . . . of [physical] force . . . by a current or former spouse . . . ."  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  "Committed" retains its operative meaning only if it is read to modify "offense." 

  Most sensibly read, then, § 921(a)(33)(A) defines "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" as a misdemeanor offense that (1) "has, as an element, the use [of force]," and (2) is committed by a person who has a specified domestic relationship with the victim.  To obtain a conviction in a § 922(g)(9) prosecution, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim of the predicate offense was the defendant's current or former spouse or was related to the defendant in another specified way.  But that relationship, while it must be established, need not be denominated an element of the predicate offense.7We find it not at all "surprising"--indeed, it seems to us "most natural"--to read § 921(a)(33)(A) to convey that a person convicted of battering a spouse or other domestic victim has committed a "crime of domestic violence," whether or not the statute of conviction happens to contain a domestic-relationship element.  Cf. post, at 431, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 831.

III 

Practical considerations strongly support our reading of § 921(a)(33)(A)'s language.  Existing felon-in-possession laws, Congress recognized, were not keeping firearms out of the hands of domestic abusers, because "many people who engage in serious spousal or child abuse ultimately are not charged with or convicted of felonies."  142 Cong. Rec. 22985 (1996) (statement of Sen. Lautenberg).  By extending the federal firearm prohibition to persons convicted of "misdemeanor crime[s] of domestic violence," proponents of § 922(g)(9) sought to "close this dangerous loophole."  Id., at 22986. 

  Construing § 922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a generic use-of-force statute (one that does not  designate a domestic relationship as an element of the offense) would frustrate Congress' manifest purpose.  Firearms and domestic strife are a potentially deadly combination nationwide.  See, e.g., Brief for Brady Center To Prevent Gun Violence et al. as Amici Curiae 8-15; Brief for National Network To End Domestic Violence et al. as Amici Curiae 2-8.  Yet, as interpreted by the Fourth Circuit, § 922(g)(9) would have been "a dead letter" in some two-thirds of the States from the very moment of its enactment.  482 F.3d, at 762 (Williams, J., dissenting). 

As of 1996, only about one-third of the States had criminal statutes that specifically proscribed domestic violence.  See Brief for United States 23, n 8.8Additional States have enacted such statutes since 1996, but about one-half of the States still prosecute domestic violence exclusively under generally applicable criminal laws.  See Brief for United States 23-24, and n 9.  Even in those States, domestic abusers were (and are) routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or battery laws.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.  And no statute defining a distinct federal misdemeanor designated as an element of the offense a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim.  Yet Congress defined "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" to include "misdemeanor[s] under Federal . . . law."  § 921(a)(33)(A)(i).   Given the paucity of state and federal statutes targeting domestic violence, we find it highly improbable that Congressmeant to extend § 922(g)(9)'s firearm possession ban only to the relatively few domestic abusers prosecuted under laws rendering a domestic relationship an element of the offense.  See Barnes, 295 F.3d, at 1364 (rejecting the view that "Congress remedied one disparity--between felony and misdemeanor domestic violence convictions--while at the same time creating a new disparity among (and sometimes, within) states").9Generally, as in this case, it would entail no "'elaborate factfinding process,'" post, at 436, 172 L. Ed. 2d, at 834, to determine whether the victim of a violent assault was the perpetrator's "current or former spouse" or bore one of the other domestic relationships specified in § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) to the perpetrator.

 The measure that became §§ 922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A), Hayes acknowledges, initially may have had a broadly remedial purpose, see Brief for Respondent 28-29, but the text of the proposal, he maintains, was revised and narrowed while the measure remained in the congressional hopper.  The compromise reflected in the text that gained passage, Hayes argues, restricted the legislation to offenses specifically denominating a domestic relationship as a defining element.  The changes Hayes identifies, however, do not corroborate his argument. 

Congress did revise the language of § 921(a)(33)(A) to spell out the use-of-force requirement.  The proposed legislation initially described the predicate domestic-violence offense as a "crime of violence . . . committed by" a person who had a domestic relationship with the victim.  142 Cong. Rec. 5840.  The final version replaced the unelaborated phrase "crime of violence" with the phrase "has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon."  This apparently last-minute insertion may help to explain some of the syntactical awkwardness of the enacted language, but it does not evince an intention to convert the "committed by" phrase into a required element of the predicate offense. 

Indeed, in a floor statement discussing the revised version of § 922(g)(9), Senator Frank Lautenberg, the sponsor of the provision, observed that a domestic relationship between aggressor and victim often would not be a designated element of the predicate offense: "[C]onvictions for domestic violence-related crimes often are for crimes, such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as related to domestic violence.  Therefore, it will not always be possible for law enforcement authorities to determine from the face of someone's criminal record whether a particular misdemeanor conviction  involves domestic violence, as defined in the new law."  Id., at 26675.

  The remarks of a single Senator are "not controlling," Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 118, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1980), but, as Hayes recognizes, the legislative record is otherwise "absolutely silent."  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 35.  It contains no suggestion that Congress intended to confine § 922(g)(9) to abusers who had violated statutes rendering the domestic relationship between aggressor and victim an element of the offense. 

IV 

The rule of lenity, Hayes contends, provides an additional reason to construe §§ 922(g)(9) and 921(a)(33)(A) to apply only to predicate offenses that specify a domestic relationship as an element of the crime.  "[T]he touchstone of the rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity."  Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S. Ct. 2247, 65 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We apply the rule "only when, after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction, we are left with an ambiguous statute."  United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S. Ct. 382, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1994). Section 921(a)(33)(A)'s definition of "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence," we acknowledge, is not a model of the careful drafter's art.  See Barnes, 295 F.3d, at 1356.  But neither is it "grievous[ly] ambigu[ous]."  Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S. Ct. 1262, 39 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1974).  The text, context, purpose, and what little there is of drafting history all point in the same direction:  Congress defined "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" to include an offense "committed by" a person who had a specified domestic relationship with the victim, whether or not the misdemeanor statute itself designates the domestic relationship as an element of the crime.

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed, and the  case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

We granted certiorari in this case to determine whether Illinois law provides a sufficiently speedy opportunity for an individual, whose car or cash police have seized without a warrant, to contest the lawfulness of the seizure.  See U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1; United States v. Von Neumann, 474 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 610, 88 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1986); United States v. $ 8,850,461 U.S. 555, 103 S. Ct. 2005, 76 L. Ed. 2d 143 (1983).  At the time of oral argument, however, we learned that the underlying property disputes have all ended.  The State has returned all the cars that it seized, and the individual property owners have either forfeited any relevant cash or have accepted as final the State's return of some of it.  We consequently find the case moot, and we therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss.  United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (1950); see also E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice 941-942 (9th ed. 2007). 

I 

Illinois law provides for forfeiture of movable personal property (including cars and cash) used "to facilitate" a drug crime.  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, § 570/505(a)(6) (West 2008).  It permits a police officer to seize that property without a warrant where (1) the officer has "probable cause to believe" the property was so used and (2) a "warrantless seizure . . .  would be reasonable" in the circumstances.  § 570/505(b).  When an officer has seized property without a warrant, the relevant law enforcement agency must notify the State's Attorney within 52 days of the seizure; the State's Attorney must notify the property owner of any impending forfeiture within a further 45 days; and, if the owner wishes to contest forfeiture, the State's Attorney must begin judicial forfeiture proceedings within yet a further 45 days.  See ch. 725, §§ 150/5-150/6.  Thus, the statute gives the State up to 142 days, nearly five months, to begin judicial forfeiture proceedings--during which time the statute permits the State to keep the car or cash within its possession. 

On November 22, 2006, six individuals (the respondents or "plaintiffs") brought this federal civil rights action against defendants the city of Chicago, the Superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, and the Cook County State's Attorney (the petitioner here, whom we shall call the "State's Attorney").  See Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Three of the individuals, Chermane Smith, Edmanuel Perez, and Tyhesha Brunston, said that earlier in 2006 the police had, upon their arrests, seized their cars without a warrant.  See Complaint P 25, App. 34a (Smith, seizure on Jan. 19, 2006); id., P 26, at 34a (Perez, seizure on Mar. 8, 2006); id., P 27, at 34a (Brunston, seizure on Apr. 8, 2006); Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification P 8, at 39a.  The other three plaintiffs, Michelle Waldo, Kirk Yunker, and Tony Williams, said that earlier in 2006 police had, upon their arrests, seized their cash without a warrant.  See Complaint P 28, at 34a-35a (Waldo, seizure on Jan. 20, 2006); id., P 29, at 35a (Yunker, seizure on Sept. 26, 2006); id., P 30, at 35a (Williams, seizure in July 2006); Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification P 8, at 39a.  The plaintiffs added that the police department still had custody of their property.  See Complaint PP 24-30, at 34a-35a.  They claimed that the failure of the State to provide a speedy postseizure hearing violated the federal Due Process Clause.  See U.S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1.  And  they asked the court (1) to certify the case as a class action, (2) to declare that they had a due process right to a prompt postseizure probable-cause hearing, (3) to declare that the hearing must take place within 10 days of any seizure, and (4) to enjoin the defendants' current practice of keeping the property in custody for a longer time without a judicial determination of probable cause.  See Complaint P 36, App. 36a. 

The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that Seventh Circuit precedent made clear that "the Constitution does not require any procedure prior to the actual forfeiture proceeding."  Jones v. Takaki, 38 F.3d 321, 324 (1994) (citing Von Neumann, supra, at 249, 106 S. Ct. 610, 88 L. Ed. 2d 587).  On February 22, 2007, the District Court granted the motion to dismiss.  It also denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.  The plaintiffs appealed. 

On May 2, 2008, the Seventh Circuit decided the appeal in the plaintiffs' favor. Smith v. Chicago, 524 F.3d 834.  It reconsidered and departed from its earlier precedent. Id., at 836-839.  It held that "the procedures set out in" the Illinois statute "show insufficient concern for the due process right of the plaintiffs."  Id., at 838.  And it added that, "given the length of time which can result between the seizure of property and the opportunity for an owner to contest the seizure under" Illinois law, "some sort of mechanism to test the validity of the retention of the property is required."  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case for further proceedings.  Id., at 839.  Its mandate issued about seven weeks thereafter. 

On February 23, 2009, we granted certiorari to review the Seventh Circuit's "due process" determination.  The Court of Appeals had already recalled its mandate.  The parties filed briefs in this Court.  We then recognized that the case might be moot, and we asked the parties to address the question of mootness at the forthcoming oral argument. 

 At oral argument counsel for both sides confirmed that there was no longer any dispute about ownership or possession of the relevant property.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (State's Attorney); id., at 56-57 (plaintiffs).  The State had returned the cars to plaintiffs Smith, Perez, and Brunston.  See id., at 5.  Two of the plaintiffs had "defaulted," apparently conceding that the State could keep the cash.  Ibid.  And the final plaintiff and the State's Attorney agreed that the plaintiff could keep some, but not all, of the cash at issue.  Id., at 5, 56-57.  As counsel for the State's Attorney told us, "[T]hose cases are over."  Id., at 5. 

II 

  The Constitution permits this Court to decide legal questions only in the context of actual "Cases" or "Controversies."  U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2.  An "'actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.'"  Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401, 95 S. Ct. 2330, 45 L. Ed. 2d 272 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U.S. 452, 459, n. 10, 94 S. Ct. 1209, 39 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1974)).  In this case there is no longer any actual controversy between the parties about ownership or possession of the underlying property. 

The State's Attorney argues that there is a continuing controversy over damages.  We concede that the plaintiffs filed a motion in the District Court seeking damages.  But the plaintiffs filed their motion after the Seventh Circuit issued its opinion.  And, after this Court granted certiorari, the Court of Appeals recalled its mandate, taking the case away from the District Court before the District Court could respond to the motion.  Thus, we have before us a complaint that seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, not damages. 

The plaintiffs point out that they sought certification of a class.  And a class might well contain members who continue to dispute ownership of seized property.  But that fact is beside the point. The District Court denied the plaintiffs'  class certification motion.  The plaintiffs did not appeal that denial.  Hence the only disputes relevant here are those between these six plaintiffs and the State's Attorney; those disputes concerned cars and cash; and those disputes are now over.  United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 404, 100 S. Ct. 1202, 63 L. Ed. 2d 479 (1980) ("A named plaintiff whose claim expires may not continue to press the appeal on the merits until a class has been properly certified"). 

The parties, of course, continue to dispute the lawfulness of the State's hearing procedures.  But that dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the plaintiffs' particular legal rights.  Rather, it is an abstract dispute about the law, unlikely to affect these plaintiffs any more than it affects other Illinois citizens.  And  a dispute solely about the meaning of a law, abstracted from any concrete actual or threatened harm, falls outside the scope of the constitutional words "Cases" and "Controversies."  See, e.g., Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477, 110 S. Ct. 1249, 108 L. Ed. 2d 400 (1990); North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 246, 92 S. Ct. 402, 30 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1971)(per curiam); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 241, 57 S. Ct. 461, 81 L. Ed. 617 (1937); Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653, 16 S. Ct. 132, 40 L. Ed. 293 (1895). 

We can find no special circumstance here that might warrant our continuing to hear the case.  We have sometimes heard attacks on practices that no longer directly affect the attacking party, but are "capable of repetition" while "evading review."  See, e.g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 462, 127 S. Ct. 2652, 168 L. Ed. 2d 329 (2007); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S. Ct. 279, 55 L. Ed. 310 (1911).  Yet here, unlike those cases, nothing suggests that the individual plaintiffs will likely again prove subject to the State's seizure procedures.  See Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 109, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983) ("[T]he capable-of-repetition doctrine applies only in exceptional situations, and generally only where the named plaintiff can make a reasonable showing that he will again be subjected to the alleged illegality"); DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 318-319, 94 S. Ct. 1704, 40 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1974)(per curiam).And in any  event, since those who are directly affected by the forfeiture practices might bring damages actions, the practices do not "evade review."  See Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. v. Craft, 436 U.S. 1, 8-9, 98 S. Ct. 1554, 56 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1978) (damages claim saves case from mootness).  Consequently, the case is moot.  See, e.g., Preiser, supra, at 403-404, 95 S. Ct. 2330, 45 L. Ed. 2d 272; Mills, supra, at 658, 16 S. Ct. 132, 40 L. Ed. 293. 

III 

It is less easy to say whether we should order the judgment below vacated.   The statute that enables us to vacate a lower court judgment when a case becomes moot is flexible, allowing a court to "direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances."  28 U.S.C. § 2106; see also U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall Pshp., 513 U.S. 18, 21, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1994).  Applying this statute, we normally do vacate the lower court judgment in a moot case because doing so "clears the path for future relitigation of the issues between the parties," preserving "the rights of all parties," while prejudicing none "by a decision which . . . was only preliminary."  Munsingwear,340 U.S., at 40, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36. 

In Bancorp, however, we described circumstances where we would not do so.  We said that,  "[w]here mootness results from settlement" rather than "'happenstance,'" the "losing party has voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy . . . [and] thereby surrender[ed] his claim to the equitable remedy of vacatur."  513 U.S., at 25, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233.  The plaintiffs, pointing out that the State's Attorney agreed to return all three cars and some of the cash, claim that, with respect to at least four of the plaintiffs, this case falls within Bancorp's "settlement" exception. 

In our view, however, this case more closely resembles mootness through "happenstance" than through "settlement"--at least the kind of settlement that the Court considered in Bancorp. Bancorp focused upon a bankruptcy-related  dispute that involved a legal question whether a bankruptcy court could lawfully confirm a debtor's Chapter 11 reorganization plan if the plan relied upon what the debtor said was a special exception (called the "new value exception") to ordinary creditor priority rules. Id., at 19-20, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233.  The parties contested that legal issue in the Bankruptcy Court; they contested it in an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's order to the Federal District Court; they contested it in a further appeal to the Court of Appeals; and eventually they contested it in this Court. Id., at 20, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233.  While the case was pending here, the parties settled their differences in the Bankruptcy Court (the court where the case originated)--including their differences on this particular contested legal point.  Ibid.  They agreed upon a reorganization plan, which they said would constitute a settlement that mooted the federal case.  Ibid.

Recognizing that the reorganization plan that the Bankruptcy Judge confirmed in the case amounted to a settlement that mooted the case, this Court did not vacate the lower court's judgment.  The Court's reason for leaving the lower court's judgment in place was that mootness was not a result of "the vagaries of circumstance."  Id., at 25, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233.  Rather the party seeking review had "caused the mootness by voluntary action."  Id., at 24, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233 (emphasis added).  By virtue of the settlement, that party had "voluntarily forfeited his legal remedy by the ordinary processes of appeal or certiorari."  Id., at 25, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233.  Hence, compared to mootness caused by "happenstance," considerations of "equity" and "fairness" tilted against vacatur.  Id., at 25-26, 115 S. Ct. 386, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233. 

Applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that the terminations here fall on the "happenstance" side of the line.  The six individual cases proceeded through a different court system without any procedural link to the federal case before us.  To our knowledge (and we have examined the state-court docket sheets), no one in those cases raised the procedural question at issue here.  Rather, the  issues in those six cases were issues solely of state substantive law:  Were the cars and the cash forfeitable or not?  And court docket sheets suggest that the six state cases terminated on substantive grounds in the ordinary course of such state proceedings.  In the three automobile cases, the State voluntarily dismissed the proceedings and returned the cars between 11 and 40 months after the seizures, a long enough time for the State to have investigated the matters and to have determined (after the termination of any related criminal proceedings) for evidentiary reasons that it did not wish to claim the cars.  See Dockets in People v. 2004 Chevrolet Impala, No. 2006-COFO-000296 (Cook County, IL) (Brunston's car returned on July 27, 2009); People v. Smith, No. 2006-COFO-000036 (Cook County, IL) (Smith's car returned on May 5, 2008); and People v. 1999 Chevrolet Malibu, No. 2006-COFO-000288 (Cook County, IL) (Perez's car returned on Jan. 29, 2007).  In the remaining contested case, involving cash, the State voluntarily dismissed the proceedings after 14 months, again a long enough time for the State to have weighed the evidence and found a compromise settlement appropriate on the merits.  See Docket in People v. $1,500 in U. S. Currency, No. 2006-COFO-000201 (Cook County, IL) (Waldo's cash returned on Mar. 19, 2007).  The disparate dates at which the plaintiffs' forfeiture proceedings terminated--11, 14, 27, and 40 months after the seizures--indicate that the State's Attorney did not coordinate the resolution of the plaintiffs' state-court cases, either with each other or with the plaintiffs' federal civil rights case.  Cf. Munsingwear, 340 U.S., at 39-40, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36 (stating that a lower court judgment would have been vacated even though an action of the party seeking review had brought about the mootness because that action--a commodity being decontrolled by Executive Order--was basically unrelated); see also Fleming v. Munsingwear, Inc., 162 F.2d 125, 127 (CA8 1947). 

For these reasons, we believe that the presence of this federal case played no significant role in the termination of  the separate state-court proceedings.  This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that neither party, although aware of Bancorp, suggested the contrary at oral argument.  Indeed, both parties argued against mootness at oral argument, a fact that further suggests that a desire to avoid review in this case played no role at all in producing the state case terminations.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-11, 33-38.  And if the presence of this federal case played no role in causing the termination of those state cases, there is not present here the kind of "voluntary forfeit[ure]" of a legal remedy that led the Court in Bancorp to find that considerations of "fairness" and "equity" tilted against vacatur. 

We consequently conclude that we should follow our ordinary practice, thereby "clear[ing] the path for future relitigation of the issues."  Munsingwear, 340 U.S., at 40, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36.  Thus, nothing in this opinion prevents the plaintiffs from bringing a claim for damages based on the conduct alleged in their complaint.  Id., at 37-40, 71 S. Ct. 104, 95 L. Ed. 36. 

We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

"It is most true that this Court will not take jurisdiction if it should not," Chief Justice Marshall famously wrote, "but it is equally true, that it must take jurisdiction if it should. . . .  We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given."  Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 6 Wheat. 264, 404, 5 L. Ed. 257 (1821); see Marshall v. Marshall, 547 U.S. 293, 298-299, 126 S. Ct. 1735, 164 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2006).  While Chief Justice Marshall's statement bears "fine tuning," there is surely a starting presumption that  when jurisdiction is conferred, a court may not decline to exercise it.  See R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 1061-1062 (6th ed. 2009).  The general rule applicable to courts also holds for administrative agencies directed by Congress to adjudicate particular controversies. 

Congress vested in the National Railroad Adjustment Board (hereinafter NRAB or Board) jurisdiction to adjudicate grievances of railroad employees that remain unsettled after pursuit of internal procedures.  45 U.S.C. § 153 First (h), (i).  We consider in this case five nearly identical decisions of a panel of the NRAB dismissing employee claims "for lack of jurisdiction."  NRAB First Div. Award No. 26089 etc. (Mar. 15, 2005), App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a-107a, 69a (hereinafter Panel Decision).  In each case, the panel declared that a procedural rule raised by a panel member, unprompted by the parties, was "jurisdictional" in character and therefore commanded threshold dismissal. 

The panel's characterization, we hold, was misconceived.  Congress authorized the Board to prescribe rules for the presentation and processing of claims, § 153 First (v), but Congress alone controls the Board's jurisdiction.  By presuming authority to declare procedural rules "jurisdictional," the panel failed "to conform, or confine itself, to matters [Congress placed] within the scope of [NRAB] jurisdiction," § 153 First (q).  Because the panel was not "without authority to assume jurisdiction over the [employees'] claim[s]," Panel Decision 72a, its dismissals lacked tenable grounding.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit setting aside the panel's orders.

Concerned that labor disputes would lead to strikes bringing railroads to a halt, Congress enacted the Railway Labor Act (RLA or Act), 44 Stat. 577, as amended, 45 U.S.C. § 151 et seq., in 1926 to promote peaceful and efficient resolution of those disputes.  See Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U.S. 601, 609, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460 (1959); § 151a.   The Act instructs labor and industry "to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions, and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption to commerce or to the operation of any carrier . . . ."  § 152 First; see Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U.S. 369, 377-378, 89 S. Ct. 1109, 22 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1969) (describing obligation to pursue agreement as the "heart of the [RLA]").  As part of its endeavor, Congress provided a framework for the settlement and voluntary arbitration of "minor disputes."  See Price, 360 U.S., at 609-610, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460.  (In the railroad industry, the term "minor disputes" means, primarily, "grievances arising from the application of collective bargaining agreements to particular situations."  Id., at 609, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460.)1In contrast to minor disputes, which assume "the existence of a collective agreement," major disputes are those "over the formation of collective agreements or efforts to secure them.  . . .  They look to the acquisition of rights for the future, not to assertion of rights claimed to have vested in the past."  Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U.S. 711, 723, 65 S. Ct. 1282, 89 L. Ed. 1886 (1945).

Many railroads, however, resisted voluntary arbitration.  See id., at 610, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460. Congress therefore amended the Act in 1934 (1934 Amendment) to mandate arbitration of minor disputes; under the altered scheme, arbitration occurs before panels composed of two representatives of labor and two of industry, with a neutral referee serving as tiebreaker.  See id., at 610-613, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460.  To supply the representative arbitrators, Congress established the NRAB, a board of 34 private persons representing labor and industry in equal numbers.  § 153 First (a); see Trainmen v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 353 U.S. 30, 36-37, 77 S. Ct. 635, 1 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1957).2The RLA divides the NRAB into four divisions, each covering specified classes of railroad employees.  § 153 First (h).  Neutral referees, the RLA provides, shall be appointed by the representative arbitrators or, failing their agreement, by the National Mediation Board.  § 153 First (l).  The 1934 Amendment authorized the NRAB to adopt, at a one-time session in 1934, "such rules as it deems necessary to control proceedings," § 153 First (v); the product of that rulemaking, codified at 29 CFR pt. 301 (2009), is known as Circular One. 

In keeping with Congress' aim to promote peaceful settlement of minor disputes,  the RLA requires employees and carriers, before resorting to arbitration, to exhaust the grievance procedures specified in the collective-bargaining agreement (hereinafter CBA).  See 45 U.S.C. § 153 First (i).  This stage of the dispute-resolution process is known as "on-property" proceedings.  As a final prearbitration step, the Act directs parties to attempt settlement "in conference" between designated representatives of the carrier and the grievant-employee.  § 152 Second,Sixth.3Central to the instant controversy, § 152 Second, Sixth read, in full: "Second.  Consideration of disputes by representatives. All disputes between a carrier or carriers and its or their employees shall be considered, and, if possible, decided, with all expedition, in conference between representatives designated and authorized so to confer, respectively, by the carrier or carriers and by the employees thereof interested in the dispute." "Sixth.  Conference of representatives; time; place; private agreements. "In case of a dispute between a carrier or carriers and its or their employees, arising out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, it shall be the duty of the designated representative or representatives of such carrier or carriers and of such employees, within ten days after the receipt of notice of a desire on the part of either party to confer in respect to such dispute, to specify a time and place at which such conference shall be held:  Provided, (1) That the place so specified shall be situated upon the line of the carrier involved or as otherwise mutually agreed upon; and (2) that the time so specified shall allow the designated conferees reasonable opportunity to reach such place of conference, but shall not exceed twenty days from the receipt of such notice:  And provided further, That nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to conferences) then in effect between the parties."  The RLA contains instructions concerning the place and time of conferences, but specifies that the statute does not "supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties," § 152 Sixth; it is undisputed that in common practice the conference may be as informal as a telephone conversation. 

  If the parties fail to achieve resolution "in the usual manner up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle [minor] disputes," either party may refer the matter to the NRAB.  § 153 First (i).  Submissions to the Board must include "a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes."  Ibid.; see 29 CFR § 301.5(d), (e) (submissions "must clearly and briefly set forth all relevant, argumentative facts, including all documentary evidence").  Arbitration is launched when the party referring the dispute files a notice of intent with the NRAB; after Board acknowledgment of the notice, the parties have 75 days to file simultaneous submissions.  NRAB, Uniform Rules of Procedure (rev. June 23, 2003). 

  In creating the scheme of mandatory arbitration superintended by the NRAB, the 1934 Amendment largely "foreclose[d] litigation" over minor disputes. Price, 360 U.S., at 616, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460; see Railway Conductors v. Pitney, 326 U.S. 561, 566, 66 S. Ct. 322, 90 L. Ed. 318 (1946) ("Not only has Congress . . . designated an agency peculiarly competent to handle [minor disputes], but . . . it also intended to leave a minimum responsibility to the courts."). Congress did provide that an employee who obtained a monetary award against a carrier could sue to enforce it, and the court could either enforce the award or set it aside. Price, 360 U.S., at 616, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460; 45 U.S.C. § 153 First (p) (1934 ed.).  In addition to that limited role, some Courts of Appeals, we noted in Price, reviewed awards "claimed to result from a denial of due process of law."  360 U.S., at 616, 79 S. Ct. 1351, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1460 (citing Ellerd v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 241 F.2d 541 (CA7 1957); Barnett v. Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines, 245 F.2d 579, 582 (CA3 1957)). 

In 1966, Congress again amended the scheme, this time to state grounds on which both employees and railroads could seek judicial review of NRAB orders.  The governing provision, still in force, allows  parties aggrieved by an NRAB panel order to petition for court review.  45 U.S.C. § 153 First (q) (2006 ed.).  The provision instructs that   "[o]n such review, the findings and order of the division shall be conclusive on the parties, except that the order . . . may be set aside, in whole or in part, or remanded . . ., for failure of the division to comply with the requirements of [the RLA], for failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division's jurisdiction, or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order."

Courts of Appeals have divided on whether this provision precludes judicial review of NRAB proceedings for due process violations.  Compare, e.g., Shafii v. PLC British Airways, 22 F.3d 59, 64 (CA2 1994) (review available), and Edelman v. Western Airlines, Inc., 892 F.2d 839, 847 (CA9 1989) (same), with Kinross v. Utah R.  Co., 362 F.3d 658, 662 (CA10 2004) (review precluded).4The disagreement stems from this Court's per curiam opinion in Union Pacific R. Co. v. Sheehan, 439 U.S. 89, 99 S. Ct. 399, 58 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1978).  That case involved an NRAB decision turning on a time limitation contained in the governing CBA.  Based on that limitation, the Board dismissed an employee's claim.  The Tenth Circuit remanded the case to the NRAB on the ground that the Board had failed to consider the employee's equitable tolling argument and thereby violated due process.  We summarily reversed, observing that the Board had in fact considered the plea for equitable tolling and explicitly rejected it.  Id., at 92, 99 S. Ct. 399, 58 L. Ed. 2d 354.  We added that if the Court of Appeals "intended to reverse the [NRAB's] rejection of [the employee's] equitable tolling argument," then the court had exceeded the bounds § 153 First (q) placed on its review authority.  Id., at 93, 99 S. Ct. 399, 58 L. Ed. 2d 354.  In determining whether the CBA's time limitation was tolled, we said, the Board "certainly was acting within its jurisdiction and in conformity with . . . the Act."  Ibid.

 B 

The instant matter arose when petitioner Union Pacific Railroad Co. (hereinafter Carrier) charged five of its employees with disciplinary violations.  Their union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (hereinafter Union), initiated grievance proceedings pursuant to the CBA.  The Union asserts that, following exhaustion of grievance proceedings, the parties conferenced all the disputes; counsel for the Carrier conceded at argument that at least two of the disputes were conferenced, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  Dissatisfied with the outcome of the on-property proceedings, the Union sought arbitration before the First Division of the NRAB.  The Union and the Carrier, from early 2002 through 2003, filed simultaneous submissions in the five cases.  In each submission, the Union included the notice of discipline (or discharge), the hearing transcript, and all exhibits and evidence relating to the underlying adverse actions used in the grievance proceeding.  Neither party mentioned conferencing as a disputed matter.  Yet, in each case, both parties necessarily knew whether the Union and the Carrier had conferred, and the Board's governing rule instructs carriers and employees to "set forth all relevant, argumentative facts," 29 CFR § 301.5(d), (e). 

On March 18, 2004, just prior to the hearing on the employees' claims, one of the industry representatives on the arbitration panel raised an objection.  Petition to Review and Vacate Awards and Orders of First Div. NRAB in No. 05-civ-2401 (ND Ill.), P 20 (hereinafter Pet. to Review).  On his own initiative, unprompted by the Carrier, and in executive session, the industry representative asserted that the on-property record included no proof of conferencing.  See ibid.  The Carrier thereafter embraced the panel member's objection.  The neutral referee informed the Union of the issue and adjourned the hearing, allowing the Union "to submit evidence that conferencing had in fact occurred."  See id., PP 21-23.  The Union did so, offering phone logs, handwritten notes, and correspondence between the parties as evidence of conferencing in each of the five cases.  E.g., Panel Decision 67a-68a.  From its first notice of the objection, however, the Union maintained that the proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, indeed forfeited, as the Carrier itself had not objected prior to the date set for argument of the cases.  E.g., id., at 67a; Pet. to Review PP 22, 29, 30, 54. 

On March 15, 2005, nearly one year after the question of conferencing first arose, the panel, in five identical decisions, dismissed the petitions for want of "authority to assume jurisdiction over the claim[s]."  Panel Decision 72a.  Citing Circular One, see supra, at 73, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438, and "the weight of arbitral precedent," the panel stated that "the evidentiary record" must be deemed "closed once a Notice of Intent has been filed with the NRAB . . . ."  Panel Decision 71a.5The panel observed, however, that the records and notes offered by the Union, "on their face, may be regarded as supportive of its position that the conference[s] occurred."  Panel Decision 69a.  In explaining why the record could not be supplemented to meet the no-proof-of-conferencing objection, the panel emphasized that it was "an appellate tribunal, as opposed to one which is empowered to consider and rule on de novo evidence and arguments."  Id., at 69a. 

The two labor representatives dissented.  The Carrier's submissions, they reasoned, took no exception based on failure to conference or to prove conferencing; therefore, they concluded, under a "well settled principle governing the Board's deliberations," the Carrier had forfeited the issue.  Id., at 105a-106a.  The dissenters urged that the Union had furnished evidence showing "the cases had all been conferenced, even though the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement [did] not require [conferencing]."  Id., at 105a.  Dismissal of the claims, the dissenters charged, demonstrated "the kind of gamesmanship that breeds contempt for the minor dispute process."  Id., at 107a. 

The Union filed a petition for review in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, asking the court to set aside the Board's orders on the ground that the panel had "unlawfully held [it lacked] authority to assume jurisdiction over [the] cases [absent] evidence of a 'conference' between the parties in the . . . 'on-property' record."  Pet. to Review P 1.  Nothing in the Act or the NRAB's procedural rules, the Union maintained, mandated dismissal for failure to allege and prove conferencing in the Union's original submission.  Id., PP 3, 4.  By imposing, without warrant, "a technical pleading or evidentiary requirement" and elevating it to jurisdictional status, the Union charged, the panel had "egregiously violate[d] the Act," id., P 3, or "fail[ed] to conform its jurisdiction to that required by . . . law," id., P 4.  Alternatively, the Union asserted that the panel violated procedural due process by entertaining the Carrier's untimely objection, even though "the Carrier had failed to raise any objection as to lack of conferencing" in its submissions.  Id., P 5. 

The District Court affirmed the Board's orders.  Addressing the Union's argument that the no-proof-of-conferencing issue was untimely raised, the court accepted the panel's description of the issue as "jurisdictional," and noted the familiar proposition that jurisdictional challenges may be raised at any stage of the proceedings.  432 F. Supp. 2d 768, 777, and n. 7 (2006). 

On appeal, the Seventh Circuit recognized that the Union had presented its case "through both a statutory and constitutional framework."  522 F.3d 746, 750 (2008).  The court observed, however, that "the essence of the conflict boils down to a single question:  Is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the NRAB?" Ibid.  It then determined that there was no such prerequisite:  "[N]o statute, regulation, or CBA," the court concluded, "required the evidence [of conferencing] to be presented in the on-property record."  Id., at 757-758.  But instead of resting its decision on the Union's primary, statute-based argument--that the panel erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases--the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the NRAB's proceedings were incompatible with due process.  See id., at 750. 

II 

We granted the Carrier's petition for certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1315, 173 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2009), which asked us to determine whether a reviewing court may set aside NRAB orders for failure to comply with due process notwithstanding the limited grounds for review specified in § 153 First (q).6Quotedsupra, at 75, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 439, those grounds are "failure of the division to comply with [RLA] requirements," "failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of the division's jurisdiction," and "fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the order."  As earlier recounted, Courts of Appeals have divided on this issue.  See supra, at 75, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 440, and n 4.  Appearing as respondent in this Court, however, the Union urged affirmance of the Seventh Circuit's judgment on an alternative ground.  Reasserting the lead argument it had advanced in its petition for court review, see supra, at 78, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 441, the Union maintained that the Board did not "conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction," § 153 First (q).  Brief for Respondent 52-53.  In response, the Carrier stated that the Union's alternative ground "presents a pure question of law that th[e] Court can and should resolve without need for remand."  Reply Brief 24, n 9.  We agree. 

  So long as a respondent does not "seek to modify the judgment below," true here, "[i]t is well accepted" that the respondent may, "without filing a cross-appeal or cross-petition, . . . rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment."  Blum v. Bacon, 457 U.S. 132, 137, n. 5, 102 S. Ct. 2355, 72 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1982).  The Seventh Circuit, as just observed, see supra, at 78-79, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 441-442, understood that the Union had pressed "statutory and constitutional" arguments, but also comprehended that both arguments homed in on "a single question:  is written documentation of the conference in the on-property record a necessary prerequisite to arbitration before the NRAB?" 522 F.3d, at 750.  Answering this "single question" in the negative, the Court of Appeals effectively resolved the Union's core complaint.  But, for reasons far from apparent, the court declared that "once we answer the key question . . ., adjudication of the due process claim is unavoidable."  Ibid.

The Seventh Circuit, we agree, asked the right question, but inappropriately placed its answer under a constitutional, rather than a statutory, headline.  As the Court of Appeals determined, and as we discuss infra, at 81-86, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 443-447,  nothing in the Act elevates to jurisdictional status the obligation to conference minor disputes or to prove conferencing.  That being so, the "unavoidable" conclusion, following from the Seventh Circuit's "answer [to] the key question," 522 F.3d, at 750, is that the panel, in § 153 First (q)'s words, failed "to conform, or confine itself, to matters within the scope of [its] jurisdiction."  The Carrier, although it sought a different outcome, was quite right to "urg[e] [the Court of Appeals] to consider the statutory claim before the constitutional one."  522 F.3d, at 750. 

In short, a negative answer to the "single question" identified by the Court of Appeals leaves no doubt about the Union's entitlement, in accord with § 153 First (q), to vacation of the Board's orders.  Given this statutory ground for relief, there is no due process issue alive in this case, and no warrant to answer a question that may be consequential in another case:  Absent grounds specified in § 153 First (q) for vacating a Board order, may a reviewing court set aside an NRAB adjudication for incompatibility with due process?  An answer to that question must await a case in which the issue is genuinely in controversy.7A case of that order would be uncommon.  As the Carrier acknowledges, "many of the cases reviewing ostensibly extra-statutory due process objections could have been accommodated within the statutory framework."  Brief for Petitioner 36.  See also id., at 37 ("The statutory review provisions are plainly generous enough to permit litigants to raise all of the simple, common, easily adjudicated, and likely to be meritorious claims that sail under the flag of due process of law . . . .").  In this case, however, our grant of certiorari enables us to address a matter of some importance:  We can reduce confusion, clouding court as well as Board decisions, over matters properly typed "jurisdictional." 

III 

A 

Recognizing that the word "jurisdiction" has been used by courts, including this Court, to convey "many, too many, meanings," Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 90, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), we have cautioned, in recent decisions, against profligate use of the term.   Not all mandatory "prescriptions, however emphatic, are . . . properly typed jurisdictional," we explained in Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 510, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Subject-matter jurisdiction properly comprehended, we emphasized, refers to a tribunal's "power to hear a case," a matter that "can never be forfeited or waived."  Id., at 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 152 L. Ed. 2d 860 (2002)).  In contrast, a "claim-processing rule, . . . even if unalterable on a party's application," does not reduce the adjudicatory domain of a tribunal and is ordinarily "forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point."  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004). 

For example, we have held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., requiring complainants to file a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) before proceeding to court. Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982).  We have also held nonjurisdictional and forfeitable the Title VII provision exempting employers who engage fewer than 15 employees. Arbaugh, 546 U.S., at 503, 515-516,  126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097.  And we have determined that a Chapter 7 trustee's (or creditor's) limited time to object to the debtor's discharge, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004, is a claim-processing, not a jurisdictional, matter. Kontrick, 540 U.S., at 446-447, 460, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867. In contrast, relying on a long line of this Court's decisions left undisturbed by Congress, we have reaffirmed the jurisdictional character of the time limitation for filing a notice of appeal stated in 28 U.S.C. § 2107(a).  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 209-211, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007).  See also John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 132, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008) (court must consider sua sponte timeliness of lawsuit filed against the United States in the Court of Federal Claims). 

With these decisions in mind, we turn back to  the requirement that parties to minor disputes, as a last chance prearbitration, attempt settlement "in conference," 45 U.S.C. § 152 Second, Sixth.  See supra, at 73-74, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 438-439, and n 3.  This obligation is imposed on carriers and grievants alike but, we hold, its satisfaction does not condition the adjudicatory authority of the Board. 

  The Board's jurisdiction extends to "all disputes between carriers and their employees 'growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, or working conditions . . . .'"Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W. R. Co., 339 U.S. 239, 240, 70 S. Ct. 577, 94 L. Ed. 795 (1950) (quoting § 153 First (i)).  True, the RLA instructs that, before any reference to arbitration, the dispute "shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the [designated] chief operating officer."  § 153 First (i).  And when the CBA's grievance procedure has not been followed, resort to the Board would ordinarily be objectionable as premature. 

The additional requirement of a conference, we note, is independent of the CBA process.  Rather, the conference requirement is stated in the "[g]eneral duties" section of the RLA, § 152, a section that is not moored to the "[e]stablishment[,] . . . powers[,] and duties" of the NRAB set out next in § 153 First.  Rooted in § 152 and often informal in practice, see supra, at 73-74, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 438-439, conferencing is surely no more "jurisdictional" than is the presuit resort to the EEOC held forfeitable in Zipes, 455 U.S., at 393, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234.8 The RLA states, in § 152 First, a general duty "to settle all disputes," and, in § 152 Second, a more specific duty to "conference."  These provisions apply to all disputes in the railroad industry, major as well as minor.  They also apply to disputes in the airline industry, over which the NRAB has no jurisdiction.  § 181.  Neither provision "speak[s] in jurisdictional terms or refer[s] in any way to the jurisdiction of the" NRAB.  Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, at 394, 102 S. Ct. 1127, 71 L. Ed. 2d 234 (1982).  And if the requirement to conference is not "jurisdictional," then failure initially to submit proof of conferencing cannot be of that genre.  See Part III-B, infra.

In defense of the Board's characterization of conferencing and proof thereof as jurisdictional, the Carrier points to the NRAB's Circular One procedural regulations, see supra, at 73, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438, which provide:   "No petition shall be considered by any division of the Board unless the subject matter has been handled in accordance with the provisions of the [RLA]."  29 CFR § 301.2(b).  But  that provision, as other prescriptions in Circular One, is a claim-processing rule.  Congress gave the Board no authority to adopt rules of jurisdictional dimension.  See 45 U.S.C. § 153 First (v) (authorizing the NRAB to "adopt such rules as it deems necessary to control proceedings before the respective divisions and not in conflict with the provisions of this section").  And when the fact of conferencing is genuinely contested, we see no reason why the panel could not adjourn the proceeding pending cure of any lapse.  Circular One does not exclude such a sensible solution. 

The Carrier cites NRAB decisions that allegedly support characterization of conferencing as jurisdictional.  If the NRAB lacks authority to define the jurisdiction of its panels, however, surely the panels themselves lack that authority.  Furthermore, NRAB panels have variously addressed the matter.  For example, in NRAB Third Div. Award No. 15880 (Oct. 26, 1967), the panel, although characterizing the conferencing requirement as "jurisdictional," said that "[i]f one of the parties refuses or fails to avail itself of a conference where there is an opportunity to do so, it cannot then assert the defense of a lack of jurisdiction."  Id., at 2.  See also NRAB Fourth Div. Award No. 5074 (June 21, 2001) (same); NRAB Third Div. Award No. 28147 (Oct. 16, 1989) (same).  Cf. Arbaugh, 546 U.S., at 511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 ("unrefined" uses of the word "jurisdiction" are entitled to "no precedential effect" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And in NRAB First Div. Award No. 23867, p 5 (Apr. 7, 1988), the panel observed that the ordinary remedy for lack of conferencing is to "dismiss th[e] claim without prejudice to allow Claimant to cure the jurisdictional defect."  That panel reached the merits nevertheless.  Ibid.  Cf. Steel Co., 523 U.S., at 94, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 ("Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the [tribunal] is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.)" (quoting Ex parte McCardle, 74 U.S. 506, 7 Wall. 506, 514, 19 L. Ed. 264 (1869))).  We note, in addition, the acknowledgment of the Carrier's counsel that, if conferencing has not occurred, NRAB panels have stayed arbitration to allow the parties to confer.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 10, 22.9While holding that the panel did not lack jurisdiction over the employees' claims, we recognize the Board's authority to adopt claim-processing rules backed by effective sanctions.  See supra, at 73, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438; cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 37(b)(2) (specifying sanctions, including dismissal, for failure to comply with discovery orders); Rule 41(b) (authorizing involuntary dismissal for failure to prosecute or to comply with rules of procedure or court orders).  We also recognize that NRAB panels, in managing individual arbitrations, may prescribe and enforce reasonable procedural requirements.

  The RLA provides that, when on-property proceedings do not yield settlement, both parties or either party may refer the case to the Board "with a full statement of the facts and all supporting data bearing upon the disputes."  § 153 First (i).  Circular One correspondingly instructs employees seeking Board adjudication "[to] set forth all relevant, argumentative facts" and "affirmatively show the same to have been presented to the carrier and made a part of the particular question in dispute."  29 CFR § 301.5(d);  see § 301.5(e) (similar instruction addressed to carriers).  Conferencing, the Carrier urged, is a "relevant, argumentative fac[t]," so proof thereof must accompany party submissions. 

As earlier explained, see supra, at 83-84, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 444-445, instructions on party submissions--essentially pleading instructions--are claim-processing, not jurisdictional, rules.  Moreover, the Board itself has recognized that conferencing may not be a "question in dispute."  It has counseled parties submitting joint exhibits "to omit documents that are unimportant and/or irrelevant to the disposition of the [case]; for example . . . letters requesting a conference (assuming that is not an issue in the dispute)."  NRAB Instructions Sheet, Joint Exh. Program, p 5 (July 1, 2003), online at http://www.nmb.gov/arbitration/nrabinstruc.pdf (as visited Dec. 3, 2009, and in Clerk of Court's case file).  It bears repetition here that neither the Union nor the Carrier, in its submissions to the Board, identified conferencing as a "question in dispute."  See supra, at 76, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 440. 

  It makes sense to exclude at the arbitration stage newly presented "data . . . in support of [the] employee['s] [grievance]," 29 CFR § 301.5(d) --evidence the carrier had no opportunity to consider prearbitration.  A contrary rule would sandbag the carrier.  But conferencing is not a fact bearing on the merits of a grievance.  Indeed, there may be no disagreement at all about the occurrence of conferencing, as the Union believed to be the case here.  Moreover, the RLA respects the right of the parties to order for themselves the conference procedures they will follow.  See 45 U.S.C. § 152 Sixth ("[N]othing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede the provisions of any agreement (as to conferences) . . . in effect between the parties.").  In sum, neither the RLA nor Circular One could plausibly be read to require, as a prerequisite to the NRAB's exercise of jurisdiction, submission of proof of conferencing.

By refusing to adjudicate cases on the false premise that it lacked power to hear them, the NRAB panel failed "to conform, or confine itself," to the jurisdiction Congress gave it.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. 

It is so ordered. 


Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. 

  A federal habeas court will not review a claim rejected by a state court "if the decision of [the state] court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment."  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991).  We granted certiorari to decide the following question:   "Is a state procedural rule automatically 'inadequate' under the adequate-state-grounds doctrine--and therefore unenforceable on federal habeas corpus review--because the state rule is discretionary rather than mandatory?" Pet. for Cert. i.  Petitioners argue the correct answer is "no."  At oral argument, respondent--consistent with his position below--expressly agreed.  We do too, and accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 

I 

In 1982, Joseph Kindler, along with Scott Shaw and David Bernstein, burglarized a music store in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Police stopped the getaway car and arrested Shaw and Bernstein.  In a harbinger of things to come, Kindler escaped.  Commonwealth v. Kindler, 536 Pa. 228, 236, 639 A.2d 1, 5, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 933, 115 S. Ct. 327, 130 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1994). 

 Police later arrested Kindler and charged him with burglary.  He was released on bail.  Bernstein agreed to testify against Kindler, but Kindler had other plans.  At about 2:30 a.m. on July 25, 1982, Kindler and Shaw attacked Bernstein outside his apartment.  Kindler beat Bernstein with a baseball bat approximately 20 times, and Shaw shocked Bernstein 5 times with an electric prod.  Bernstein at that point was still alive but unable to move, and Kindler and Shaw dragged their victim to their nearby car, loaded him in the trunk, and drove to the Delaware River.  At the river, Kindler tied a cinder block around Bernstein's neck and dumped him in the water.  A forensic examiner later determined that Bernstein died of drowning and massive head injuries.  536 Pa., at 236-239, 639 A.2d, at 5-6. 

Kindler was brought to trial and convicted of capital murder.  The jury recommended a death sentence, and Kindler filed postverdict motions.  Id., at 230-231, 639 A.2d, at 2. 

But on September 19, 1984, before the trial court could consider the motions or the jury's death recommendation, Kindler escaped. Ibid.  In an organized effort to saw through the external prison bars with smuggled tools, Kindler broke out of the maximum-security wing of the prison and headed for Canada.  See Commonwealth v. Kindler, 554 Pa. 513, 517-518, and n. 4, 722 A.2d 143, 145 (1998). 

Kindler remained a fugitive in Canada until April 26, 1985, when he was arrested in Quebec for separate burglary offenses.  The United States sought Kindler's return, but an extradition treaty allowed Canada to refuse to hand over anyone likely to face execution.  See Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [1991] 2 S. C. R. 779, 84 D.L.R. (4th) 438. 

Kindler turned into something of a local celebrity.  He even appeared on Canadian television, explaining, among other things, how he had escaped and why he chose Canada:  "I knew there was no death penalty here."  CTV National News:  Joseph Kindler's Fate Unresolved (Canadian television broadcast Sept. 22, 1985) (videos available in Clerk of Court's case file).  Canadian authorities ultimately acquiesced to overtures from the United States and agreed to extradite Kindler.  Kindler, 536 Pa., at 231, 639 A.2d, at 2. 

But before Kindler could be transferred from Canadian custody, he escaped again.  On the night of October 23, 1986, Kindler broke through a skylight on the 13th floor of the jail (his fellow inmates had hoisted him up to the skylight 15 feet above the floor) and escaped to the roof, where he stood 175 feet above ground.  Armed with 13 stories' worth of bedsheets tied together, Kindler safely rappelled down the side of the jail.  (A fellow escapee was not as lucky--the sheets ripped on his way down, causing him to fall 50 feet to his death.)  Kindler, 554 Pa., at 517-519, 722 A.2d, at 145. 

This time, Kindler remained on the lam for nearly two years, until he was featured on the popular television show, "America's Most Wanted."  Characterizing Kindler as "an above average criminal" and "a chess player who understands when to make his move," the show asked viewers for information to help capture him.  America's Most Wanted, Sept. 4, 1988, Season 1, Episode 30, at 10:01.  Several viewers recognized Kindler and notified Canadian authorities, who arrested him in September 1988.  554 Pa., at 519, 722 A.2d, at 145. 

Kindler again fought extradition.  On September 16, 1991, after three years of litigation, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected Kindler's efforts.  See Kindler, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779, 84 D.L.R. (4th) 438.  That same day, Canadian officials extradited Kindler to the United States.  Kindler v. Horn, 291 F. Supp. 2d 323, 334 (ED Pa. 2003). 

In the meantime, in 1984, the Pennsylvania trial court had dismissed Kindler's postverdict motions because of his original escape.  Once back in the United States, Kindler filed a motion to reinstate those challenges to his conviction and sentence.  The trial court denied the reinstatement motion, holding that the trial court judge who had dismissed the postverdict motions in 1984 had not abused his discretion.  In October 1991--more than seven years after the jury's death recommendation--the court formally imposed the death sentence.  Commonwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (Ct. Common Pleas, Feb. 28, 1992), App. 66-70. 

Kindler appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in declining to address the merits of his postverdict motions.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. Kindler, 536 Pa., at 232-234, 639 A.2d, at 3.  That court recognized that "trial courts, when faced with a defendant in fugitive status, . . . have every right to fashion an appropriate response[,] which can include the dismissal of pending post-verdict motions."  Id., at 233, 639 A.2d, at 3.  The court then determined that the trial court's decision to dismiss Kindler's claims fell within its authority:  The "dismiss[al] [of] the post-verdict motions was a reasonable response to Appellant's 'flouting' of the authority of the court."  Id., at 233-234, 639 A.2d, at 3.  Under Pennsylvania's fugitive forfeiture law, the court concluded, Kindler's case therefore came to it "without any allegations of error (direct or collateral) preserved."  Id., at 234, 639 A.2d, at 4. 

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court nonetheless conducted the "limited review" mandated for death sentences under Pennsylvanialaw.  Under that review, the court was required to confirm that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of first-degree murder and at least one aggravating factor, and that the sentence was not excessive, disproportionate, or the product of passion or prejudice.  Id., at 234-235, 639 A.2d, at 4.  Satisfied that Kindler's conviction met these standards, the court affirmed his conviction and sentence.  We denied certiorari.  Kindler v. Pennsylvania, 513 U.S. 933, 115 S. Ct. 327, 130 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1994). 

On state habeas, the Court of Common Pleas rejected Kindler's claims.  That court held that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had already ruled that Kindler's escape forfeited all claims challenging his conviction and sentence that Kindler may once have been entitled to bring. Commonwealth v. Kindler, No. 2747 etc. (July 23, 1997), App. 183, 187-188.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed.  Kindler, 554 Pa., at 514, 722 A.2d, at 143. 

Kindler then sought federal habeas relief. The District Court determined that the fugitive forfeiture rule did not provide an adequate basis to bar federal review of Kindler's habeas claims.  291 F. Supp. 2d at 340-343. The District Court then proceeded to address the merits, granting Kindler's petition on the grounds that he was sentenced based on jury instructions that were unconstitutional under Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1988), and that the prosecutor improperly introduced an aggravating factor at sentencing. 291 F. Supp. 2d at 346-351, 357-358.  The court rejected Kindler's ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Id., at 356. 

The Third Circuit affirmed.  That court began by recognizing that "[a] procedural rule that is consistently applied in the vast majority of cases is adequate to bar federal habeas review even if state courts are willing to occasionally overlook it and review the merits of a claim for relief where the rule would otherwise apply."  Kindler v. Horn, 542 F.3d 70, 79 (2008).  The Court of Appeals then considered the Pennsylvania fugitive forfeiture rule in place at the time of Kindler's first escape:  "Pennsylvania courts had discretion to hear an appeal filed by a fugitive who had been returned to custody before an appeal was initiated or dismissed. . . .  Accordingly, the fugitive forfeiture rule was not 'firmly established' and therefore was not an independent and adequate procedural rule sufficient to bar review of the merits of a habeas petition in federal court."  Ibid. (citing Doctor v. Walters, 96 F.3d 675, 684-686 (CA3 1996)).  The court thus determined that "the state trial court still had discretion to reinstate his post-verdict motions.  Accordingly, we conclude that, under Doctor, Pennsylvania's fugitive waiver law did not preclude the district court from reviewing the merits of the claims raised in Kindler's habeas petition."542 F.3d, at 80.  Turning to the merits, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the District Court on the improper aggravating factor claim, but held that Kindler was entitled to relief based on his Mills and ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  542 F.3d, at 80-87. 

The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari, arguing that the Court of Appeals' determination that state discretionary rules are automatically inadequate conflicted with the holdings of other Courts of Appeals and warranted this Court's review.  Pet. for Cert. 6-11.  Kindler countered that the Commonwealth had mischaracterized the Third Circuit's holding.  Relying on the court's citation of the Doctor opinion, Kindler argued that the Third Circuit did not hold that discretionary state rules are automatically inadequate; rather the court determined that the state courts applied "a new and different rule from that in existence at the time of the alleged default."  Brief in Opposition 3.  It was that new rule, Kindler maintained, that the Third Circuit found inadequate.  Ibid.

We granted the Commonwealth's petition for certiorari.  556 U.S. 1234, 129 S. Ct. 2381, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1292 (2009).  That petition asks us to decide whether discretionary procedural rulings are automatically inadequate to bar federal court review on habeas. 

II 

  The question whether a state procedural ruling is adequate is itself a question of federal law.  Lee v. Kemna, 534 U.S. 362, 375, 122 S. Ct. 877, 151 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2002).  We have framed the adequacy inquiry by asking whether the state rule in question was "'firmly established and regularly followed.'"  Id., at 376, 122 S. Ct. 877, 151 L. Ed. 2d 820 (quoting James v. Kentucky, 466 U.S. 341, 348, 104 S. Ct. 1830, 80 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1984)). 

We hold that  a discretionary state procedural rule can serve as an adequate ground to bar federal habeas review.  Nothing inherent in such a rule renders it inadequate for purposes of the adequate state ground doctrine.  To the contrary, a discretionary rule can be "firmly established" and "regularly followed"--even if the appropriate exercise of discretion may permit consideration of a federal claim in some cases but not others.  See Meltzer, State Court Forfeitures of Federal Rights, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 1128, 1140 (1986) ("[R]efusals to exercise discretion do not form an important independent category under the inadequate state ground doctrine"). 

A contrary holding would pose an unnecessary dilemma for the States:  States could preserve flexibility by granting courts discretion to excuse procedural errors, but only at the cost of undermining the finality of state court judgments.  Or States could preserve the finality of their judgments by withholding such discretion, but only at the cost of precluding any flexibility in applying the rules. 

We are told that, if forced to choose, many States would opt for mandatory rules to avoid the high costs that come with plenary federal review.  See, e.g., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 19; Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 14.  That would be unfortunate in many cases, as discretionary rules are often desirable.  In some circumstances, for example, the factors facing trial courts "are so numerous, variable and subtle that the fashioning of rigid rules would be more likely to impair [the trial judge's] ability to deal fairly with a particular problem than to lead to a just result."  United States v. McCoy, 517 F.2d 41, 44 (CA7) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 895, 96 S. Ct. 195, 46 L. Ed. 2d 127 (1975); see also Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L. J. 747, 760-761 (1982).  The result would be particularly unfortunate for criminal defendants, who would lose the opportunity to argue that a procedural default should be excused through the exercise of judicial discretion.  See Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 463, n. 3, 85 S. Ct. 564, 13 L. Ed. 2d 408 (1965) (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("If, in order to insulate its decisions from reversal by this Court, a state court must strip itself of the discretionary power to differentiate between different sets of circumstances, the [adequate state ground] rule operates in a most perverse way"). 

It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that  the federal system often grants broad discretion to the trial judge when his ringside perspective at the "'main event'" offers him a comparative advantage in decisionmaking. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977); cf. United States v.  Poynter, 495 F.3d 349, 351-352 (CA6 2007).  The States seem to value discretionary rules as much as the Federal Government does.  See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 16-17 (citing various state discretionary procedural rules).  In light of the federalism and comity concerns that motivate the adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas context, see Coleman, 501 U.S. at 730, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640, it would seem particularly strange to disregard state procedural rules that are substantially similar to those to which we give full force in our own courts.  Cf. Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 541-542, 96 S. Ct. 1708, 48 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1976).  Even stranger to do so with respect to rules in place in nearly every State, and all at one fell swoop. 

We take our holding in this case to be uncontroversial--so uncontroversial, in fact, that both parties agreed to the point before this Court.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-31.  Rather than defending the question on which we granted certiorari--whether discretionary rules are automatically inadequate--Kindler argues that the Pennsylvania courts did not apply a discretionary rule at all, but instead applied a new rule mandating dismissal.  Such a mandatory dismissal, Kindler contends, constituted a break from past discretionary practice, and thus does not provide an adequate state ground to bar his federal claims.  We leave it to the Court of Appeals to address that argument, and any others Kindler may have preserved, on remand. 

For its part, the Commonwealth urges us not only to reject a per se rule about discretionary rulings, but also to undertake "[a] new effort to state a standard for inadequacy."  Brief for Petitioners 25.  Amici supporting the Commonwealth join in that request.  See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6-10.  We decline that invitation as well.  The procedural default at issue here--escape from prison--is hardly a typical procedural default, making this case an unsuitable vehicle for providing broad guidance on the adequate state ground doctrine. 

If our holding in this case is narrow, it is because the question we granted certiorari to decide is narrow.  Answering that question is sufficient unto the day. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 

Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. 


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

 The Speedy Trial Act of 1974 (Speedy Trial Act or Act), 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., requires that a criminal defendant's trial commence within 70 days after he is charged or makes  an initial appearance, whichever is later, see § 3161(c)(1), and entitles him to dismissal of the charges if that deadline is not met, § 3162(a)(2). The Act, however, excludes from the 70-day period delays due to certain enumerated events. § 3161(h) (2006 ed. and Supp. II). As relevant here, “delay resulting from . . . proceedings concerning the defendant” is automatically excludable from a Speedy Trial Act calculation. § 3161(h)(1) (hereinafter subsection (h)(1)).1The excludability of delay “resulting from . . . proceedings” under subsection (h)(1) is ?automatic” in the sense that a district court must exclude such delay from a Speedy Trial Act calculation without any further analysis as to whether the benefit of the delay outweighs its cost. For delays resulting from proceedings under subsection (h)(1), Congress already has determined that the benefit of such delay outweighs its cost to a speedy trial, regardless of the specifics of the case. The word “automatic” serves as a useful shorthand. See, e.g., United States v. Lucky, 569 F.3d 101, 106 (CA2 2009) (“Some exclusions are automatic. Other exclusions require judicial action” (citation omitted)). In addition, “delay resulting from a continuance” granted by the district court may be excluded if the district court makes the findings required by § 3161(h)(7) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (hereinafter subsection (h)(7)).

This case requires us to decide the narrow question whether time granted to a party to prepare pretrial motions is automatically excludable from the Act's 70-day limit under subsection (h)(1), or whether such time may be excluded only if a court makes case-specific findings under subsection (h)(7). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that pretrial motion preparation time is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). 534 F.3d 893, 898 (2008).2After the Eighth Circuit issued its decision below, Congress passed the Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of 2008, 122 Stat. 4291, which made technical changes to the Speedy Trial Act, including the renumbering of several provisions. The amendments did not change the substance of any provision relevant here. Accordingly, in this opinion, including our discussions of the orders and decisions under review, we refer only to the current version of the Act. We granted certiorari, 556 U.S. 1181, 129 S. Ct. 1984, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1082 (2009), and now reverse.

A

On August 2, 2006, police officers surveilling an apartment building for drug activity saw petitioner and his girlfriend enter a car parked in front of the building and drive away. After observing petitioner commit several traffic violations, the officers stopped the vehicle. They approached the car and noticed two small bags of cocaine on petitioner's lap. After the officers read petitioner his Miranda warnings, petitioner made inculpatory statements. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Petitioner denied any association with the apartment building where the car had been parked, but his girlfriend admitted that she lived there and consented to a search of her residence. The officers who conducted the search uncovered several items that belonged to petitioner, including an identification card, cocaine, three firearms, ammunition, and a bulletproof vest. The police arrested petitioner the next day.

On August 24, a grand jury indicted petitioner for being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and for knowing and intentional possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). The August 24 indictment started the Speedy Trial Act's 70-day clock. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1). After petitioner's arraignment on September 1, a Magistrate Judge entered a scheduling order requiring, inter alia, that the parties file pretrial motions by September 13.

On September 7, petitioner filed a motion to extend the deadline to file pretrial motions from September 13 to September 21. The Magistrate Judge granted the motion and extended the deadline by an extra four days beyond petitioner's request, to September 25. On September 25, however, petitioner filed a “Waiver of Pretrial Motions” advising the court that he did not wish to file any pretrial motions.

 On October 4, the Magistrate Judge held a hearing to consider petitioner's “waiver,” at which petitioner confirmed that he wished to waive his right to file pretrial motions. After a colloquy, the Magistrate Judge found that petitioner's waiver was voluntary and intelligent.

Over the next three months, petitioner's trial was delayed for several reasons. Though these delays are not directly relevant to the question presented here, we recount them to explain the full context in which that question arises. On November 8, petitioner moved to continue the trial date, stating that his counsel needed additional time to prepare for trial. The District Court granted the motion and reset the trial for December 18.

The parties then met informally and prepared a plea agreement, which they provided to the court. The District Court scheduled a change of plea hearing for December 20. At the hearing, however, petitioner declined to implement the agreement and requested a new attorney. The District Court rescheduled the trial for February 26, 2007, granted petitioner's attorney's subsequent motion to withdraw, and appointed new counsel.

On February 19, 2007--179 days after petitioner was indicted--petitioner  moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the Act's 70-day limit had elapsed. The District Court denied the motion. In calculating how many of the 179 days counted toward the 70-day limit, the District Judge excluded the period from September 7 through October 4 as “within the extension of time granted to file pretrial motions.” Order in No. 4:06CR518-SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44, p. 2.3In addition, the District Judge excluded the continuance granted on November 9 (resetting the trial for December 18) under § 3161(h)(7)(A) (2006 ed., Supp. II), and excluded the time from November 9 through December 20 as delay resulting from a plea agreement under § 3161(h)(1)(G). He further excluded the time from December 20 through February 26 “as it . . . resulted from [petitioner's] election not to implement a plea agreement, and his request to the court to have new counsel appointed for him.” Order in No. 4:06CR518-SNL, Doc. 44, at 3. The judge stated on the record that these continuances were necessary to ensure that “the ends of justice could more properly be served” and “obviously outweighed the best interest of the public and the defendant to a Speedy Trial.” Ibid.

 In late February, a matter arose in an unrelated case on the District Court's docket, which required the court to reschedule petitioner's trial. After obtaining the consent of the parties and finding that a continuance would serve the public interest, the District Court continued petitioner's trial from February 26 to March 5, 2007. Petitioner's 2-day trial began on that date. The jury found petitioner guilty on both counts, and the District Court later sentenced him to concurrent 30-year terms of imprisonment.

B

Petitioner appealed his convictions and sentence to the Eighth Circuit, which affirmed the denial of his motion to dismiss for a Speedy Trial Act violation. As relevant, the Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the time from September 7 (the original deadline for filing pretrial motions) through October 4 (when the trial court held a hearing on petitioner's decision to waive the right to file pretrial motions) was excludable from the Act's 70-day limit. Although the District Court did not identify which provision of the Act supported this exclusion, the Court of Appeals held that “pretrial motion preparation time” is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1)--which covers “delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant”--as long as “the [district] court specifically grants time for that purpose.” 534 F.3d, at 897.4In addition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order excluding the time from November 9 to, and including, December 18 and from December 20 to, and including, February 23 as delays resulting from continuances under §§ 3161(h)(7) and 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), respectively. The Court of Appeals did not address whether to exclude December 19. Nor did it decide whether to exclude the delay from February 23 to March 5, because even if those days were included, “only 58 days passed between [petitioner]'s indictment and trial, fewer than the 70 allowed by the Speedy Trial Act.” 534 F.3d, at 900. In reaching this conclusion,  the Eighth Circuit joined seven other Courts of Appeals that interpret subsection (h)(1) the same way.5See United States v. Oberoi, 547 F.3d 436, 448-451 (CA2 2008); 534 F.3d 893, 897-898 (CA8 2008) (case below); United States v. Mejia,82 F.3d 1032, 1035-1036 (CA11 1996); United States v.

As noted, the Speedy Trial Act requires that a criminal defendant's trial commence within 70 days of a defendant's initial appearance or indictment, but excludes from the 70-day period days lost to certain types of delay. Section 3161(h) specifies the types of delays that are excludable from the calculation. Some of these delays are excludable only if the district court makes certain findings enumerated in the statute. See § 3161(h)(7). Other delays are automatically excludable, i.e., they may be excluded without district court findings. As relevant here, subsection (h)(1) requires the automatic exclusion of “[a]ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to” periods of delay resulting from eight enumerated subcategories of proceedings.7The full text of subsection (h)(1) reads as follows: “ (h) The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which an information or an indictment must be filed, or in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence:“(1) Any period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to--“(A) delay resulting from any proceeding, including any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant;“(B) delay resulting from trial with respect to other charges against the defendant;“(C) delay resulting from any interlocutory appeal;“(D) delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion;“(E) delay resulting from any proceeding relating to the transfer of a case or the removal of any defendant from another district under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure;“(F) delay resulting from transportation of any defendant from another district, or to and from places of examination or hospitalization, except that any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order of removal or an order directing such transportation, and the defendant's arrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable;“(G) delay resulting from consideration by the court of a proposed plea agreement to be entered into by the defendant and the attorney for the Government; and“(H) delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.” The Government contends  that the time the District Court granted petitioner to prepare his pretrial motions is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). We disagree, and conclude that such time may be excluded only when a district court enters appropriate findings under subsection (h)(7).

A

The eight subparagraphs in subsection (h)(1) address the automatic excludability of delay generated for certain enumerated purposes. Thus, we first consider whether the delay at issue in this case is governed by one of these subparagraphs. It is.

 The delay at issue was granted to allow petitioner sufficient time to file pretrial motions.8See Defendant's Request for Additional Time To File Pre-trial Motions in No. 4:06CR518-SNL (TCM) (ED Mo.), Doc. 19; Order in No. 4:06CR518-SNL (ED Mo.), Doc. 44 (granting same).Subsection (h)(1)(D) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (hereinafter subparagraph (D)) renders automatically excludable “delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion  through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.” Read, as it must be, in the context of subsection (h), this text governs the automatic excludability of delays “resulting? from a specific category of “proceedings concerning the defendant,” namely, proceedings involving pretrial motions.9The dissent argues that this conclusion lacks “force” because “[i]t is at least doubtful . . . that the delay at issue in the present case is delay 'resulting from [a] pretrial motion.” Post, at 220, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 73 (opinion of Alito, J.). According to the dissent, “delay 'resulting from' a pretrial motion is delay that occurs as a consequence of such a motion,” which the “type of delay involved in the present case” does not.” Post, at 221, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 73 (arguing that the delay in this case instead “occurs as a consequence of the court's granting of a defense request for an extension of time”).The dissent's position, which rests upon a dictionary definition of two isolated words, does not account for the governing statutory context. For the reasons we explain, the text and structure of subsection (h) support our conclusion that subparagraph (D) governs the automatic excludability of delays “resulting from” proceedings involving pretrial motions. As the dissent concedes, defining “resulting from” to mean “as a consequence of” does not foreclose our interpretation. That is because the dissent's definition of “resulting from” leaves ample room to conclude that the delay at issue here is “a consequence of” the category of proceedings covered by subparagraph (D), whether one views the delay “as a consequence of” a proceeding involving pretrial motions, or “as a consequence of” a pretrial motion itself (the defense request for additional time). At bottom, the dissent's position is not that our interpretation is foreclosed by the Act; it is that the dissent's interpretation is preferable. We disagree because the dissent's interpretation, among other things, fails to account fully for the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) and renders much of subsection (h)(7) a nullity. Because the delay at issue here results from a decision  granting time to prepare pretrial motions, if not from a pretrial motion itself (the defendant's request for additional time), it is governed by subparagraph (D). But that does not make the delay at issue here automatically excludable.

Subparagraph (D) does not subject all pretrial motion-related delay to automatic exclusion. Instead, it renders automatically excludable only the delay that occurs ?from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of” the motion. (Emphasis added.) In so doing, the provision communicates Congress' judgment that delay resulting from pretrial motions is automatically excludable, i.e., excludable without district court findings, only from the time a motion is filed through the hearing or disposition point specified in the subparagraph, and that other periods of pretrial motion-related delay are excludable only when accompanied by district court findings.10This conclusion flows not only from subparagraph (D)'s text, but also from its structure. As noted, subparagraph (D) excludes from the 70-day period “delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion.” In this case, the comma after the first phrase indicates that the second phrase modifies the scope of excludable delay referred to in the first. Thus, subparagraph (D)'s automatic exclusion for delay “resulting from” a pretrial motion is limited to delay that occurs from the filing of the motion through the endpoints identified in the provision.

This limitation is significant because Congress knew how to define the boundaries of an enumerated exclusion broadly when it so desired. Subsection (h)(1)(A) (hereinafter subparagraph (A)), for example, provides for the automatic exclusion of ?delay resulting from any proceeding, including any examinations, to determine the mental competency or physical capacity of the defendant.” (Emphasis added.) With the word ?including,” Congress indicated that  other competency-related proceedings besides “examinations” might fall within subparagraph (A)'s automatic exclusion.  In subparagraph (D), by contrast, Congress declined to use an expansive or illustrative term such as “including,” and provided instead that only pretrial motion-related delay “from the filing” of a motion to the hearing or disposition point specified in the provision is automatically excludable from the Act's 70-day limit.

Thus, although the period of delay the Government seeks to exclude in this case results from a proceeding governed by subparagraph (D), that period precedes the first day upon which Congress specified that such delay may be automatically excluded. The result is that the pretrial motion preparation time at issue in this case is not automatically excludable.11Whether the defendant actually files a pretrial motion for which he requests additional time is irrelevant to this analysis. Even if he files such a motion, that filing may not be used to bootstrap into the period of automatically excludable delay pre-filing preparation time that subparagraph (D) does not render automatically excludable.

 B

The foregoing analysis resolves our inquiry into automatic excludability because “[a] specific provision” (here, subparagraph (D)) “controls one[s] of more general application” (here, subsections (h)(1) and (h)(7)). Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919 (1991). In arguing that this principle applies, but requires a result different from the one we reach, the dissent (like the Government and several Courts of Appeals) departs from the statute in a manner that underscores the propriety of our approach.

1

 There is no question that subparagraph (D) is more specific than the “general” language in subsection (h)(1), post, at 218, 222, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72, 74, or that  “[g]eneral language of a statutory provision, although broad enough to include it, will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment,” D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204, 208, 52 S. Ct. 322, 76 L. Ed. 704 (1932). We part company with the dissent because we conclude that subparagraph (D) governs the period of delay at issue in this case. The dissent does not object to this conclusion on the ground that it is foreclosed by the statute. See post, at 221, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 74 (asserting that the delay at issue in this case is “not necessarily” covered by subparagraph (D)). Instead, it joins the Government in asserting that the Act is amenable to another interpretation that would avoid the “strange result” that “petitioner may be entitled to dismissal of the charges against him because his attorney persuaded a Magistrate Judge to give the defense additional time to prepare pretrial motions and thus delayed the commencement of his trial.” Post, at 217, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 71. This argument takes aim at an exaggerated target. Because we conclude that the type of delay at issue here is excludable under subsection (h)(7), courts can in future cases easily avoid the result the dissent decries, a result that is not certain even in this case. See infra, at 214-215, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 69-70. And even if dismissal is ultimately required on remand, a desire to avoid this result does not justify reading subsection (h)(1) (and specifically its reference to “other proceedings concerning the defendant”) to permit automatic exclusion of delay  resulting from virtually any decision to continue a deadline.

The dissent first argues that the delay in this case is automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1) because the provision's use of the phrase “including but not limited to” shows that subsection (h)(1) permits automatic exclusion of delays beyond those covered by its enumerated subparagraphs. See post, at 219, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72; see also United States v. Oberoi, 547 F.3d 436, 450 (CA2 2008). This argument confuses the illustrative nature of subsection (h)(1)'s list of categories of excludable delay (each of which is represented by a subparagraph) with the contents of the categories themselves. That the list of categories is illustrative rather than exhaustive in no way undermines our conclusion that a delay that falls within the category of delay addressed by subparagraph (D) is governed by the limits in that subparagraph. The “including  but not limited to” clause would affect our conclusion only if one read it to modify the contents of subparagraph (D) as well as the list itself. As noted, such a reading would violate settled principles of statutory construction because it would ignore the structure and grammar of subsection (h)(1), and in so doing render even the clearest of the subparagraphs indeterminate and virtually superfluous. See Gozlon-Peretz, supra, at 410, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919; Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 150 L. Ed. 2d  251 (2001) ( “[A] statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Our reading avoids these problems by treating the list as illustrative, but construing each of the eight subparagraphs in (h)(1) to govern, conclusively unless the subparagraph itself indicates otherwise, see, e.g., § 3161(h)(1)(A); supra, at 206-207, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 64, the automatic excludability of the delay resulting from the category of proceedings it addresses.

The dissent responds that, even if subparagraph (D)'s limits are conclusive rather than merely illustrative, we should automatically exclude the delay at issue here under subsection (h)(1)'s opening clause, see post, at 218, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72, because it is not “clear” that the delay is governed by the more specific (and restrictive) language in subparagraph (D). Post, at 222, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 74. We decline this invitation to use the alleged uncertainty in subparagraph (D)'s scope as a justification for disregarding its limits and instead expanding, through liberal interpretation of subsection (h)(1)'s generic opening clause,12The dissent argues that the relevant “proceeding” in this case is the District Court's disposition of petitioner's motion for additional time to file pretrial motions. See post, at 218, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 72. If that were correct, any order disposing of a motion--including a pretrial motion under subparagraph (D) --would be a separate “proceeding,” and any resulting delay would be automatically excludable. The dissent's reading renders superfluous the two provisions in subsection (h)(7) that require findings for the exclusion of time necessary for “adequate preparation for pretrial proceedings,” § 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii), and “effective preparation,” § 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv). See also infra, at 211, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 67-68. what the  dissent itself describes as the automatic exclusion “exceptio[n]” to the Act's 70-day period and the Act's “general rule” requiring “ends-of-justice findings for continuances.” Post, at 227, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 77.

 On the dissent's reading of subsection (h)(1), a court could extend by weeks or months, without any finding that the incursion on the Act's timeliness guarantee is justified, the entire portion of a criminal proceeding for which the Act sets a default limit of 70 days. The problem with this reading is clear: It relies on an interpretation of subsection (h)(1) that admits of no principled, text-based limit on the definition of a “proceedin[g] concerning the defendant,” and thus threatens the Act's manifest purpose of ensuring speedy trials by construing the Act's automatic exclusion exceptions in a manner that could swallow the 70-day rule. This approach is not justified, much less compelled, by the textual ambiguities and legislative history upon which the dissent relies. Nor is it justified by the prospect, however appealing, of reaching a different result in this case. Hence our conclusion that the text and structure of subsection (h)(1) do not permit automatic exclusion of the delay at issue in this case.

2

Our conclusion is further supported by subsection (h)(1)'s context, particularly neighboring subsection (h)(7). Subsection (h)(7) provides that delays “resulting from a continuance granted by any judge” may be excluded, but only if the judge finds that “the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial” and records those findings. In setting forth the statutory factors that justify a continuance under subsection (h)(7), Congress twice recognized the importance of adequate pretrial preparation time. See § 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii) (requiring a district court to consider whether the “unusual” or “complex” nature of a case makes it “unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits” (emphasis added)); § 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv) (requiring a district court to consider in other cases “[w]hether the failure to grant such a continuance . . . would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence” (emphasis added)). Our determination that the delay at issue here is not automatically excludable gives full effect to subsection (h)(7), and respects its provisions for excluding certain types of delay only where a district court makes findings justifying the exclusion.13Had Congress wished courts to exclude pretrial motion preparation time automatically, it could have said so. As noted, subsection (h)(7) twice refers to preparation time to explain the kinds of continuances that a court may grant in the interests of justice. See §§ 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii), (h)(7)(B)(iv). Congress easily could have referred to preparation time similarly in subsection (h)(1). See, e.g., Speedy Trial Act Amendments Act of 1979, H. R. 3630, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., § 5(c) (1979) (proposing to exclude under subparagraph (D) all “delay resulting from the preparation and service of pretrial motions and responses and from hearings thereon” (emphasis added)). Congress did not do so, and we are bound to enforce only the language that Congress and the President enacted. Cf. post, at 227, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 77-78 (construing subsection (h)(1) in a manner that could encompass, and govern, delays expressly within subsection (h)(7)'s purview).

3

Finally, our Speedy Trial Act precedents support our reading of subsection (h)(1). We recently explained that the Act serves not only to protect defendants, but also to vindicate the public interest in the swift administration of justice. We thus held that a defendant may not opt out of the Act even if he believes it would be in his interest; “[a]llowing prospective waivers would seriously undermine the Act because there are many cases . . . in which the prosecution, the defense, and the court would all be happy to opt out of the Act,  to the detriment of the public interest.” Zedner v. United States, 547 U.S. 489, 502, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749 (2006).14Our interpretation of the Act accords with this and other precedents in a way the dissent's interpretation does not. In Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 322, 106 S. Ct. 1871, 90 L. Ed. 2d 299 (1986), for example, we carefully examined the text of § 3161(h)(1)(F) (now codified as subparagraph (D)) to determine whether certain periods of pretrial motion-related delay were automatically excludable. Such careful parsing would seem unnecessary were the dissent right that subparagraph (D) does not conclusively define the maximum period of excludable delay for the category of pretrial motion-related proceedings and that such delay may simply be excluded under subsection (h)(1).

Courts of Appeals that have read subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that their interpretation is necessary to provide defendants adequate time to build their defense. See, e.g., United States v. Mobile Materials, Inc., 871 F.2d 902, 913(per curiam), opinion supplemented on other grounds on rehearing, 881 F.2d 866 (CA10 1989)(per curiam). Yet these same courts have recognized that reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude all time for preparing pretrial motions would undermine the guarantee of a speedy trial, and thus harm the public interest we have recognized in preserving that guarantee even where one or both parties to a proceeding would be willing to waive it. See Zedner, supra, at 502, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749. To avoid a result so inconsistent with the statute's purpose--i.e., ?to avoid creating a big loophole in the statute,”United States v. Tibboel, 753 F.2d 608, 610 (CA7 1985)--these courts have found it necessary to craft limitations on the automatic exclusion for pretrial motion preparation time that their interpretation of subsection (h)(1) otherwise would allow. See, e.g., ibid. (stating that pretrial motion preparation time may be automatically excluded under subsection (h)(1) only when “the judge has expressly granted a party time for that purpose” (emphasis added)); Oberoi, 547 F.3d, at 450 (“This . . . qualification prevents abuse. Without it, either party 'could  delay trial indefinitely merely by working on pretrial motions right up to the eve of trial' ”).

The fact that courts reading subsection (h)(1) to exclude preparation time have imposed extratextual limitations on excludability to avoid “creating a big loophole in the statute,” Tibboel, supra, at 610, underscores the extent to which their interpretation--and the dissent's--strays from the Act's text and purpose. As noted, subsection (h)(7) expressly accounts for the possibility that a district court would need to delay a trial to give the parties adequate preparation time. An exclusion under subsection (h)(7) is not automatic, however, and requires specific findings. Allowing district courts to exclude automatically such delays would redesign this statutory framework.

C

We also note that some of the Courts of Appeals that have interpreted subsection (h)(1) to exclude automatically pretrial motion preparation time have reasoned that a contrary reading of that provision would lay “a trap for trial judges” by  forcing them to risk a Speedy Trial Act violation if they wish to grant a defendant's request for additional time to prepare a pretrial motion, United States v. Wilson, 835 F.2d 1440, 1444, 266 U.S. App. D.C. 344 (CADC 1987); see also Oberoi, supra, at 450.

We acknowledge that it would be unpalatable to interpret the Speedy Trial Act to “trap” district courts for accommodating a defendant's request for additional time to prepare pretrial motions, particularly in a case like this. Petitioner instigated all of the pretrial delays except for the final continuance from February 26 to March 5. And the record clearly shows that the Magistrate Judge and the District Court diligently endeavored to accommodate petitioner's requests--granting his motion for an extension of time to decide whether to file pretrial motions, his motion for a continuance, and his motion for a new attorney and for time to allow this new attorney to become familiar with the case. Fortunately, we can abide by the limitations Congress imposed  on the statutory rights at issue here without interpreting the Act in a manner that would trap trial courts.

For the reasons we explained above, neither subparagraph (D) nor subsection (h)(1) automatically excludes time granted to prepare pretrial motions. This conclusion does not lay a “trap for trial judges” because it limits (in a way the statute requires) only automatic exclusions. In considering any request for delay, whether the exclusion of time will be automatic or not, trial judges always have to devote time to assessing whether the reasons for the delay are justified, given both the statutory and constitutional requirement of speedy trials. Placing these reasons in the record does not add an appreciable burden on these judges. Neither are district courts forced to choose between rejecting a defendant's request for time to prepare pretrial motions and risking dismissal of the indictment if preparation time delays the trial. Instead, a district court may exclude preparation time under subsection (h)(7) if it grants a continuance for that purpose based on recorded findings “that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.” Subsection (h)(7) provides “[m]uch of the Act's flexibility,” Zedner, 547 U.S., at 498, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749, and gives district courts “discretion--within limits and subject to specific procedures--to accommodate limited delays for case-specific needs,” id., at 499, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749. The statutory scheme thus ensures that district courts may grant necessary pretrial motion preparation time without risking dismissal.

Still, the Government suggests that, in some cases, a district court may fail to make the findings necessary for an exclusion under subsection (h)(7), leading to a windfall gain for a defendant who induces delay beyond the Act's 70-day limit. Dismissal, however, need not represent a windfall.  A district court may dismiss the charges without prejudice, thus allowing the Government to refile charges or reindict the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(1). In ruling upon a motion to dismiss under the Act, a district court should consider,  among other factors, the party responsible for the delay. See ibid. ( "In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without prejudice, the [district] court shall consider, among others, each of the following factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice” (emphasis added)); see also United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326, 343, 108 S. Ct. 2413, 101 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1988) (“Seemingly ignored were the brevity of the delay and the consequential lack of prejudice to respondent, as well as respondent's own illicit contribution to the delay”).

III

Based on this analysis, we hold that the 28-day period from September 7 through October 4, which includes the additional time granted by the District Court for pretrial motion preparation, is not automatically excludable under subsection (h)(1). The Court of Appeals did not address whether any portion of that time might have been otherwise excludable. Nor did the Government assert in its merits brief that another provision of the Act could support exclusion, presenting the argument that September 25 through October 4 could be excluded separately only in its brief in opposition to certiorari and during oral argument. We therefore do not consider whether any other exclusion would apply to all or part of the 28-day period. Instead, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether the calculation of an attorney's fee, under federal fee-shifting statutes, based on the “lodestar,” i.e., the number of hours worked multiplied by the prevailing hourly rates, may be increased due to superior performance and results.1Justice Breyer would have us answer this question “Yes” and then end the opinion. See post, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 511 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Such an opinion would be of little use to the bench or bar and would pointlessly invite an additional round of litigation. The issue of the standards to be applied in granting an enhancement is fairly subsumed within the question that we agreed to decide and has been extensively discussed in the briefs filed in this case. We have stated in previous cases that such an increase is permitted in extraordinary circumstances, and we reaffirm that rule. But as we have also said in prior cases, there is a strong presumption that the lodestar is sufficient; factors subsumed in the lodestar calculation cannot be used as a ground for increasing an award above the lodestar; and a party seeking fees has the burden of identifying a factor that the lodestar does not adequately take into account and proving with specificity that an enhanced fee is justified. Because the District Court did not apply these standards, we reverse the decision below and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

A 

Respondents (plaintiffs below) are children in the Georgia foster-care system and their next friends. They filed this class action on behalf of 3,000 children in foster care and named as defendants the Governor of Georgia and various state officials (petitioners in this case). Claiming that deficiencies in the foster-care system in two counties near Atlanta violated their federal and state constitutional and statutory rights, respondents sought injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as attorney's fees and expenses.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia eventually referred the case to mediation, where the parties entered into a consent decree, which the District Court approved. The consent decree resolved all pending issues other than the fees that respondents' attorneys were entitled to receive under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.2Title 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) provides: “In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1981a, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title, title IX of Public Law 92-318, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or section 13981 of this title, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs . . . .” (Citations omitted.)

B 

Respondents submitted a request for more than $14 million in attorney's fees. Half of that amount was based on their calculation of the lodestar--roughly 30,000 hours multiplied by hourly rates of $200 to $495 for attorneys and $75 to $150 for non-attorneys. In support of their fee request, respondents submitted affidavits asserting that these rates were within the range of prevailing market rates for legal services in the relevant market.

 The other half of the amount that respondents sought represented a fee enhancement for superior work and results. Affidavits submitted in support of this request claimed that the lodestar amount “would be generally insufficient to induce lawyers of comparable skill, judgment, professional representation and experience” to litigate this case. See, e.g., App. 80. Petitioners objected to the fee request, contending that some of the proposed hourly rates were too high, that the hours claimed were excessive, and that the enhancement would duplicate factors that were reflected in the lodestar amount.

The District Court awarded fees of approximately $10.5 million. See 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1296 (ND Ga. 2006). The District Court found that the hourly rates proposed by respondents were “fair and reasonable,” id., at 1285, but that some of the entries on counsel's billing records were vague and that the hours claimed for many of the billing categories were excessive. The court therefore cut the nontravel hours by 15% and halved the hourly rate for travel hours. This resulted in a lodestar calculation of approximately $6 million.

The court then enhanced this award by 75%, concluding that the lodestar calculation did not take into account “(1) the fact that class counsel were required to advance case expenses of $1.7 million over a three-year period with no on[-]going reimbursement, (2) the fact that class counsel were not paid on an on-going basis as the work was being performed, and (3) the fact that class counsel's ability to recover a fee and expense reimbursement were completely contingent on the outcome of the case.” Id., at 1288. The court stated that respondents' attorneys had exhibited “a higher degree of skill, commitment, dedication, and professionalism . . . than the Court has seen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the bench.” Id., at 1289. The court also commented that the results obtained were “ 'extraordinary' ” and added that “[a]fter 58  years as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive scale.” Id., at 1290. The enhancement resulted in an additional $4.5 million fee award.

Relying on prior Circuit precedent, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 532 F.3d 1209 (2008). The panel held that the District Court had not abused its discretion by failing to make a larger reduction in the number of hours for which respondents' attorneys sought reimbursement, but the panel commented that it “would have cut the billable hours more if we were deciding the matter in the first instance” and added that the hourly rates approved by the District Court also “appear[ed] to be on the generous side.” Id., at 1220, and n. 2. On the question of the enhancement, however, the panel splintered, with each judge writing a separate opinion.

Judge Carnes concluded that binding Eleventh Circuit precedent required that the decision of the District Court be affirmed, but he opined that the reasoning in our opinions suggested that no enhancement should be allowed in this case. He concluded that the quality of the attorneys' performance was “adequately accounted for 'either in determining the reasonable number of hours expended on the litigation or in setting the reasonable hourly rates.' Id., at 1225 (quoting Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 565-566, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1986)(Delaware Valley I)). He found that an enhancement could not be justified based on delay in the recovery of attorney's fees and reimbursable expenses because such delay is a routine feature of cases brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. And he reasoned that the District Court had contravened our holding in Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1992), when it relied on “ 'the fact that class counsel's compensation was totally contingent upon prevailing in this action.' 532 F.3d at 1226, 1228 (quoting affidavit in support of fee request).

 Judge Wilson concurred in the judgment but disagreed with Judge Carnes' view that Eleventh Circuit precedent is inconsistent with our decisions. Judge Hill also concurred in the judgment but expressed no view about the correctness of the prior Circuit precedent.

The Eleventh Circuit denied re hearing en banc over the dissent of three judges. See 547 F.3d 1319 (2008). Judge Wilson filed an opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing; Judge Carnes, joined by Judges Tjoflat and Dubina, filed an opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing; and Judge Tjoflat filed a separate dissent, contending, among other things, that the District Court, by basing the enhancement in large part on a comparison of the performance of respondents' attorneys with all of the unnamed attorneys whose work he had observed during his professional career, had improperly rendered a decision that was effectively unreviewable on appeal and had essentially served as a witness in support of the enhancement. Id., at 1326-1327.

We granted certiorari. 556 U.S. 1165, 129 S. Ct. 1907, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2009).

II 

 The general rule in our legal system is that each party must pay its own attorney's fees and expenses, see Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983), but Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. § 1988 in order to ensure that federal rights are adequately enforced. Section 1988 provides that a prevailing party in certain civil rights actions may recover “a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs.”3Virtually identical language appears in many of the federal fee-shifting statutes. See Burlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 562, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1992). Unfortunately, the statute does not explain what Congress meant by a “reasonable” fee, and therefore the task of identifying an appropriate methodology for determining a “reasonable” fee was left for the courts.

One possible method was set out in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d 714, 717-719 (CA5 1974),  which listed 12 factors that a court should consider in determining a reasonable fee.4These factors were: “(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to the acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the 'undesirability' of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.” Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 430, n. 3, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983). This method, however, “gave very little actual guidance to district courts. Setting attorney's fees by reference to a series of sometimes subjective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 563, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439.

An alternative, the lodestar approach, was pioneered by the Third Circuit in Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. of Philadelphia v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 487 F.2d 161 (1973), appeal after remand, 540 F.2d 102 (1976), and “achieved dominance in the federal courts” after our decision in Hensley. Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535 U.S. 789, 801, 122 S. Ct. 1817, 152 L. Ed. 2d 996 (2002). “Since that time,  '[t]he “lodestar” figure has, as its name suggests, become the guiding light of our fee-shifting jurisprudence.' ” Ibid. (quoting Dague, supra, at 562, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449).

Although the lodestar method is not perfect, it has several important virtues. First, in accordance with our understanding of the aim of fee-shifting statutes, the lodestar looks to “the prevailing market rates in the relevant community.” Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984). Developed after the practice of hourly billing had become widespread, see Gisbrecht, supra, at 801, 122 S. Ct. 1817, 152 L. Ed. 2d 996, the lodestar method produces an award that roughly approximates the fee that the prevailing attorney would have received if he or she had been representing a paying client who was billed by the hour in a comparable case. Second, the lodestar method is readily administrable, see Dague, supra, at 566, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449; see also Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,532 U.S. 598, 609, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 149 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2001); and unlike theJohnson approach, the lodestar calculation is “objective,” Hensley, supra, at 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40, and thus cabins the discretion of trial judges, permits meaningful judicial review, and produces reasonably predictable results.

III 

Our prior decisions concerning the federal fee-shifting statutes have established six important rules that lead to our decision in this case.

First,  a “reasonable” fee is a fee that is sufficient to induce a capable attorney to undertake the representation of a meritorious civil rights case. See Delaware Valley I, 478 U.S., at 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439 (“[I]f plaintiffs . . . find it possible to engage a lawyer based on the statutory assurance that he will be paid a 'reasonable fee,' the purpose behind the fee-shifting statute has been satisfied”); Blum, supra, at 897, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (“[A] reasonable attorney's fee is one that is adequate to attract competent counsel, but that does not produce windfalls to attorneys” (ellipsis, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted)). Section 1988's aim is to enforce the covered civil rights statutes, not to provide “a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439.

Second, the lodestar method yields a fee that is presumptively sufficient to achieve this objective. See Dague, 505 U.S., at 562, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439; Blum, supra, at 897, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891; see also Gisbrecht, supra, at 801-802, 122 S. Ct. 1817, 152 L. Ed. 2d 996. Indeed, we have said that the presumption is a “strong” one. Dague, supra, at 562, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449; Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439.

Third,  although we have never sustained an enhancement of a lodestar amount for performance, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12, 17, we have repeatedly said that enhancements may be awarded in “ 'rare' ” and “ 'exceptional' ” circumstances. Delaware Valley I, supra, at 565, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439; Blum, supra, at 897, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891; Hensley, supra, at 435, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40.

 Fourth, we have noted that “the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors constituting a 'reasonable' attorney's fee,” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439, and have held that an enhancement may not be awarded based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation, see Dague, supra., at 562-563, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449; Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens' Council for Clean Air, 483 U.S. 711, 726-727, 107 S. Ct. 3078, 97 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1987)(Delaware Valley II) (plurality opinion); Blum,465 U.S., at 898, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891. We have thus held that the novelty and complexity of a case generally may not be used as a ground for an enhancement because these factors “presumably [are] fully reflected in the number of billable hours recorded by counsel.” Ibid. We have also held that the quality of an attorney's performance generally should not be used to adjust the lodestar “[b]ecause considerations concerning the quality of a prevailing party's counsel's representation normally are reflected in the reasonable hourly rate.” Delaware Valley I, supra, at 566, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439.

Fifth,  the burden of proving that an enhancement is necessary must be borne by the fee applicant. Dague, supra, at 561, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449; Blum,465 U.S., at 901-902, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891.

Finally,  a fee applicant seeking an enhancement must produce “specific evidence” that supports the award. Id., at 899, 901, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (An enhancement must be based on “evidence that enhancement was necessary to provide fair and reasonable compensation”). This requirement is essential if the lodestar method is to realize one of its chief virtues, i.e., providing a calculation that is objective and capable of being reviewed on appeal.

IV

A 

In light of what we have said in prior cases,  we reject any contention that a fee determined by the lodestar method may not be enhanced in any situation. The lodestar method was never intended to be conclusive in all circumstances. Instead,  there is a “strong presumption” that the lodestar figure is reasonable, but that presumption may be overcome in those rare circumstances in which the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.

B 

In this case, we are asked to decide whether either the quality of an attorney's performance or the results obtained are factors that may properly provide a basis for an enhancement. We treat these two factors as one. When a plaintiff's attorney achieves results that are more favorable than would have been predicted based on the governing law and the available evidence, the outcome may be attributable to superior performance and commitment of resources by plaintiff's counsel. Or the outcome may result from inferior performance by defense counsel, unanticipated defense concessions, unexpectedly favorable rulings by the court, an unexpectedly sympathetic jury, or simple luck. Since none of these latter causes can justify an enhanced award, superior results are relevant only to the extent it can be shown that they are the result of superior attorney performance. Thus, we need only consider whether superior attorney performance can justify an enhancement. And in light of the principles derived from our prior cases, we inquire whether there are circumstances in which superior attorney performance is not adequately taken into account in the lodestar calculation. We conclude that  there are a few such circumstances but that these circumstances are indeed “rare” and “exceptional,” and require specific evidence that the lodestar fee would not have been “adequate to attract competent counsel,” Blum, supra, at 897, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (internal quotation marks omitted).

First,  an enhancement may be appropriate where the method used in determining the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney's  true market value, as demonstrated in part during the litigation.5Respondents correctly note that an attorney's “brilliant insights and critical maneuvers sometimes matter far more than hours worked or years of experience.” Brief for Respondents 14. But as we said in Blum v. Stenson,465 U.S. 886, 898, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984), “[i]n those cases, the special skill and experience of counsel should be reflected in the reasonableness of the hourly rates.” This may occur if the hourly rate is determined by a formula that takes into account only a single factor (such as years since admission to the bar)6See, e.g., Salazar v. District of Columbia,123 F. Supp. 2d 8 (DC 2000); Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 572 F. Supp. 354 (DC 1983), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 746 F.2d 4, 241 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (CADC 1984). or perhaps only a few similar factors. In such a case, an enhancement may be appropriate so that an attorney is compensated at the rate that the attorney would receive in cases not governed by the federal fee-shifting statutes. But in order to provide a calculation that is objective and reviewable, the trial judge should adjust the attorney's hourly rate in accordance with specific proof linking the attorney's ability to a prevailing market rate.

Second,  an enhancement may be appropriate if the attorney's performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted. As Judge Carnes noted below, when an attorney agrees to represent a civil rights plaintiff who cannot afford to pay the attorney, the attorney presumably understands that no reimbursement is likely to be received until the successful resolution of the case, 532 F.3d at 1227, and therefore enhancements to compensate for delay in reimbursement for expenses must be reserved for unusual cases. In such exceptional cases, however, an enhancement may be allowed, but the amount of the enhancement must be calculated using a method that is reasonable, objective, and capable of being reviewed on appeal, such as by applying a standard rate of interest to the qualifying outlays of expenses.

 Third,  there may be extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney's performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees. An attorney who expects to be compensated under § 1988 presumably understands that payment of fees will generally not come until the end of the case, if at all. See ibid. Compensation for this delay is generally made “either by basing the award on current rates or by adjusting the fee based on historical rates to reflect its present value.” Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274, 282, 109 S. Ct. 2463, 105 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we do not rule out the possibility that an enhancement may be appropriate where an attorney assumes these costs in the face of unanticipated delay, particularly where the delay is unjustifiably caused by the defense. In such a case, however, the enhancement should be calculated by applying a method similar to that described above in connection with exceptional delay in obtaining reimbursement for expenses.

We reject the suggestion that it is appropriate to grant performance enhancements on the ground that departures from hourly billing are becoming more common. As we have noted, the lodestar was adopted in part because it provides a rough approximation of general billing practices, and accordingly, if hourly billing becomes unusual, an alternative to the lodestar method may have to be found. However, neither respondents nor their amici contend that that day has arrived. Nor have they shown that permitting the award of enhancements on top of the lodestar figure corresponds to prevailing practice in the general run of cases.

We are told that, under an increasingly popular arrangement, attorneys are paid at a reduced hourly rate but receive a bonus if certain specified results are obtained, and this practice is analogized to the award of an enhancement such as the one in this case. Brief for Respondents 55-57. The analogy, however, is flawed. An attorney who agrees, at the outset of the representation, to a reduced hourly rate in exchange for the opportunity to earn a performance bonus is  in a position far different from an attorney in a § 1988 case who is compensated at the full prevailing rate and then seeks a performance enhancement in addition to the lodestar amount after the litigation has concluded. Reliance on these comparisons for the purposes of administering enhancements, therefore, is not appropriate.

V 

In the present case, the District Court did not provide proper justification for the large enhancement that it awarded. The court increased the lodestar award by 75% but, as far as the court's opinion reveals, this figure appears to have been essentially arbitrary. Why, for example, did the court grant a 75% enhancement instead of the 100% increase that respondents sought? And why 75% rather than 50% or 25% or 10%?

The District Court commented that the enhancement was the “minimum enhancement of the lodestar necessary to reasonably compensate [respondents'] counsel.” 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1290. But the effect of the enhancement was to increase the top rate for the attorneys to more than $866 per hour,7Justice Breyer's reliance on the average hourly rate for all of respondents' attorneys is highly misleading. See post, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 516. In calculating the lodestar, the District Court found that the hourly rate for each of these attorneys was “eminently fair and reasonable” and “consistent with the prevailing market rates in Atlanta for comparable work.” 454 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285-1286. Justice Breyer's calculation of an average hourly rate for all attorney hours reflects nothing more than the fact that much of the work was performed by attorneys whose “fair and reasonable” market rate was below the market average. There is nothing unfair about compensating these attorneys at the very rate that they requested. and the District Court did not point to anything in the record that shows that this is an appropriate figure for the relevant market.

The District Court pointed to the fact that respondents' counsel had to make extraordinary outlays for expenses and  had to wait for reimbursement, id., at 1288, but the court did not calculate the amount of the enhancement that is attributable to this factor. Similarly, the District Court noted that respondents' counsel did not receive fees on an ongoing basis while the case was pending, but the court did not sufficiently link this factor to proof in the record that the delay here was outside the normal range expected by attorneys who rely on § 1988 for the payment of their fees or quantify the disparity. Nor did the court provide a calculation of the cost to counsel of any extraordinary and unwarranted delay. And the court's reliance on the contingency of the outcome contravenes our holding in Dague. See 505 U.S., at 565, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449.

Finally, insofar as the District Court relied on a comparison of the performance of counsel in this case with the performance of counsel in unnamed prior cases, the District Court did not employ a methodology that permitted meaningful appellate review. Needless to say, we do not question the sincerity of the District Court's observations, and we are in no position to assess their accuracy. But when a trial judge awards an enhancement on an impressionistic basis, a major purpose of the lodestar method--providing an objective and reviewable basis for fees, see id., at 566, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed.2d 449 --is undermined.

 Determining a “reasonable attorney's fee” is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge, see 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (permitting court, “in its discretion,” to award fees), but the judge's discretion is not unlimited. It is essential that the judge provide a reasonably specific explanation for all aspects of a fee determination, including any award of an enhancement. Unless such an explanation is given, adequate appellate review is not feasible, and without such review, widely disparate awards may be made, and awards may be influenced (or at least, may appear to be influenced) by a judge's subjective opinion regarding particular attorneys or the importance of the case. In addition, in future cases,  defendants contemplating the possibility of settlement will have no way to estimate the likelihood of having to pay a potentially huge enhancement. See Marek v. Chesny,473 U.S. 1, 7, 105 S. Ct. 3012, 87 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985) (“ '[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff ' ”).

Section 1988 serves an important public purpose by making it possible for persons without means to bring suit to vindicate their rights. But unjustified enhancements that serve only to enrich attorneys are not consistent with the statute's aim.8Justice Breyer's opinion dramatically illustrates the danger of allowing a trial judge to award a huge enhancement not supported by any discernible methodology. That approach would retain the $4.5 million enhancement here so that respondents' attorneys would earn as much as the attorneys at some of the richest law firms in the country. Post, at ___-___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 516-517. These fees would be paid by the taxpayers of Georgia, where the annual per capita income is less than $34,000, see Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2010, p. 437 (2009) (Table 665) (figures for 2008), and the annual salaries of attorneys employed by the State range from $48,000 for entry-level lawyers to $118,000 for the highest paid division chief, see Brief for State of Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae, 10, and n. 3 (citing National Association of Attorneys General, Statistics on the Office of the Attorney General, Fiscal Year 2006, pp. 37-39). Section 1988 was enacted to ensure that civil rights plaintiffs are adequately represented, not to provide such a windfall. In many cases, attorney's fees awarded under § 1988are not paid by the individuals responsible for the constitutional or statutory violations on which the judgment is based. Instead, the fees are paid in effect by state and local taxpayers, and because state and local governments have limited budgets, money that is used to pay attorney's fees is money that cannot be used for programs that provide vital public services. Cf. Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 448, 129 S. Ct. 2579, 2594, 174 L. Ed. 2d 406 (2009) (payment of money pursuant to a federal-court order diverts funds from other state or local programs).

* * * 

 For all these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns the timeliness of a complaint filed in a private securities fraud action.  The complaint was timely if filed no more than two years after the plaintiffs “discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b)(1). Construing this limitations statute for the first time, we hold that a cause of action accrues (1) when the plaintiff did in fact discover, or (2) when a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts constituting the violation”--whichever comes first. We also hold that the “facts constituting the violation” include the fact of scienter, “a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,” Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 194, n. 12, 96 S. Ct. 1375, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1976). Applying this standard, we affirm the Court of Appeals' determination that the complaint filed here was timely.

I 

The action before us involves a claim by a group of investors (the plaintiffs, respondents here) that Merck & Co. and others (petitioners here, hereinafter Merck) knowingly misrepresented  the risks of heart attacks accompanying the use of Merck's pain-killing drug, Vioxx (leading to economic losses when the risks later became apparent). The plaintiffs brought an action for securities fraud under § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. See 48 Stat. 891, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR § 240.10b-5(b) (2009); Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-342, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005).

The applicable statute of limitations provides that  a “private right of action” that, like the present action, “involves a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning the securities laws . . . may be brought not later than the earlier of--

“(1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or

“(2) 5 years after such violation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b).

The complaint in this case was filed on November 6, 2003, and no one doubts that it was filed within five years of the alleged violation. Therefore, the critical date for timeliness purposes is November 6, 2001--two years before this complaint was filed. Merck claims that before this date the plaintiffs had (or should have) discovered the “facts constituting the violation.” If so, by the time the plaintiffs filed their complaint, the 2-year statutory period in § 1658(b)(1) had run. The plaintiffs reply that they had not, and could not have, discovered by the critical date those “facts,” particularly not the facts related to scienter, and that their complaint was therefore timely.

A 

We first set out the relevant pre-November 2001 facts, as we have gleaned them from the briefs, the record, and the opinions below.

1. 1990's. In the mid-1990's Merck developed Vioxx. In 1999 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it  for prescription use. Vioxx suppresses pain by inhibiting the body's production of an enzyme called COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2). COX-2 is associated with pain and inflammation. Unlike some other anti-inflammatory drugs in its class like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, Vioxx does not inhibit production of a second enzyme called COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1). COX-1 plays a part in the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract and also in platelet aggregation (associated with blood clots). App. 50-51.

2. March 2000. Merck announced the results of a study, called the “VIGOR” study. Id., at 291-294. The study compared Vioxx with another painkiller, naproxen. The study showed that persons taking Vioxx suffered fewer gastrointestinal side effects (as Merck had hoped). But the study also revealed that approximately 4 out of every 1,000 participants who took Vioxx suffered heart attacks, compared to only 1 per 1,000 participants who took naproxen. Id., at 296, 306; see Bombardier et al., Comparison of Upper Gastrointestinal Toxicity of Rofecoxib and Naproxen in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, 343 New England J. Medicine 1520, 1523, 1526-1527 (2000).

Merck's press release acknowledged VIGOR's adverse cardiovascular data. But Merck said that these data were “consistent with naproxen's ability to block platelet aggregation.” App. 291. Merck noted that, since “Vioxx, like all COX-2 selective medicines, does not block platelet aggregation[, it] would not be expected to have similar effects.” Ibid. And Merck added that “safety data from all other completed and ongoing clinical trials . . . showed no indication of a difference in the incidence of thromboembolic events between Vioxx” and either a placebo or comparable drugs. Id., at 293 (emphasis deleted).

This theory--that VIGOR's troubling cardiovascular findings might be due to the absence of a benefit conferred by naproxen rather than due to a harm caused by Vioxx--later became known as the “naproxen hypothesis.” In advancing  that hypothesis, Merck acknowledged that the naproxen benefit “had not been observed previously.” Id., at 291. Journalists and stock market analysts reported all of the above--the positive gastrointestinal results, the troubling cardiovascular finding, the naproxen hypothesis, and the fact that the naproxen hypothesis was unproved. See id., at 355-391, 508-557.

3. February 2001 to August 2001. Public debate about the naproxen hypothesis continued. In February 2001, the FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee convened to consider Merck's request that the Vioxx label be changed to reflect VIGOR's positive gastrointestinal findings. The VIGOR cardiovascular findings were also discussed. Id., at 392-395, 558-577. In May 2001, a group of plaintiffs filed a products-liability lawsuit against Merck, claiming that “Merck's own research” had demonstrated that “users of Vioxx were four times as likely to suffer heart attacks as compared to other less expensive, medications.” Id., at 869. In August 2001, the Journal of the American Medical Association wrote that the available data raised a “cautionary flag” and strongly urged that “a trial specifically assessing cardiovascular risk” be done. Id., at 331-332; Mukherjee, Nissen, & Topol, Risk of Cardiovascular Events Associated with Selective COX-2 Inhibitors, 286 JAMA 954 (2001). At about the same time, Bloomberg News quoted a Merck scientist who claimed that Merck had “additional data” that were “very, very reassuring,” and Merck issued a press release stating that it stood “behind the overall and cardiovascular safety profile . . . of Vioxx.” App. 434, 120 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).

4. September and October 2001. The FDA sent Merck a warning letter released to the public on September 21, 2001. It said that, in respect to cardiovascular risks, Merck's Vioxx marketing was “false, lacking in fair balance, or otherwise misleading.” Id., at 339. At the same time, the FDA acknowledged that the naproxen hypothesis was a “possible  explanation” of the VIGOR results. Id., at 340. But it found that Merck's “promotional campaign selectively present[ed]” that hypothesis without adequately acknowledging “another reasonable explanation,” namely, “that Vioxx may have pro-thrombotic [i.e., adverse cardiovascular] properties.” Ibid. The FDA ordered Merck to send healthcare providers a corrective letter. Id., at 353.

After the FDA letter was released, more products-liability lawsuits were filed. See id., at 885-956. Merck's share price fell by 6.6% over several days. See id., at 832. By October 1, the price rebounded. See ibid. On October 9, 2001, the New York Times said that Merck had reexamined its own data and “found no evidence that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks.” Id., at 504. It quoted the president of Merck Research Laboratories as positing “ 'two possible interpretations' ”: “ 'Naproxen lowers the heart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.' ” Ibid. Stock analysts, while reporting the warning letter, also noted that the FDA had not denied that the naproxen hypothesis remained an unproven but possible explanation. See id., at 614, 626, 628.

B 

We next set forth three important events that occurred after the critical date.

1. October 2003. The Wall Street Journal published the results of a Merck-funded Vioxx study conducted at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. After examining the medical records of more than 50,000 Medicare patients, researchers found that those given Vioxx for 30 to 90 days were 37% more likely to have suffered a heart attack than those given either a different painkiller or no painkiller at all. Id., at 164-165. (That is to say, if patients given a different painkiller or given no painkiller at all suffered 10 heart attacks, then the same number of patients given Vioxx would suffer 13 or 14 heart attacks.) Merck defended Vioxx and pointed to the study's limitations. Id., at 165-167.

2. September 30, 2004. Merck withdrew Vioxx from the market. It said that a new study had found “an increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events beginning after 18 months of continuous therapy.” Id., at 182 (internal quotation marks omitted). A Merck representative publicly described the results as “totally unexpected.” Id., at 186 (emphasis deleted). Merck's shares fell by 27% the same day. Id., at 185, 856.

3. November 1, 2004. The Wall Street Journal published an article stating that “internal Merck e-mails and marketing materials as well as interviews with outside scientists show that the company fought forcefully for years to keep safety concerns from destroying the drug's commercial prospects.” Id., at 189-190. The article said that an early e-mail from Merck's head of research had said that the VIGOR “results showed that the cardiovascular events 'are clearly there,' ” that it was “ 'a shame but . . . a low incidence,' ” and that it “ 'is mechanism based as we worried it was.' ” Id., at 192. It also said that Merck had given its salespeople instructions to “ 'DODGE' ” questions about Vioxx's cardiovascular effects. Id., at 193.

C 

The plaintiffs filed their complaint on November 6, 2003. As subsequently amended, the complaint alleged that Merck had defrauded investors by promoting the naproxen hypothesis, knowing the hypothesis was false. It said, for example, that Merck “knew, at least as early as 1996, of the serious safety issues with Vioxx,” and that a “1998 internal Merck clinical trial . . . revealed that . . . serious cardiovascular events . . . occurred six times more frequently in patients given Vioxx than in patients given a different arthritis drug or placebo.” Id., at 56, 58-59 (emphasis and capitalization deleted).

Merck, believing that the plaintiffs knew or should have known the “facts constituting the violation” at least two years earlier, moved to dismiss the complaint, saying it was  filed too late. The District Court granted the motion. The court held that the (March 2001) VIGOR study, the (September 2001) FDA warning letter, and Merck's (October 2001) response should have alerted the plaintiffs to a “possibility that Merckhad knowingly misrepresented material facts” no later than October 9, 2001, thus placing the plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” to look further. In re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & "ERISA" Litigation, 483 F. Supp. 2d 407, 423 (NJ 2007) (emphasis added). Finding that the plaintiffs had failed to “show that they exercised reasonable due diligence but nevertheless were unable to discover their injuries,” the court took October 9, 2001, as the date that the limitations period began to run and therefore found the complaint untimely. Id., at 424.

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. A majority held that the pre-November 2001 events, while constituting “storm warning[s],” did not suggest much by way of scienter, and consequently did not put the plaintiffs on “inquiry notice,” requiring them to investigate further. In re Merck & Co. Securities, Derivative & "ERISA" Litigation, 543 F.3d 150, 172 (2008). A dissenting judge considered the pre-November 2001 events sufficient to start the 2-year clock running. Id., at 173 (opinion of Roth, J.).

Merck sought review in this Court, pointing to disagreements among the Courts of Appeals. Compare Theoharous v. Fong, 256 F.3d 1219, 1228 (CA11 2001)(limitations period begins to run when information puts plaintiffs on “inquiry notice” of the need for investigation), with Shah v. Meeker, 435 F.3d 244, 249 (CA2 2006) (same; but if plaintiff does investigate, period runs “from the date such inquiry should have revealed the fraud” (internal quotation marks omitted)), and New England Health Care Employees Pension Fund v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 336 F.3d 495, 501 (CA6 2003) (limitations period always begins to run only when a reasonably diligent plaintiff, after being put on “inquiry notice,”  should have discovered facts constituting violation (internal quotation marks omitted)). We granted Merck's petition.

II 

Before turning to Merck's arguments, we consider a more basic matter. The parties and the Solicitor General agree that § 1658(b)(1)'s word “discovery” refers not only to a plaintiff's actual discovery of certain facts, but also to the facts that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered. We agree. But because the statute's language does not make this interpretation obvious, and because we cannot answer the question presented without considering whether the parties are right about this matter, we set forth the reasons for our agreement in some detail.

We recognize that one might read the statutory words “after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation” as referring to the time a plaintiff actually discovered the relevant facts. But  in the statute of limitations context, the word “discovery” is often used as a term of art in connection with the “discovery rule,” a doctrine that delays accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff has “discovered” it. The rule arose in fraud cases as an exception to the general limitations rule that a cause of action accrues once a plaintiff has a “complete and present cause of action,” Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., 522 U.S. 192, 201, 118 S. Ct. 542, 139 L. Ed. 2d 553 (1997) (citing Clark v. Iowa City, 87 U.S. 583, 20 Wall. 583, 589, 22 L. Ed. 427 (1875); internal quotation marks omitted). This Court long ago recognized that something different was needed in the case of fraud, where a defendant's deceptive conduct may prevent a plaintiff from even knowing that he or she has been defrauded. Otherwise, “the law which was designed to prevent fraud” could become “the means by which it is made successful and secure.” Bailey v. Glover, 88 U.S. 342, 21 Wall. 342, 349, 22 L. Ed. 636 (1875). Accordingly, “where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part, the bar of  the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 397, 66 S. Ct. 582, 90 L. Ed. 743 (1946) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). And for more than a century, courts have understood that “[f]raud is deemed to be discovered . . . when, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, it could have been discovered.” 2 H. Wood, Limitation of Actions § 276b(11), p. 1402 (4th ed. 1916); see id., at 1401-1403, and nn. 74-84 (collecting cases and statutes); see, e.g., Holmberg, supra, at 397, 66 S. Ct. 582, 90 L. Ed. 743; Kirby v. Lake S. & M. S. Railroad, 120 U.S. 130, 138, 7 S. Ct. 430, 30 L. Ed. 569 (1887) (The rule “regard[s] the cause of action as having accrued at the time the fraud was or should have been discovered”).

More recently, both state and federal courts have applied forms of the “discovery rule” to claims other than fraud. See 2 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions §§ 11.1.2.1, 11.1.2.3, pp. 136-142, and nn. 6-13, 18-23 (1991 and 1993 Supp.) (hereinafter Corman) (collecting cases); see, e.g., United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 100 S. Ct. 352, 62 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1979). Legislatures have codified the discovery rule in various contexts. 2 Corman § 11.2, at 170-171, and nn. 1-9 (collecting statutes); see, e.g.,28 U.S.C. § 2409a(g) (actions to quiet title against the United States). In doing so, legislators have written the word “discovery” directly into the statute. And when they have done so, state and federal courts have typically interpreted the word to refer not only to actual discovery, but also to the hypothetical discovery of facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would know. See, e.g., Peacock v. Barnes, 142 N. C. 215, 217-220, 55 S. E. 99, 100 (1906); Davis v. Hibernia Sav. & Loan Soc., 21 Cal. App. 444, 448, 132 P. 462, 464 (1913); Roether v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 51 N. D. 634, 640-642, 200 N. W. 818, 821 (1924); Goldenberg v. Bache & Co., 270 F.2d 675, 681 (CA5 1959); Mobley v. Hall, 202 Mont. 227, 232, 657 P.2d 604, 606 (1983); Tregenza v. Great American Communications Co., 12 F.3d 717, 721-722 (CA7 1993); J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1254 (CA1 1996).

  Thus, treatise writers now describe  “the discovery rule” as allowing a claim “to accrue when the litigant first knows or with due diligence should know facts that will form the basis for an action.” 2 Corman § 11.1.1, at 134 (emphasis added); see also ibid., n. 1 (collecting cases); 37 Am. Jur. 2d, Fraud and Deceit § 347, p. 354 (2001 and Supp. 2009) (noting that the various formulations of “discovery” all provide that “in addition to actual knowledge of the fraud, once a reasonably diligent party is in a position that they should have sufficient knowledge or information to have actually discovered the fraud, they are charged with discovery”); id., at 354-355, and nn. 2-11 (collecting cases).

Like the parties, we believe that Congress intended courts to interpret the word “discovery” in § 1658(b)(1) similarly. Before Congress enacted that statute, this Court, having found in the federal securities laws the existence of an implied private § 10(b) action, determined its governing limitations period by looking to other limitations periods in the federal securities laws. Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1991). Noting the existence of various formulations “differ[ing] slightly in terminology,” the Court chose the language in 15 U.S.C. § 78i(e), the statutory provision that governs securities price manipulation claims. 501 U.S., at 364, n. 9, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321. And in doing so, the Court said that private § 10(b) actions “must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.” Id., at 364, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321 (emphasis added). (The Court listed among the various formulations the one in 15 U.S.C. § 77m, on which the concurrence relies. See post, at 656-658, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 601-602 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Lampf, supra, at 360, and n. 7, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321 (quoting § 77m).)

Subsequently, every Court of Appeals to decide the matter held that “discovery of the facts constituting the violation” occurs not only once a plaintiff actually discovers the facts, but also when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff  would have discovered them. See, e.g., Law v. Medco Research, Inc., 113 F.3d 781, 785-786 (CA7 1997); Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., 12 F.3d 346, 350, 353 (CA2 1993); see In re NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F.3d 1314, 1325, n. 4 (CA3 2002) (collecting cases). Some of those courts noted that other limitations provisions in the federal securities laws explicitly provide that the period begins to run “ 'after the discovery of the untrue statement . . . or after such discovery should have been made by [the] exercise of reasonable diligence,' ” whereas the formulation adopted by the Court in Lampf from 15 U.S.C. § 78i(e) does not. Tregenza, supra, at 721 (quoting § 77m; emphasis added in Tregenza); see Lampf, supra, at 364, n. 9, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321. But, courts reasoned, because the term “discovery” in respect to statutes of limitations for fraud has long been understood to include discoveries a reasonably diligent plaintiff would make, the omission of an explicit provision to that effect did not matter. Tregenza, supra, at 721; accord, New England Health Care,336 F.3d at 499-500.

 In 2002, when Congress enacted the present limitations statute, it repeated Lampf's critical language. The statute says that  an action based on fraud “may be brought not later than the earlier of . . . 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation” (or “5 years after such violation”). § 804 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 116 Stat. 801, codified at 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b) (emphasis added). (This statutory provision does not make the linguistic distinction that the concurrence finds in a different statute, § 77m, and upon which its argument rests. Cf. 29 U.S.C. § 1113(2) (statute in which Congress provided that an action be brought “three years after the earliest date on which the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the breach or violation” (emphasis added)).) Not surprisingly, the Courts of Appeals unanimously have continued to interpret the word “discovery” in this statute as including not only facts a particular plaintiff knows, but also the facts any reasonably diligent plaintiff would know.  See, e.g., Staehr v. Hartford Financial Servs. Group, Inc., 547 F.3d 406, 411 (CA2 2008); Sudo Properties, Inc. v. Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Govt., 503 F.3d 371, 376 (CA5 2007).

 We normally assume that, when Congress enacts statutes, it is aware of relevant judicial precedent. See, e.g., Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 535 U.S. 106, 116-117, and n. 13, 122 S. Ct. 1145, 152 L. Ed. 2d 188 (2002); Commissioner v. Keystone Consol. Industries, Inc., 508 U.S. 152, 159, 113 S. Ct. 2006, 124 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1993). Given the history and precedent surrounding the use of the word “discovery” in the limitations context generally as well as in this provision in particular, the reasons for making this assumption are particularly strong here. We consequently hold that  “discovery” as used in this statute encompasses not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew, but also those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known. And we evaluate Merck's claims accordingly.

III 

We turn now to Merck's arguments in favor of holding that petitioners' claims accrued before November 6, 2001. First, Merck argues that the statute does not require “discovery” of scienter-related “facts.” See Brief for Petitioners 19-28. We cannot agree, however, that facts about scienter are unnecessary.

 The statute says that the limitations period does not begin to run until “discovery of the facts constituting the violation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1658(b)(1) (emphasis added). Scienter is assuredly a “fact.” In a § 10(b) action, scienter refers to “a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Ernst & Ernst, 425 U.S., at 194, n. 12, 96 S. Ct. 1375, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668. And the “ 'state of a man's mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion.' Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 75 L. Ed. 2d 403 (1983) (quoting Edgington v. Fitzmaurice, [1885] 29 Ch. Div. 459, 483).

And this “fact” of scienter “constitut[es]” an important and necessary element of a § 10(b) “violation.” A plaintiff cannot  recover without proving that a defendant made a material misstatement with an intent to deceive--not merely innocently or negligently. See Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 319, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007); Ernst & Ernst, supra. Indeed, Congress has enacted special heightened pleading requirements for the scienter element of § 10(b) fraud cases. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring plaintiffs to “state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind” (emphasis added)). As a result, unless a § 10(b) plaintiff can set forth facts in the complaint showing that it is “at least as likely as” not that the defendant acted with the relevant knowledge or intent, the claim will fail. Tellabs, supra, at 328, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (emphasis deleted). It would therefore frustrate the very purpose of the discovery rule in this provision--which, after all, specifically applies only in cases “involv[ing] a claim of fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance,” § 1658(b) --if the limitations period began to run regardless of whether a plaintiff had discovered any facts suggesting scienter. So long as a defendant concealed for two years that he made a misstatement with an intent to deceive, the limitations period would expire before the plaintiff had actually “discover[ed]” the fraud.

We consequently hold that facts showing scienter are among those that “constitut[e] the violation.” In so holding, we say nothing about other facts necessary to support a private § 10(b) action. Cf. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12, n. 1 (suggesting that facts concerning a plaintiff's reliance, loss, and loss causation are not among those that constitute “the violation” and therefore need not be “discover[ed]” for a claim to accrue).

Second, Merck argues that, even if “discovery” requires facts related to scienter, facts that tend to show a materially false or misleading statement (or material omission) are ordinarily sufficient to show scienter as well. See Brief for Petitioners 22, 28-29. But we do not see how that is so. We  recognize that certain statements are such that, to show them false is normally to show scienter as well. It is unlikely, for example, that someone would falsely say “I am not married” without being aware of the fact that his statement is false.  Where § 10(b) is at issue, however, the relation of factual falsity and state of mind is more context specific. An incorrect prediction about a firm's future earnings, by itself, does not automatically tell us whether the speaker deliberately lied or just made an innocent (and therefore nonactionable) error. Hence, the statute may require “discovery” of scienter-related facts beyond the facts that show a statement (or omission) to be materially false or misleading. Merck fears that this requirement will give life to stale claims or subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago. But Congress' inclusion in the statute of an unqualified bar on actions instituted “5 years after such violation,” § 1658(b)(2), giving defendants total repose after five years, should diminish that fear. Cf. Lampf, 501 U.S., at 363, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321 (holding comparable bar not subject to equitable tolling).

Third, Merck says that the limitations period began to run prior to November 2001 because by that point the plaintiffs were on “inquiry notice.” Merck uses the term “inquiry notice” to refer to the point “at which a plaintiff possesses a quantum of information sufficiently suggestive of wrongdoing that he should conduct a further inquiry.” Brief for Petitioners 20. And some, but not all, Courts of Appeals have used the term in roughly similar ways. See, e.g., Franze v. Equitable Assurance, 296 F.3d 1250, 1254 (CA11 2002) (“[I]nquiry notice [is] 'the term used for knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person to begin investigating the possibility that his legal rights had been infringed' ”). Cf. Dodds, 12 F.3d at 350 (“duty of inquiry” arises once “circumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability that she had been defrauded”); Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. v. Kapoor, 115 F.3d 1332, 1335-1336 (CA7 1997) (“The facts constituting [inquiry] notice must be sufficien[t] . . . to incite the victim to investigate” and “to enable him to tie up any loose ends and complete the investigation in time to file a timely suit”); Great Rivers Cooperative of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland Industries, Inc., 120 F.3d 893, 896 (CA8 1997) (“Inquiry notice exists when the victim is aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to investigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of the defendant's misrepresentations” (emphasis added)).

 If the term “inquiry notice” refers to the point where the facts would lead a reasonably diligent plaintiff to investigate further, that point is not necessarily the point at which the plaintiff would already have discovered facts showing scienter or other “facts constituting the violation.” But the statute says that the plaintiff's claim accrues only after the “discovery” of those latter facts. Nothing in the text suggests that the limitations period can sometimes begin before “discovery” can take place. Merck points out that, as we have discussed, see supra, at 644-645, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 593-594, the court-created “discovery rule” exception to ordinary statutes of limitations is not generally available to plaintiffs who fail to pursue their claims with reasonable diligence. But we are dealing here with a statute, not a court-created exception to a statute. Because the statute contains no indication that the limitations period should occur at some earlier moment before “discovery,” when a plaintiff would have begun investigating, we cannot accept Merck's argument.

As a fallback, Merck argues that even if the limitations period does generally begin at “discovery,” it should nonetheless run from the point of “inquiry notice” in one particular situation, namely, where the actual plaintiff fails to undertake an investigation once placed on “inquiry notice.” In such circumstances, Merck contends, the actual plaintiff is not diligent, and the law should not “effectively excuse a  plaintiff's failure to conduct a further investigation” by placing that nondiligent plaintiff and a reasonably diligent plaintiff “in the same position.” Brief for Petitioners 48.

We cannot accept this argument for essentially the same reason we reject “inquiry notice” as the standard generally: We cannot reconcile it with  the statute, which simply provides that “discovery” is the event that triggers the 2-year limitations period--for all plaintiffs. Cf. United States v. Mack, 295 U.S. 480, 489, 55 S. Ct. 813, 79 L. Ed. 1559 (1935) (“Laches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law”). Furthermore, the statute does not place all plaintiffs “in the same position” no matter whether they investigate when investigation is warranted. The limitations period puts plaintiffs who fail to investigate once on “inquiry notice” at a disadvantage because it lapses two years after a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the necessary facts. A plaintiff who fails entirely to investigate or delays investigating may well not have discovered those facts by that time or, at least, may not have found sufficient facts by that time to be able to file a § 10(b) complaint that satisfies the applicable heightened pleading standards. Cf. Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d 1, 9 (CA1 2002) (“[A] reasonably diligent investigation . . . may consume as little as a few days or as much as a few years to get to the bottom of the matter”).

Merck further contends that its proposed “inquiry notice” standard is superior, because determining when a hypothetical reasonably diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed]” the necessary facts is too complicated for judges to undertake. But courts applying the traditional discovery rule have long had to ask what a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known and done in myriad circumstances. And courts in at least five Circuits already ask this kind of question in securities fraud cases. See, e.g., Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 97 (CA2 2000); New England Health Care,336 F.3d at 501; Young, supra, at 9-10; Sterlin v. Biomune Systems, 154 F.3d 1191, 1201 (CA10 1998); Marks v. CDW Computer  Centers, Inc., 122 F.3d 363, 367-368 (CA7 1997). Merck has not shown this precedent to be unworkable. We consequently find that  the “discovery” of facts that put a plaintiff on “inquiry notice” does not automatically begin the running of the limitations period.

We conclude that the limitations period in § 1658(b)(1) begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have “discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation”--whichever comes first. In determining the time at which “discovery” of those “facts” occurred, terms such as “inquiry notice” and “storm warnings” may be useful to the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating. But the limitations period does not begin to run until the plaintiff thereafter discovers or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered “the facts constituting the violation,” including scienter--irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.

IV 

Finally, Merck argues that, even if all its other legal arguments fail, the record still shows that, before November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs had discovered or should have discovered “the facts constituting the violation.” In respect to scienter Merck primarily relies upon (1) the FDA's September 2001 warning letter, which said that Merck had “ 'minimized' ” the VIGOR study's “ 'potentially serious cardiovascular findings' ” and (2) pleadings filed in products-liability actions in September and October 2001 alleging that Merck had “ 'omitted, suppressed, or concealed material facts concerning the dangers and risks associated with Vioxx' ” and “ 'purposefully downplayed and/or understated the serious nature of the risks associated with Vioxx.' ” Brief for Petitioners 36-37 (quoting App. 340, 893).

The FDA's warning letter, however, shows little or nothing about the here-relevant scienter, i.e., whether Merck  advanced the naproxen hypothesis with fraudulent intent. See Part I-A(4), supra. The FDA itself described the pro-Vioxx naproxen hypothesis as a “possible explanation” for the VIGOR results, faulting Merck only for failing sufficiently to publicize the alternative less favorable to Merck, that Vioxx might be harmful. App. 340.

The products-liability complaints' statements about Merck's knowledge show little more. See Part I-A(3), supra. Merck does not claim that these complaints contained any specific information suggesting the fraud alleged here, i.e., that Merck knew the naproxen hypothesis was false even as it promoted it. And, without providing any reason to believe that the plaintiffs had special access to information about Merck's state of mind, the complaints alleged only in general terms that Merck had concealed information about Vioxx and “purposefully downplayed and/or understated” the risks associated with Vioxx--the same charge made in the FDA warning letter. App. 893.

In our view, neither these two circumstances nor any of the other pre-November 2001 circumstances that we have set forth in Part I-A, supra, whether viewed separately or together, reveal “facts” indicating scienter. Regardless of which, if any, of the events following November 6, 2001, constituted “discovery,” we need only conclude that prior to November 6, 2001, the plaintiffs did not discover, and Merck has not shown that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered, “the facts constituting the violation.” In light of our interpretation of the statute, our holdings in respect to scienter, and our application of those holdings to the circumstances of this case, we must, and we do, reach that conclusion. Thus, the plaintiffs' suit is timely. We need not--and do not--pass upon the Court of Appeals' suggestion that the November 2003 Brigham and Women's study might have triggered the statute of limitations. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Court must interpret, once again, § 924(c) of Title 18 of the United States Code.  This provision prohibits the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or the possession of a firearm in furtherance of such crimes. § 924(c)(1)(A). A violation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum term of five years' imprisonment, § 924(c)(1)(A)(i); but if the firearm is a machinegun, the statute requires a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence, § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii). Whether a firearm was used, carried, or possessed is, as all concede, an element of the offense. At issue here is whether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an element to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at sentencing.

In an earlier case the Court determined that an analogous machinegun provision in a previous version of § 924 constituted an element of an offense to be proved to the jury. Castillo v. United States, 530 U.S. 120, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94 (2000). The Castillo decision, however, addressed the statute as it existed before congressional amendments made in 1998. And in a case after Castillo, the brandishing provision in the post-1998 version of § 924 was held to provide a sentencing factor, not an element of the offense. Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524 (2002). In light of the 1998 amendments and the Harris decision, the question of how to interpret § 924's machinegun provision is considered once more in the instant case.

I 

On June 16, 2005, respondents Martin O'Brien and Arthur Burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a scheduled delivery of cash to a bank. Along with a third collaborator, respondents hid in a minivan and waited for the armored car to make its stop. Each of the men carried a firearm. Containing nearly $2 million and attended by two guards, the armored car arrived. A guard began to unload  boxes of coins. The three men came out of the van and, while one of them brandished his weapon, they ordered the guards to get on the ground. One guard did so, but the other ran to a nearby restaurant. The Respondents abandoned the robbery and fled without taking any money. No shots were fired, and no one was injured.

Authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the three firearms used during the attempted robbery. The firearms were a semiautomatic Sig-Sauer pistol, an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle, and a Cobray pistol. The Cobray pistol had been manufactured as, and had the external appearance of, a semiautomatic firearm. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, though, it operated as a fully automatic weapon, apparently due to some alteration of its original firing mechanism. Respondents dispute whether the Cobray in fact did operate as a fully automatic weapon.

Respondents were indicted on multiple counts. Relevant here are counts three and four, both of which charged offenses under § 924(c). Count three charged respondents with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which carries a statutory minimum of five years' imprisonment. Count four charged respondents in more specific terms, alleging use of a machinegun (the Cobray) in furtherance of a crime of violence, as proscribed by §§ 924(c)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The latter provision mandates a minimum sentence of 30 years' imprisonment.

The Government moved to dismiss count four on the basis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond a reasonable doubt. (The issues in the present case do not require the Court to consider any contention that a defendant who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm must be aware of the weapon's characteristics. This opinion expresses no views on the point.)

The Government then maintained that the machinegun provision in § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was a sentencing factor, so that, if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm under  count three, the court could determine at sentencing that the particular firearm was a machinegun, thus activating the 30-year mandatory minimum. The District Court dismissed count four, as the Government requested, but rejected the Government's position that the machinegun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be determined by the court at sentencing once there was a conviction on count three. It ruled that the machinegun provision states an element of a crime. Thus, to invoke the 30-year minimum sentence, the Government was required to charge in the indictment, and then prove to the jury, that the Cobray was a machinegun.

At this point, after the District Court foreclosed the possibility of respondents' facing a 30-year minimum, respondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, including count three. The District Court sentenced O'Brien to a 102-month term for his § 924(c) conviction, to run consecutively with his sentence on two other counts. It sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his § 924(c) conviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the other charges. The Government appealed the District Court's ruling that the § 924 machinegun provision constitutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing factor.

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U.S. 120, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94, which held that the machinegun provision in an earlier version of § 924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not a sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute under consideration in Castillo had been revised by Congress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into subparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier repealed version of the statute was “slightly more favorable to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but not markedly so.” 542 F.3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no evidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the present subdivisions or recasting of language was anything more than a current trend--probably for ease of reading--to convert lengthy sentences  in criminal statutes into subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at 926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dramatic change in language or legislative history expressing a specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think that Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration of the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S. Ct. 1917, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions”).

We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 966 , 130 S. Ct. 49, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).

 II 

 Elements of a crime must be charged in an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S. Ct. 2887, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1974); Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1999). Sentencing factors, on the other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 91-92, 106 S. Ct. 2411, 91 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1986). Though one exception has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1998), “ '[i]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.' Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (quoting Jones, supra, at 252-253, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (Stevens, J., concurring)). In other words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine a judge's discretion in sentencing an offender “within the range prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, judge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maximum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based purely on the facts found by the jury.

 Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a given fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing factor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not explicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly addresses the distinction between sentencing factors and elements, courts look to the provisions and the framework of the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or a sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350. In examining whether the machinegun provision in § 924 is an element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin with this Court's previous examination of the question in Castillo.

In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of § 924, which provided:

“(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years, and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short-barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device, or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).

In determining whether the machinegun provision in the just-quoted version of § 924 constituted an element or a sentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the bare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U.S., at 124, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94. It examined five factors directed at determining congressional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5) legislative history. Id., at 124-131, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94. The Court unanimously concluded that the machinegun provision provided an element of an offense, noting that the first four factors favored treating it  as such while legislative history did not significantly favor either side. Ibid.

 III

A 

Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998. The amendment had been enacted when the Court considered Castillo, supra, at 125, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94, but the pre-1998 version of the statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns the post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which provides:

 “(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime--“(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;“(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and“(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.“(B) If the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of this subsection--“(i) is a short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, or semiautomatic assault weapon, the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years; or“(ii) is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 30 years.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (2006 ed.).

 The 1998 amendment did make substantive changes to the statute, to be discussed below; but for purposes of the present case the most apparent effect of the amendment was to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. This Court's observation in considering the first Castillo factor, that “Congress placed the element 'uses or carries a firearm' and the word 'machinegun' in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or separated into subsections,” 530 U.S., at 124-125, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94, no longer holds true. Aside from this new structure, however, the 1998 amendment of § 924 did nothing to affect the second through fifth Castillo factors. Each of the factors, except for legislative history (which, assuming its relevance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the conclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of an offense.

 Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the second Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when, as here, a statute's text is unclear as to whether certain facts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentencing factors traditionally involve characteristics of the offender--such as recidivism, cooperation with law enforcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94. Characteristics of the offense itself are traditionally treated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under § 924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id., at 127, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago in Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an element in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes make substantive distinctions between weapons such as pistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g.,18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).

The Government counters that this tradition or pattern has evolved since the version of § 924(c) under review in Castillo was enacted. The Government contends that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by treating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor. Brief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov. 1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a firearm”)).

The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the version of § 924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, § 6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the resulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was still before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in Castillo, and 13 years before this Court's conclusion in Castillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an offense element. The Government cannot claim the benefit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm type from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would have occurred before the 1988 version of § 924 was enacted. The Guidelines were explicitly taken into account when this Court analyzed the traditions in Castillo. 530 U.S., at 126, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94 (discussing Federal Sentencing Guidelines in determining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing factor).

The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was unchanged by the restructuring of § 924. The Court explained in Castillo that treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor “might unnecessarily produce a conflict between the judge and the jury” because “a jury may well have to decide which of several weapons” a defendant used. Id., at 128, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94. The concern was that the judge may not know which weapon the jurors determined a defendant used, and “a judge's later, sentencing-related decision that the defendant used the machinegun, rather than, say, the pistol, might conflict with the jury's belief that he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern arises under the current version of § 924, where jurors might have to determine which among several weapons a defendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a crime.

 The Government's response, that permitting a judge to make this finding would “streamlin[e] guilt-stage proceedings, without interfering with the accuracy of fact-finding,” Brief for United States 33, is unconvincing. It does not address the particular unfairness concern expressed in Castillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of § 924. And the Government does not suggest that it would be subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision continues to be treated as an element.

The fourth Castillo factor, the severity of the sentence accompanying a finding that a defendant carried a machinegun under § 924, was also unaffected by the statute's restructuring.  A finding that a defendant carried a machinegun under § 924, in contrast to some less dangerous firearm, vaults a defendant's mandatory minimum sentence from 5 to 30 years, Castillo, supra, at 131, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94, or from 7 to 30 years if, as in this case, the firearm was brandished, § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). This is not akin to the “incremental changes in the minimum” that one would “expect to see in provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing judge's consideration,” Harris, 536 U.S., at 554, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524 (from 5 years to 7 years); it is a drastic, sixfold increase that strongly suggests a separate substantive crime.

There is one substantive difference between the old and new versions of § 924 that might bear on this fourth factor. The previous version of § 924 provided mandatory sentences: 5 years for using or carrying a firearm and 30 years if the firearm is a machinegun, for example. See § 924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The current statute provides only mandatory minimums: not less than 5 years for using or possessing a firearm; not less than 7 for brandishing it; and not less than 30 if the firearm is a machinegun. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (B)(ii). The Government argues that this difference is critical because a 30-year sentence is conceivable under the statute even without a finding that the particular weapon is a machinegun. Brief for United States 25.

 This is a distinction in theory, perhaps, but not in practice. Neither the Government nor any party or amicus has identified a single defendant whose conviction under § 924 for possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a sentence approaching the 30-year sentence that is required when the firearm is a machinegun. Respondents advise, without refutation, that most courts impose the mandatory minimum of 7 years' imprisonment for brandishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence that has come to the litigants' or the Court's attention is 14 years. Brief for Respondent O'Brien 46, 48 (citing United States v. Batts, 317 Fed. Appx. 329 (CA4 2009)(per curiam)); see also Harris, supra, at 578, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Indeed, in the instant case, Burgess received the statutory minimum 7-year sentence, and O'Brien received only 18 months more than that. Once the machinegun enhancement was off the table, the Government itself did not seek anything approaching 30-year terms, instead requesting 12-year terms for each respondent.

The immense danger posed by machineguns, the moral depravity in choosing the weapon, and the substantial increase in the minimum sentence provided by the statute support the conclusion that this prohibition is an element of the crime, not a sentencing factor. It is not likely that Congress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial protections when it provided for such an extreme sentencing increase. See Jones, 526 U.S., at 233, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311 (“It is at best questionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to increase a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15 years to life, was meant to carry none of the process safeguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a defendant's benefit”). Perhaps Congress was not concerned with parsing the distinction between elements and sentencing factors, a matter more often discussed by the courts when discussing the proper allocation of functions between judge and jury. Instead, it likely was more focused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory minimum sentences. But the severity  of the increase in this case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is an element, at least absent some clear congressional indication to the contrary.

The fifth factor considered in Castillo was legislative history, and the Court there found it to be of little help. 530 U.S., at 130, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94 (“Insofar as this history may be relevant, however, it does not significantly help the Government”). The 1998 amendment has its own legislative record, discussed below, but the parties accurately observe that it is silent as to congressional consideration of the distinction between elements and sentencing factors. Brief for United States 29; Brief for Respondent O'Brien 28-29. This silence is not neutral, however, because as explained below, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress made a substantive change to this statutory provision.

Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo point in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How the 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor--the provision's language and structure--requires closer examination.

B 

In Castillo, the Court interpreted § 924(c) in its original version, though Congress had at that point already amended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is that Congress does not enact substantive changes sub silentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB, 531 U.S. 316, 323, 121 S. Ct. 941, 148 L. Ed. 2d 830 (2001). In light of Castillo's determination that the machinegun provision in the previous version of § 924 is an element, a change should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in policy.” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 290, 111 S. Ct. 654, 112 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1991); see also Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U.S. 298, 313, n. 12, 114 S. Ct. 1510, 128 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1994) (“[W]hen this Court construes a statute, it is explaining its understanding of what the statute has meant continuously since the date when it became law”).

 The Government argues that the 1998 amendment restructuring § 924(c) demonstrates the congressional judgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor, rather than as an offense element. But the better understanding, as the Government acknowledged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is nothing to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to change, rather than simply reorganize and clarify, [ § 924]'s treatment of firearm type.” Brief for United States, O. T. 1999, No. 99-658, p. 41. A closer review of the 1998 amendment confirms this.

There are three principal differences between the previous and current versions of § 924(c): two substantive changes and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the statute. The first difference, as discussed above, supra, at ----, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 990, is that the amendment changed what were once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences. A person convicted of the primary offense of using or carrying a firearm during a crime of violence was once to “be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,” but under the current version he or she is to “be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years.”

The second difference is that the amended version includes the word “possesses” in addition to “uses or carries” in its principal paragraph, and then adds the substantive provisions in §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which provide mandatory minimums for brandishing (7 years) and discharging (10 years) the firearm. These provisions are new substantive additions to the text of the previous version, which provided a bare 5-year mandatory minimum for any offender who “use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm,” without concern for how the firearm was used.

The changes were a direct response to this Court's decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1995), which held that the word “use” in the preamendment version of § 924 “must connote more than mere possession of a firearm by a person who commits a drug offense.” Id., at 143, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472.  The Court in Bailey went on to observe that, “[h]ad Congress intended possession alone to trigger liability under § 924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided” by using the word “possess,” as it had so frequently done in other statutory provisions. Ibid. Three years later, Congress made the change and added the word “possesses” to the principal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory sentences above the 5-year minimum depending on whether and how the firearm was used. Sections 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court has held that these enhancements are sentencing factors to be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U.S., at 552-556, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524; see also Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. ___, ___ , 556 U.S. 568, 129 S. Ct. 1849, 173 L. Ed. 2d 785, 793 (2009) (referring to the brandishing and discharge provisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment was colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong. Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also Dean, supra, at ___, 129 S. Ct. 1849, 173 L. Ed. 2d 785, 796 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to mandatory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left the substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these substantive changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun provision from an element into a sentencing factor.

The Government stresses a third, structural, difference in the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision now resides in a separate subparagraph, § 924(c)(1)(B), whereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or stylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of machineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U.S., at 290, 111 S. Ct. 654, 112 L. Ed. 2d 755. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is that it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which exceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the Bailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step with current legislative drafting  guidelines, which advise drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate subsections that can be read more easily. See House Legislative Counsel's Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104.1, § 312, pp. 23-25 (1995); Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual § 112, pp. 10-11 (1997).

 While the Court has indicated that placing factors in separate subsections is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentencing factors as opposed to elements, Castillo, 530 U.S., at 124-125, 120 S. Ct. 2090, 147 L. Ed. 2d 94, Harris, 536 U.S., at 552-553, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524, it has rejected the view that this structural consideration predominates even when other factors point in the other direction, id., at 553, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524 (“[E]ven if a statute 'has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections are only sentencing provisions,' ” the Court will not ignore “compelling evidence to the contrary” (quoting Jones, 526 U.S., at 232, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311)). For instance, in Jones the Court found that the federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multiple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at issue here. Id., at 232-239, 119 S. Ct. 1215, 143 L. Ed. 2d 311. And in Harris, the Court was careful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other Castillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpretation implied by the statute's structure.” 536 U.S., at 553, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524.

In examining the amended version of § 924(c)'s structure, there is an additional consideration that supports interpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense element. As explained above, the brandishing and discharge provisions codified in § 924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state sentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552-556; Dean, supra, at ___ , 129 S. Ct. 1849, 173 L. Ed. 2d 785, 793. Had Congress intended to treat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would have listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of subparagraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subparagraph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing factors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving firearm type as an element of a separate offense.

 To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treating the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The current structure of § 924(c) is more favorable to that interpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now positioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii), see Harris, supra, at 552-556, 122 S. Ct. 2406, 153 L. Ed. 2d 524, and the recidivist provisions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing factors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.S., at 230, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L. Ed. 2d 350. These points are overcome, however, by the substantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear indication of its purpose to do so. The evident congressional purpose was to amend the statute to counteract Bailey and to make the statute more readable but not otherwise to alter the substance of the statute. The analysis and holding of Castillo control this case. The machinegun provision in § 924(c)(1)(B)(ii) is an element of an offense.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

From 1980 to 1986 petitioner Mohamed Ali Samantar was the First Vice President and Minister of Defense of Somalia, and from 1987 to 1990 he served as its Prime Minister. Respondents are natives of Somalia who allege that they, or members of their families, were the victims of torture and extrajudicial killings during those years. They seek damages from petitioner based on his alleged authorization of those acts. The narrow question we must decide is whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA or Act), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1602 et seq., provides petitioner with immunity from suit based on actions taken in his official capacity. We hold that the FSIA does not govern the determination of petitioner's immunity from suit.

I 

Respondents are members of the Isaaq clan, which included well-educated and prosperous Somalis who were subjected to systematic persecution during the 1980's by the military regime then governing Somalia. They allege that petitioner exercised command and control over members of the Somali military forces who tortured, killed, or arbitrarily detained them or members of their families; that petitioner knew or should have known of the abuses perpetrated by his subordinates; and that he aided and abetted the commission of these abuses.1Although we do not set out respondents' allegations in detail, the District Court's written opinion contains a comprehensive summary, describing not only the abuses respondents suffered but also the historical context in which the abuses occurred, as well as some of the attempts to establish a stable government in Somalia in recent years. See No. 1:04cv1360, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56227 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-43a. Respondents' complaint sought damages from petitioner pursuant to the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, 106 Stat. 73, note following 28 U.S.C. § 1350, and the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350. Petitioner, who was in charge of Somalia's Armed Forces before its military  regime collapsed, fled Somalia in 1991 and is now a resident of Virginia. The United States has not recognized any entity as the government of Somalia since the fall of the military regime. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4.

Respondents filed their complaint in November 2004, and petitioner promptly moved to dismiss. The District Court stayed the proceedings to give the State Department an opportunity to provide a statement of interest regarding petitioner's claim of sovereign immunity. Each month during the ensuing two years, petitioner advised the court that the State Department had the matter “ 'still under consideration.' No. 1:04cv1360, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56227 (ED Va., Aug. 1, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a. In 2007, having received no response from the State Department, the District Court reinstated the case on its active docket. The court concluded that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and granted petitioner's motion to dismiss.

The District Court's decision rested squarely on the FSIA.2Petitioner argued that, in addition to his immunity under the FSIA, the complaint should be dismissed on a number of other grounds, which the District Court did not reach. See id., at 45a, n. 11. The FSIA provides that a “foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction” of both federal and state courts except as provided in the Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1604, and the District Court noted that none of the parties had argued that any exception was applicable, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a. Although characterizing the statute as silent on its applicability to the officials of a foreign state, the District Court followed appellate decisions holding that a foreign state's sovereign immunity under the Act extends to “ 'an individual acting in his official capacity on behalf of a foreign state,' ” but not to “ 'an official who acts beyond the scope of his authority.' ” Id., at 47a (quoting Velasco v. Government of Indonesia, 370 F.3d 392, 398, 399 (CA4 2004)). The court rejected respondents' argument that petitioner was necessarily  acting beyond the scope of his authority because he allegedly violated international law.3Because we hold that the FSIA does not govern whether an individual foreign official enjoys immunity from suit, we need not reach respondents' argument that an official is not immune under the FSIA for acts of torture and extrajudicial killing. See Brief for Respondents 51-53. We note that in determining petitioner had not acted beyond the scope of his authority, the District Court afforded great weight to letters from the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG) to the State Department, App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a, in which the TFG supported petitioner's claim of immunity and stated “the actions attributed to [petitioner] in the lawsuit . . . would have been taken by [petitioner] in his official capacities,” App. 104. Although the District Court described the TFG as “recognized by the United States as the governing body in Somalia,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 54a, the United States does not recognize the TFG (or any other entity) as the Government of Somalia, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 5.

The Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the District Court's ruling that the FSIA governs petitioner's immunity from suit. It acknowledged “the majority view” among the Circuits that “the FSIA applies to individual officials of a foreign state.” 552 F.3d 371, 378 (CA4 2009).4Compare 552 F.3d, at 381 (holding the FSIA does not govern the immunity of individual foreign officials), and Enahoro v. Abubakar, 408 F.3d 877, 881-882 (CA7 2005) (same), with Chuidian v. Philippine Nat. Bank, 912 F.2d 1095, 1103 (CA9 1990) (concluding that a suit against an individual official for acts committed in his official capacity must be analyzed under the FSIA), In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008) (same), Keller v. Cent. Bank of Nig., 277 F.3d 811, 815 (CA6 2002) (same), Byrd v. Corporacion Forestal y Industrial de Olancho S. A., 182 F.3d 380, 388 (CA5 1999) (same), and El-Fadl v. Central Bank of Jordan, 75 F.3d 668, 671, 316 U.S. App. D.C. 86 (CADC 1996) (same). It disagreed with that view, however, and concluded, “based on the language and structure of the statute, that the FSIA does not apply to individual foreign government agents like [petitioner].” Id., at 381.5As an alternative basis for its decision, the Court of Appeals held that even if a current official is covered by the FSIA, a former official is not. See 552 F.3d, at 381-383. Because we agree with the Court of Appeals on its broader ground that individual officials are not covered by the FSIA, petitioner's status as a former official is irrelevant to our analysis. Having found that the FSIA does not  govern whether petitioner enjoys immunity from suit, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for further proceedings, including a determination of whether petitioner is entitled to immunity under the common law. Id., at 383-384. We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 49, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).

II 

The doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity developed as a matter of common law long before the FSIA was enacted in 1976. In Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1983), we explained that in Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 7 Cranch 116, 3 L. Ed. 287 (1812), “Chief Justice Marshall concluded that . . . the United States had impliedly waived jurisdiction over certain activities of foreign sovereigns.” The Court's specific holding in Schooner Exchange was that a federal court lacked jurisdiction over “a national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of France,” id., at 146, 7 Cranch 116, 3 L. Ed. 287, but the opinion was interpreted as extending virtually absolute immunity to foreign sovereigns as “a matter of grace and comity,” Verlinden, 461 U.S., at 486, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81.

Following Schooner Exchange, a two-step procedure developed for resolving a foreign state's claim of sovereign immunity, typically asserted on behalf of seized vessels. See, e.g., Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.S. 30, 34-36, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729 (1945); Ex parte Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 587-589, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014 (1943); Compania Espanola de Navegacion Maritima, S. A. v. The Navemar, 303 U.S. 68, 74-75, 58 S. Ct. 432, 82 L. Ed. 667 (1938). Under that procedure, the diplomatic representative of the sovereign could request a “suggestion of immunity” from the State Department. Ex parte Peru, 318 U.S., at 581, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014. If the request was granted, the district court surrendered its jurisdiction. Id., at 588, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014; see also Hoffman, 324 U.S., at 34, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729. But “in the absence of recognition of the immunity by the Department of State,” a district court “had authority to decide for itself whether all the requisites for such immunity existed.” Ex parte Peru, 318 U.S., at 587, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014; see also Compania Espanola, 303 U.S., at 75, 58 S. Ct. 432, 82 L. Ed. 667 (approving judicial inquiry into sovereign  immunity when the “Department of State . . . declined to act”); Heaney v. Government of Spain, 445 F.2d 501, 503, and n. 2 (CA2 1971) (evaluating sovereign immunity when the State Department had not responded to a request for its views). In making that decision, a district court inquired “whether the ground of immunity is one which it is the established policy of the [State Department] to recognize.” Hoffman, 324 U.S., at 36, 65 S. Ct. 530, 89 L. Ed. 729. Although cases involving individual foreign officials as defendants were rare, the same two-step procedure was typically followed when a foreign official asserted immunity. See, e.g., Heaney, 445 F.2d, at 504-505; Waltier v. Thomson, 189 F. Supp. 319 (SDNY 1960).6Diplomatic and consular officers could also claim the “specialized immunities” accorded those officials, Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 66, Comment b (1964-1965) (hereinafter Restatement), and officials qualifying as the “head of state” could claim immunity on that basis, see Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 7 Cranch 116, 137, 3 L. Ed. 287 (1812) (describing “the exemption of the person of the sovereign” from “a jurisdiction incompatible with his dignity”).

Prior to 1952, the State Department followed a general practice of requesting immunity in all actions against friendly sovereigns, but in that year the Department announced its adoption of the “restrictive” theory of sovereign immunity. Verlinden, 461 U.S., at 486-487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81; see also Letter from Jack B. Tate, Acting Legal Adviser, Dept. of State, to Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman (May 19, 1952), reprinted in 26 Dept. State Bull. 984-985 (1952). Under this theory, “immunity is confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign's public acts, and does not extend to cases arising out of a foreign state's strictly commercial acts.” Verlinden, 461 U.S., at 487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81. This change threw “immunity determinations into some disarray,” because “political considerations sometimes led the Department to file 'suggestions of immunity in cases where immunity would not have been available under the restrictive theory.' Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 690, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2004) (quoting Verlinden, 461 U.S., at 487, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81).

Congress responded to the inconsistent application of sovereign immunity by enacting the FSIA in 1976. Altmann, 541 U.S., at 690-691, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1; see also Verlinden,461 U.S., at 487-488, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81. Section 1602describes the Act's two primary purposes: (1) to endorse and codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, and (2) to transfer primary responsibility for deciding “claims of foreign states to immunity” from the State Department to the courts.7The full text of § 1602, entitled “Findings and declaration of purpose,” reads as follows:   “The Congress finds that the determination by United States courts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. Under international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.” After the enactment of the FSIA, the Act--and not the pre-existing common law--indisputably governs the determination of whether a foreign state is entitled to sovereign immunity.

What we must now decide is whether the Act also covers the immunity claims of foreign officials. We begin with the statute's text and then consider petitioner's reliance on its history and purpose.

III 

 The FSIA provides that “a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Statesand of the States” except as provided in the Act. § 1604. Thus, if a defendant is a “foreign state” within the meaning of the Act, then the defendant is immune from jurisdiction unless  one of the exceptions in the Act applies. See §§ 1605-1607 (2006 ed. and Supp. II) (enumerating exceptions). The Act, if it applies, is the “sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in federal court.” Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 439, 109 S. Ct. 683, 102 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1989). The question we face in this case is whether an individual sued for conduct undertaken in his official capacity is a “foreign state” within the meaning of the Act.

The Act defines “foreign state” in § 1603 (2006 ed.) as follows:

 “(a) A 'foreign state' . . . includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).“(b) An 'agency or instrumentality of a foreign state' means any entity--“(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and“(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and“(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any third country.”

 The term “foreign state” on its face indicates a body politic that governs a particular territory. See, e.g., Restatement § 4 (defining “state” as “an entity that has a defined territory and population under the control of a government and that engages in foreign relations”). In § 1603(a), however, the Act establishes that “foreign state” has a broader meaning, by mandating the inclusion of the state's political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. Then, in § 1603(b), the Act specifically delimits what counts as an agency or instrumentality. Petitioner argues that either “foreign state,” § 1603(a), or “agency or instrumentality,” § 1603(b),  could be read to include a foreign official. Although we agree that petitioner's interpretation is literally possible, our analysis of the entire statutory text persuades us that petitioner's reading is not the meaning that Congress enacted.

We turn first to the term “agency or instrumentality of a foreign state,” § 1603(b). It is true that an individual official could be an “agency or instrumentality,” if that term is given the meaning of “any thing or person through which action is accomplished,” In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 538 F.3d 71, 83 (CA2 2008). But Congress has specifically defined “agency or instrumentality” in the FSIA, and all of the textual clues in that definition cut against such a broad construction.

First,  the statute specifies that “ 'agency or instrumentality . . .' means any entity” matching three specified characteristics, § 1603(b) (emphasis added), and “entity” typically refers to an organization, rather than an individual. See, e.g., Black's Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed. 2009). Furthermore, several of the required characteristics apply awkwardly, if at all, to individuals. The phrase “separate legal person, corporate or otherwise,” § 1603(b)(1), could conceivably refer to a natural person, solely by virtue of the word “person.” But the phrase “separate legal person” typically refers to the legal fiction that allows an entity to hold personhood separate from the natural persons who are its shareholders or officers. Cf. First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 625, 103 S. Ct. 2591, 77 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1983) (“Separate legal personality has been described as 'an almost indispensable aspect of the public corporation' ”). It is similarly awkward to refer to a person as an “organ” of the foreign state. See § 1603(b)(2). And the third part of the definition could not be applied at all to a natural person. A natural person cannot be a citizen of a State “as defined in section 1332(c) and (e),” § 1603(b)(3), because those subsections refer to the citizenship of corporations and estates. Nor can a natural person be “created under the laws of any  third country.” Ibid.8Petitioner points out that § 1603(b)(3) describes only which defendants cannot be agencies or instrumentalities. He suggests that it therefore tells us nothing about which defendants can be covered by that term. Brief for Petitioner 46. Even if so, reading § 1603(b) as petitioner suggests would leave us with the odd result that a corporation that is the citizen of a state is excluded from the definition under § 1603(b)(3), and thus not immune, whereas a natural person who is the citizen of a state is not excluded, and thus retains his immunity. Thus,  the terms Congress chose simply do not evidence the intent to include individual officials within the meaning of “agency or instrumentality.”9 Nor does anything in the legislative history suggest that Congress intended the term “agency or instrumentality” to include individuals. On the contrary, the legislative history, like the statute, speaks in terms of entities. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 94-1487, p. 15 (1976) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.) (“The first criterion, that the entity be a separate legal person, is intended to include a corporation, association, foundation, or any other entity which, under the law of the foreign state where it was created, can sue or be sued in its own name”).  Justice Scalia may well be correct that it is not strictly necessary to confirm our reading of the statutory text by consulting the legislative history, see post, at 326-327, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1067-1068 (opinion concurring in judgment). But as the Court explained some years ago in an opinion authored by Justice White: “As for the propriety of using legislative history at all, common sense suggests that inquiry benefits from reviewing additional information rather than ignoring it. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, '[w]here the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes every thing from which aid can be derived.' United States v. Fisher, 6 U.S. 358, 2 Cranch 358, 386, [2 L. Ed. 304] (1805). Legislative history materials are not generally so misleading that jurists should never employ them in a good-faith effort to discern legislative intent. Our precedents demonstrate that the Court's practice of utilizing legislative history reaches well into its past. See, e.g., Wallace v. Parker, 31 U.S. 680, 6 Pet. 680, 687-690, [8 L. Ed. 543] (1832). We suspect that the practice will likewise reach well into the future.” Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597, 611-612, n. 4, 111 S. Ct. 2476, 115 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1991) (alteration in original). Cf. Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 474, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2003) (describing § 1603(b) as containing “indicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind”).

Petitioner proposes a second textual route to including an official within the meaning of “foreign state.” He argues  that the definition of “foreign state” in § 1603(a) sets out a nonexhaustive list that “includes” political subdivisions and agencies or instrumentalities but is not so limited. See Brief for Petitioner 22-23.  It is true that use of the word “include” can signal that the list that follows is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.10See 2A N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 47.7, p. 305 (7th ed. 2007) (“[T]he word 'includes' is usually a term of enlargement, and not of limitation” (some internal quotation marks omitted)). And, to be sure, there are fewer textual clues within § 1603(a) than within § 1603(b) from which to interpret Congress' silence regarding foreign officials. But even if the list in § 1603(a) is merely illustrative, it still suggests that “foreign state” does not encompass officials, because the types of defendants listed are all entities. See Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778, 58 Ct. Cl. 708 (1923) ( “[A] word may be known by the company it keeps”).

Moreover, elsewhere in the FSIA Congress expressly mentioned officials when it wished to count their acts as equivalent to those of the foreign state, which suggests that officials are not included within the unadorned term “foreign state.” Cf. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. 85, 103, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007) ( “Drawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate . . . [when] Congress has shown that it knows how to [address an issue] in express terms”). For example, Congress provided an exception from the general grant of immunity for cases in which “money damages are sought against a foreign state” for an injury in the United States “caused by the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office.” § 1605(a)(5) (2006 ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added). The same reference to officials is made in a similar, later enacted exception. See § 1605A(a)(1) (eliminating immunity for suits “in which money damages are sought against a foreign state” for certain acts “engaged in  by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency”); see also § 1605A(c) (creating a cause of action against the “foreign state” and “any official, employee, or agent” thereof).11Petitioner argues that § 1605A abrogates immunity for certain acts by individual officials, which would be superfluous if the officials were not otherwise immune. See Brief for Petitioner 41-43. But the import of § 1605A is precisely the opposite.  First, § 1605A(a)(1) eliminates the immunity of the state for certain acts of its officers; it says a “foreign state shall not be immune” in a suit “in which money damages are sought against a foreign state.” As it does not expressly refer to the immunity of individual officers, it adds nothing to petitioner's argument. Second, the creation of a cause of action against both the “foreign state” and “any official, employee, or agent” thereof, § 1605A(c), reinforces the idea that “foreign state” does not by definition include foreign officials. If the term “foreign state” by definition includes an individual acting within the scope of his office, the phrase “or of any official or employee . . .” in § 1605(a)(5) would be unnecessary. See Dole Food Co., 538 U.S., at 476-477, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 ( “[W]e should not construe the statute in a manner that is strained and, at the same time, would render a statutory term superfluous”).

Other provisions of the statute also point away from reading “foreign state” to include foreign officials. Congress made no express mention of service of process on individuals in § 1608(a) (2006 ed.), which governs service upon a foreign state or political subdivision. Although some of the methods listed could be used to serve individuals--for example, by delivery “in accordance with an applicable international convention,” § 1608(a)(2) --the methods specified are at best very roundabout ways of serving an individual official. Furthermore, Congress made specific remedial choices for different types of defendants. See § 1606 (allowing punitive damages for an agency or instrumentality but not for a foreign state); § 1610 (affording a plaintiff greater rights to attach the property of an agency or instrumentality as compared to the property of a foreign state). By adopting petitioner's  reading of “foreign state,” we would subject claims against officials to the more limited remedies available in suits against states, without so much as a whisper from Congress on the subject. (And if we were instead to adopt petitioner's other textual argument, we would subject those claims to the different, more expansive, remedial scheme for agencies) The Act's careful calibration of remedies among the listed types of defendants suggests that Congress did not mean to cover other types of defendants never mentioned in the text.

In sum,  “[w]e do not . . . construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.” United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822, 828, 104 S. Ct. 2769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 680 (1984).  Reading the FSIA as a whole, there is nothing to suggest we should read “foreign state” in § 1603(a) to include an official acting on behalf of the foreign state, and much to indicate that this meaning was not what Congress enacted.12Nor is it the case that the FSIA's “legislative history does not even hint of an intent to exclude individual officials,” Chuidian, 912 F.2d, at 1101. The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend the FSIA to address position-based individual immunities such as diplomatic and consular immunity. H. R. Rep., at 12 (“The bill is not intended . . . . to affect either diplomatic or consular immunity”). It also suggests that general “official immunity” is something separate from the subject of the bill. See id., at 23 (“The bill does not attempt to deal with questions of discovery . . . [I]f a plaintiff sought to depose a diplomat in the United States or a high-ranking official of a foreign government, diplomatic and official immunity would apply”). The text does not expressly foreclose petitioner's reading, but it supports the view of respondents and the United States that the Act does not address an official's claim to immunity.

IV 

Petitioner argues that the FSIA is best read to cover his claim to immunity because of its history and purpose. As discussed at the outset,  one of the primary purposes of the FSIA was to codify the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity,  which Congress recognized as consistent with extant international law. See § 1602. We have observed that a related purpose was “codification of international law at the time of the FSIA's enactment,” Permanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of New York, 551 U.S. 193, 199, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85 (2007), and have examined the relevant common law and international practice when interpreting the Act, id., at 200-201, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85. Because of this relationship between the Act and the common law that it codified, petitioner argues that we should construe the FSIA consistently with the common law regarding individual immunity, which--in petitioner's view--was coextensive with the law of state immunity and always immunized a foreign official for acts taken on behalf of the foreign state. Even reading the Act in light of Congress' purpose of codifying state sovereign immunity, however, we do not think that the Act codified the common law with respect to the immunity of individual officials.

 The canon of construction that statutes should be interpreted consistently with the common law helps us interpret a statute that clearly covers a field formerly governed by the common law.13Congress “is understood to legislate against a background of common-law . . . principles,” Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108, 111 S. Ct. 2166, 115 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1991), and when a statute covers an issue previously governed by the common law, we interpret the statute with the presumption that Congress intended to retain the substance of the common law. see Isbrandtsen Co. v. Johnson, 343 U.S. 779, 783, 72 S. Ct. 1011, 96 L. Ed. 1294 (1952) (“Statutes which invade the common law . . . are to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar principles, except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident”). But the canon does not help us to decide the antecedent question whether, when a statute's coverage is ambiguous, Congress intended the statute to govern a particular field--in this case, whether Congress intended the FSIA to supersede the common law of official immunity.14We find similarly inapposite petitioner's invocation of the canon that a statute should be interpreted in compliance with international law, see Murray v. Schooner Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. 64, 2 Cranch 64, 118, 2 L. Ed. 208 (1804), and his argument that foreign relations and the reciprocal protection of United States officials abroad would be undermined if we do not adopt his reading of the Act. Because we are not deciding that the FSIA bars petitioner's immunity but rather that the Act does not address the question, we need not determine whether declining to afford immunity to petitioner would be consistent with international law.

Petitioner argues that because state and official immunities are coextensive, Congress must have codified official immunity when it codified state immunity. See Brief for Petitioner 26-30. But the relationship between a state's immunity and an official's immunity is more complicated than petitioner suggests, although we need not and do not resolve the dispute among the parties as to the precise scope of an official's immunity at common law. The very authority to which petitioner points us, and which we have previously found instructive, see, e.g. Permanent Mission, 551 U.S., at 200, 127 S. Ct. 2352, 168 L. Ed. 2d 85, states that the immunity of individual officials is subject to a caveat not applicable to any of the other entities or person15The Restatement does not apply this caveat to the head of state, head of government, or foreign minister. See Restatement § 66. Whether petitioner may be entitled to head of state immunity, or any other immunity, under the common law is a question we leave open for remand. See 552 F.3d 371, 383 (CA4 2009). We express no view on whether Restatement § 66 correctly sets out the scope of the common-law immunity applicable to current or former foreign officials. to which the foreign state's immunity extends. The Restatement provides that the “immunity of a foreign state . . . extends to . . . any other public minister, official, or agent of the state with respect to acts performed in his official capacity if the effect of exercising jurisdiction would be to enforce a rule of law against the state.” Restatement § 66 (emphasis added).16Respondents contend that this caveat refers to “the compulsive effect of the judgment on the state,” Brief for Respondents 42, but petitioner disputes that meaning, Reply Brief for Petitioner 17-18. We need not resolve their dispute, as it is enough for present purposes that the Restatement indicates a foreign official's immunity may turn upon a requirement not applicable to any other type of defendant. And historically, the Government sometimes  suggested immunity under the common law for individual officials even when the foreign state did not qualify. See, e.g., Greenspan v. Crosbie, No. 74 Civ. 4734 (GLG), 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12155, 1976 WL 841 (SDNY, Nov. 23, 1976). There is therefore little reason to presume that when Congress set out to codify state immunity, it must also have, sub silentio, intended to codify official immunity.

Petitioner urges that a suit against an official must always be equivalent to a suit against the state because acts taken by a state official on behalf of a state are acts of the state. See Brief for Petitioner 26. We have recognized, in the context of the act of state doctrine, that an official's acts can be considered the acts of the foreign state, and that “the courts of one country will not sit in judgment” of those acts when done within the territory of the foreign state. See Underhill v. Hernandez, 168 U.S. 250, 252, 254, 18 S. Ct. 83, 42 L. Ed. 456 (1897). Although the act of state doctrine is distinct from immunity, and instead “provides foreign states with a substantive defense on the merits,” Altmann, 541 U.S., at 700, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1, we do not doubt that in some circumstances the immunity of the foreign state extends to an individual for acts taken in his official capacity. But it does not follow from this premise that Congress intended to codify that immunity in the FSIA. It hardly furthers Congress' purpose of “clarifying the rules that judges should apply in resolving sovereign immunity claims,” id., at 699, 124 S. Ct. 2240, 159 L. Ed. 2d 1, to lump individual officials in with foreign states without so much as a word spelling out how and when individual officials are covered.17The Courts of Appeals have had to develop, in the complete absence of any statutory text, rules governing when an official is entitled to immunity under the FSIA. For example, Courts of Appeals have applied the rule that foreign sovereign immunity extends to an individual official “for acts committed in his official capacity” but not to “an official who acts beyond the scope of his authority.” Chuidian, 912 F.2d, at 1103, 1106. That may be correct as a matter of common-law principles, but it does not derive from any clarification or codification by Congress. Furthermore, if Congress intended the FSIA to reach individuals, one would expect the Act to have addressed whether former officials are covered, an issue it settled with respect to instrumentalities, see Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 478, 123 S. Ct. 1655, 155 L. Ed. 2d 643 (2003)(“[I]nstrumentality status [must] be determined at the time suit is filed”).

 Petitioner would have a stronger case if there were any indication that Congress' intent to enact a comprehensive solution for suits against states extended to suits against individual officials. But to the extent Congress contemplated the Act's effect upon officials at all, the evidence points in the opposite direction. As we have already mentioned, the legislative history points toward an intent to leave official immunity outside the scope of the Act. See n. 12, supra. And although questions of official immunity did arise in the pre-FSIA period, they were few and far between.18A study that attempted to gather all of the State Department decisions related to sovereign immunity from the adoption of the restrictive theory in 1952 to the enactment of the FSIA reveals only four decisions related to official immunity, and two related to head of state immunity, out of a total of 110 decisions. Sovereign Immunity Decisions of the Dept. of State, May 1952 to Jan. 1977 (M. Sandler, D. Vagts, & B. Ristau eds.), in Digest of U. S. Practice in International Law 1977, pp. 1020, 1080 (hereinafter Digest). The immunity of officials simply was not the particular problem to which Congress was responding when it enacted the FSIA. The FSIA was adopted, rather, to address “a modern world where foreign state enterprises are every day participants in commercial activities,” and to assure litigants that decisions regarding claims against states and their enterprises “are made on purely legal grounds.” H. R. Rep., at 7. We have been given no reason to believe that Congress saw as a problem, or wanted to eliminate, the State Department's role in determinations regarding individual official immunity.19The FSIA was introduced in accordance with the recommendation of the State Department. H. R. Rep., at 6. The Department sought and supported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against foreign states and their agencies or instrumentalities. See Hearings on H. R. 11315 before the Subcommittee on Administrative Law and Governmental Relations of the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1976) (testimony of Monroe Leigh, Legal Adviser, Dept. of State) (“[I]t is our judgment . . . that the advantages of having a judicial determination greatly outweigh the advantage of being able to intervene in a lawsuit”). But the Department has from the time of the FSIA's enactment understood the Act to leave intact the Department's role in official immunity cases. See Digest 1020 (“These decisions [of the Department regarding the immunity of officials] may be of some future significance, because the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not deal with the immunity of individual officials, but only that of foreign states and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities”).

Finally, our reading of the FSIA will not “in effect make the statute optional,” as some Courts of Appeals have feared, by allowing litigants through “artful pleading . . . to take advantage of the Act's provisions or, alternatively, choose to proceed under the old common law,” Chuidian v. Philippine Nat. Bank,912 F.2d 1095, 1102 (CA9 1990).  Even if a suit is not governed by the Act, it may still be barred by foreign sovereign immunity under the common law. And not every suit can successfully be pleaded against an individual official alone.20Furthermore, a plaintiff seeking to sue a foreign official will not be able to rely on the Act's service of process and jurisdictional provisions. Thus, a plaintiff will have to establish that the district court has personal jurisdiction over an official without the benefit of the FSIA provision that makes personal jurisdiction over a foreign state automatic when an exception to immunity applies and service of process has been accomplished in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1608. See § 1330(b) (“Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a),” i.e., claims for which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity, “where service has been made under section 1608 of this title”).  Even when a plaintiff names only a foreign official, it may be the case that the foreign state itself, its political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality is a required party, because that party has “an interest relating to the subject of the action” and “disposing of the action in the person's absence may . . . as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest.” Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19(a)(1)(B). If this is the case, and the entity is immune  from suit under the FSIA, the district court may have to dismiss the suit, regardless of whether the official is immune or not under the common law. See Republic of Philippines v. Pimentel, 553 U.S. 851, 867, 128 S. Ct. 2180, 171 L. Ed. 2d 131 (2008) ( “[W]here sovereign immunity is asserted, and the claims of the sovereign are not frivolous, dismissal of the action must be ordered where there is a potential for injury to the interests of the absent sovereign”). Or  it may be the case that some actions against an official in his official capacity should be treated as actions against the foreign state itself, as the state is the real party in interest. Cf. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985) (“[A]n official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity. It is not a suit against the official personally, for the real party in interest is the entity” (citation omitted)).

We are thus not persuaded that our construction of the statute's text should be affected by the risk that plaintiffs may use artful pleading to attempt to select between application of the FSIA or the common law. And we think  this case, in which respondents have sued petitioner in his personal capacity and seek damages from his own pockets, is properly governed by the common law because it is not a claim against a foreign state as the Act defines that term. Although Congress clearly intended to supersede the common-law regime for claims against foreign states, we find nothing in the statute's origin or aims to indicate that Congress similarly wanted to codify the law of foreign official immunity.

V 

Our review of the text, purpose, and history of the FSIA leads us to the conclusion that the Court of Appeals correctly held the FSIA does not govern petitioner's claim of immunity. The Act therefore did not deprive the District Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. We emphasize, however, the narrowness of our holding. Whether petitioner may be entitled to immunity under the common law, and whether he may  have other valid defenses to the grave charges against him, are matters to be addressed in the first instance by the District Court on remand. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether a federal district court may entertain a complaint of allegedly discriminatory state taxation, framed as a request to increase a commercial competitor's tax burden. Relevant to our inquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U.S.C. § 1341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining “the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.” More embracive than the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable in state taxation cases restrains federal courts from entertaining claims for relief that risk disrupting state tax administration. See Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary, 454 U.S. 100, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1981). The comity doctrine, we hold, requires that a claim of the kind here presented proceed originally in state court. In so ruling, we distinguish Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (2004), in which the Court held that neither the TIA nor the comity doctrine barred a federal district court from adjudicating an Establishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit that allegedly funneled public funds to parochial schools.

Historically, all natural gas consumers in Ohio purchased gas from the public utility, known as a local distribution company (LDC), serving their geographic area. In addition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and operate networks of distribution pipelines to transport and deliver gas to consumers. LDCs offer customers a single, bundled product comprising both gas and delivery.

Today, consumers in Ohio's major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with an independent marketer (IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural gas. IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines; they use LDCs' pipelines. When a customer goes with an IM, therefore, she purchases two “unbundled” products: gas (from the IM) and delivery (from the LDC).

Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax purposes. Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions that IMs do not receive. First, LDCs' natural gas sales are exempt from sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 5739.02(B)(7)(Lexis Supp. 2010); §§ 5739.021(E), .023(G), .026(F) (Lexis 2008); §§ 5741.02(C), .021(A), .022(A), .023(A) (Lexis 2008). LDCs owe instead a gross receipts excise tax, § 5727.24, which is lower than the sales and use taxes IMs must collect. Second, LDCs are not subject to the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs' taxable gross receipts. §§ 5751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010). Finally, Ohio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales from the gross receipts tax, which IMs must pay when they purchase gas from LDCs. § 5727.33(B)(4) (Lexis 2008).

Plaintiffs-respondents Commerce Energy, Inc., a California corporation, and Interstate Gas Supply, Inc., an Ohio company, are IMs that market and sell natural gas to Ohio consumers. Plaintiff-respondent Gregory Slone is an Ohio citizen who has purchased natural gas from Interstate Gas Supply since 1999. Alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses, Complaint PP35-39, App. 11-13, respondents sued Richard A. Levin, Tax Commissioner of Ohio (Commissioner), in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Invoking that court's federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, Complaint P6, App. 3, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief invalidating the three tax exemptions LDCs enjoy and ordering the Commissioner to stop “recognizing and/or enforcing” the exemptions. Id., at 20-21. Respondents named the Commissioner as sole defendant; they did not extend the litigation to include the LDCs whose tax burden their suit aimed to increase.1 In moving to dismiss the complaint, the Commissioner urged, inter alia, that the LDCs were parties necessary to a just adjudication. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 19. Ruling for the Commissioner on comity grounds, the District Court did not reach the question whether the LDCs were indispensable parties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a, 32a-33a.

The District Court granted the Commissioner's motion to dismiss the complaint. The TIA did not block the suit, the District Court initially held, because respondents, like the plaintiffs in Hibbs, were “third-parties challenging the constitutionality of [another's] tax benefit,” and their requested relief “would not disrupt the flow of tax revenue” to the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a.

Nevertheless, the District Court “decline[d] to exercise jurisdiction” as a matter of comity. Id., at 32a. Ohio's Legislature, the District Court observed, chose to provide the challenged tax exemptions to LDCs. Respondents requested relief that would “requir[e] Ohio to collect taxes which its legislature has not seen fit to impose.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Such relief, the court said, would draw federal judges into “a particularly inappropriate involvement in a state's management of its fiscal operations.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A state court, the District Court recognized, could extend the exemptions to IMs, but the TIA proscribed this revenue-reducing relief in federal court. “Where there would be two possible remedies,” the Court concluded, a federal court should not “impose its own judgment on the state legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.” Ibid.

The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. 554 F.3d 1094 (2009). While agreeing that the TIA did not bar respondents' suit, the Sixth Circuit rejected the District Court's comity ruling. A footnote in Hibbs, the Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the District Court's “expansive reading” of this Court's comity precedents. 554 F.3d, at 1098. The footnote stated that the Court “has relied upon 'principles of comity' to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs, 542 U.S., at 107, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172 (citation omitted). A broad view of the comity cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would render the TIA “effectively superfluous,” and would “sub silentio overrule a series of important cases” presenting challenges to state tax measures. 554 F.3d, at 1099, 1102 (citing Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 97 S. Ct. 2749, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1977); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 103 S. Ct. 3062, 77 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1983)); 554 F.3d, at 1099-1100.

In so ruling, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the Seventh and Ninth Circuits, which had similarly read Hibbs to rein in the comity doctrine, see Levy v. Pappas, 510 F.3d 755 (CA7 2007); Wilbur v. Locke, 423 F.3d 1101 (CA9 2005), and it disagreed with the Fourth Circuit, which had concluded that Hibbs left comity doctrine untouched, see DIRECTV, Inc. v. Tolson, 513 F.3d 119 (2008). Noting that respondents “challenge[d] only a few limited exemptions,” and satisfied, therefore, that “[respondents'] success would not significantly intrude upon traditional matters of state taxation,” the Sixth Circuit remanded the case for adjudication of the merits. 554 F.3d, at 1102.

After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing en banc, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a-2a, the Commissioner petitioned for certiorari. By then, the First Circuit had joined the Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that Hibbs sharply limited the scope of the comity bar. Coors Brewing Co. v. Mendez-Torres, 562 F.3d 3 (2009). We granted the Commissioner's petition, 558 U.S. 989, 130 S. Ct. 496, 175 L. Ed. 2d 344 (2009), to resolve the disagreement among the Circuits.

A 

Comity considerations, the Commissioner dominantly urges, preclude the exercise of lower federal-court adjudicatory authority over this controversy, given that an adequate state-court forum is available to hear and decide respondents' constitutional claims. We agree.

 The comity doctrine counsels lower federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling within their jurisdiction. The doctrine reflects

“a proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in separate ways.” Fair Assessment, 454 U.S., at 112, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (quoting Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 44, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1971)).

Comity's constraint has particular force when lower federal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of commercial activity. For “[i]t is upon taxation that the several States chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry on their respective governments, and it is of the utmost importance to all of them that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied should be interfered with as little as possible.” Dows v. Chicago, 78 U.S. 108, 11 Wall. 108, 110, 20 L. Ed. 65 (1871).

“An examination of [our] decisions,” this Court wrote more than a century ago, “shows that a proper reluctance to interfere by prevention with the fiscal operations of the state governments has caused [us] to refrain from so doing in all cases where the Federal rights of the persons could otherwise be preserved unimpaired.” Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, 213 U.S. 276, 282, 29 S. Ct. 426, 53 L. Ed. 796 (1909). Accord Matthews v. Rodgers, 284 U.S. 521, 525-526, 52 S. Ct. 217, 76 L. Ed. 447 (1932) (So long as the state remedy was “plain, adequate, and complete,” the “scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of state governments which should at all times actuate the federal courts, and a proper reluctance to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations, require that such relief should be denied in every case where the asserted federal right may be preserved without it.”).2Justice Brennan cogently explained, in practical terms, “the special reasons justifying the policy of federal noninterference with state tax collection”:  “The procedures for mass assessment and collection of state taxes and for administration and adjudication of taxpayers' disputes with tax officials are generally complex and necessarily designed to operate according to established rules. State tax agencies are organized to discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the state procedures. If federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments, state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law. During the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State's budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer insolvency. Moreover, federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.” Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 128, n. 17, 91 S. Ct. 674, 27 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1971) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).

 Statutes conferring federal jurisdiction, we have repeatedly cautioned, should be read with sensitivity to “federal-state relations” and “wise judicial administration.” Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 716, 116 S. Ct. 1712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). But by 1937, in state tax cases, the federal courts had moved in a different direction: they “had be come free and easy with injunctions.” Fair Assessment, 454 U.S., at 129, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).3Two features of federal equity practice accounted for the courts' willingness to grant injunctive relief. First, the Court had held that, although “equity jurisdiction does not lie where there exists an adequate legal remedy[,] . . . the 'adequate legal remedy' must be one cognizable in federal court.” Fair Assessment, 454 U.S., at 129, n. 15, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (emphasis in original). Second, federal courts, “construing strictly the requirement that the remedy available at law be 'plain, adequate and complete,' had frequently concluded that the procedures provided by the State were not adequate.” Ibid. (citation omitted).Congress passed the TIA to reverse this trend. Id., at 109-110, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271 (opinion of the Court).

Our post-Act decisions, however, confirm the continuing sway of comity considerations, independent of the Act. Plaintiffs in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (1943), for example, sought a federal judgment declaring Louisiana's unemployment compensation tax unconstitutional. Writing six years after the TIA's passage, we emphasized the Act's animating concerns:  A “federal court of equity,” we reminded, “may in an appropriate case refuse to give its special protection to private rights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be prejudicial to the public interest, [and] should stay its hand in the public interest when it reasonably appears that private interests will not suffer.” Id., at 297-298, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (citations omitted). In enacting the TIA, we noted, “Congress recognized and gave sanction to this practice.” Id., at 298, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407. We could not have thought Congress intended to cabin the comity doctrine, for we went on to instruct dismissal in Great Lakes on comity grounds without deciding whether the Act reached declaratory judgment actions. Id., at 299, 301-302, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407.4We later held that the Act indeed does proscribe suits for declaratory relief that would thwart state tax collection. California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 411, 102 S. Ct. 2498, 73 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1982).

Decades later, in Fair Assessment, we ruled, based on comity concerns, that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not permit federal courts to award damages in state taxation cases when state law provides an adequate remedy. 454 U.S., at 116, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271. We clarified in Fair Assessment that  “the principle of comity which predated the Act was not restricted by its passage.” Id., at 110, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271. And in National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 515 U.S. 582, 590, 115 S. Ct. 2351, 132 L. Ed. 2d 509 (1995), we said, explicitly, that “the [TIA] may be best understood as but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation.”

B 

Although our precedents affirm that the comity doctrine is more embracive than the TIA, several Courts of Appeals, including the Sixth Circuit in the instant case, have comprehended HibbsHibbs to restrict comity's compass. See supra, at 420-421, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140. Hibbs, however, has a more modest reach.

Plaintiffs in Hibbs were Arizona taxpayers who challenged a state law authorizing tax credits for payments to organizations that disbursed scholarship grants to children attending private schools. 542 U.S., at 94-96, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. These organizations could fund attendance at institutions that provided religious instruction or gave admissions preference on the basis of religious affiliation. Id., at 95, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. Ranking the credit program as state subsidization of religion, incompatible with the Establishment Clause, plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief and an order requiring the organizations to pay sums still in their possession into the State's general fund. Id., at 96, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172.

The Director of Arizona's Department of Revenue sought to escape suit in federal court by invoking the TIA. We held that the litigation fell outside the TIA's governance. Our prior decisions holding suits blocked by the TIA, we noted, were tied to the Act's “state-revenue-protective moorings.” Id., at 106, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. The Act, we explained, “restrain[ed] state taxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their [own] liability for state taxes,” id., at 108, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172, suits that, if successful, would deplete state coffers. But “third parties” like the Hibbs plaintiffs, we concluded, were not impeded by the TIA “from pursuing constitutional challenges to tax benefits in a federal forum.” Ibid. The case, we stressed, was “not rationally distinguishable” from a procession of pathmarking civil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained challenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a jurisdictional barrier. Id., at 93-94, 110-112, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. See, e.g., Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty., 377 U.S. 218, 84 S. Ct. 1226, 12 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1964) (involving, inter alia, tax credits for contributions to private segregated schools).

Arizona's Revenue Director also invoked comity as cause for dismissing the action. We dispatched the Director's comity argument in a spare footnote that moved the Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Court's comity-based dismissal. As earlier set out, see supra, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140, the footnote stated:  “[T]his Court has relied upon 'principles of comity' to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state tax collection.” 542 U.S., at 107, n. 9, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172(citation omitted) (citing Fair Assessment, 454 U.S., at 107-108, 102 S. Ct. 177, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271; Great Lakes, 319 U.S., at 296-299, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407).

Relying heavily on our footnote in Hibbs, respondents urge that “comity should no more bar this action than it did the action in Hibbs.” Brief for Respondents 42. As we explain below, however, the two cases differ markedly in ways bearing on the comity calculus. We have had no prior occasion to consider, under the comity doctrine, a taxpayer's complaint about allegedly discriminatory state taxation framed as a request to increase a competitor's tax burden. Now squarely presented with the question, we hold that comity precludes the exercise of original federal-court jurisdiction in cases of the kind presented here.

A 

Respondents complain that they are taxed unevenly in comparison to LDCs and their customers. Under either an equal protection or dormant Commerce Clause theory, respondents' root objection is the same: State action, respondents contend, “selects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting [them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U.S. 620, 623, 66 S. Ct. 445, 90 L. Ed. 358 (1946) (equal protection); see Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U.S. 439, 447-448, 111 S. Ct. 865, 112 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1991)(dormant Commerce Clause).

 When economic legislation does not employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights,5Cf., e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1967); United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735 (1996). On the federal courts' role in safeguarding human rights, see, e.g., Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U.S. 241, 245-248, 88 S. Ct. 391, 19 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1967); McNeese v. Board of Ed. for Community Unit School Dist. 187, 373 U.S. 668, 672-674, 83 S. Ct. 1433, 10 L. Ed. 2d 622, and n. 6 (1963). courts generally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative choices demands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U.S. 314, 331-332, 101 S. Ct. 2376, 69 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1981); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 488-489, 75 S. Ct. 461, 99 L. Ed. 563 (1955). And “in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.” Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U.S. 83, 88, 60 S. Ct. 406, 84 L. Ed. 590 (1940).

Of key importance,  when unlawful discrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative prescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for equal treatment. How equality is accomplished--by extension or invalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure--is a matter on which the Constitution is silent. See Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 740, 104 S. Ct. 1387, 79 L. Ed. 2d 646 (1984) (“[W]hen the right invoked is that to equal treatment, the appropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment, a result that can be accomplished” in more than one way. (quotingIowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U.S. 239, 247, 52 S. Ct. 133, 76 L. Ed. 265 (1931); internal quotation marks omitted)).

 On finding unlawful discrimination, we have affirmed, courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity. Mathews, 465 U.S., at 739, n. 5, 104 S. Ct. 1387, 79 L. Ed. 2d 646; Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. 76, 92-93, 99 S. Ct. 2655, 61 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1979); seeStanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 17-18, 95 S. Ct. 1373, 43 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1975) (how State eliminates unconstitutional discrimination “plainly is an issue of state law”); cf. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005) (“legislative intent” determines cure for constitutional violation). The relief the complaining party requests does not circumscribe this inquiry. See Westcott, 443 U.S., at 96, n. 2, 99 S. Ct. 2655, 61 L. Ed. 2d 382 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“This issue should turn on the intent of [the legislature], not the interests of the parties.”). With the State's legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a State's allocation of benefits or burdens, generally remands the case, leaving the remedial choice in the hands of state authorities. See, e.g., Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.S. 142, 152-153, 100 S. Ct. 1540, 64 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1980); Orr v. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 283-284, 99 S. Ct. 1102, 59 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1979); Stanton, 421 U.S., at 17-18, 95 S. Ct. 1373, 43 L. Ed. 2d 688; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 543, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655 (1942). But see, e.g.,Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 68, 88 S. Ct. 1509, 20 L. Ed. 2d 436 (1968).

In particular,  when this Court--on review of a state high court's decision--finds a tax measure constitutionally infirm, “it has been our practice,” for reasons of “federal-state comity,” “to abstain from deciding the remedial effects of such a holding.” American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U.S. 167, 176,110 S. Ct. 2323, 110 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1990) (plurality opinion).6See, e.g., Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 100-102, 113 S. Ct. 2510, 125 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993);McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U.S. 18, 51-52, 110 S. Ct. 2238, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1990);Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 818, 109 S. Ct. 1500, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1989); American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Scheiner, 483 U.S. 266, 297-298, 107 S. Ct. 2829, 97 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1987); Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U.S. 232, 252-253, 107 S. Ct. 2810, 97 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1987); Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 276-277, 104 S. Ct. 3049, 82 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1984); Exxon Corp. v. Eagerton, 462 U.S. 176, 196-197, 103 S. Ct. 2296, 76 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1983); Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee, 288 U.S. 517, 540-541, 53 S. Ct. 481, 77 L. Ed. 929 (1933). A “State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.” McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U.S. 18, 39-40, 110 S. Ct. 2238, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1990). Our remand leaves the interim solution in state-court hands, subject to subsequent definitive disposition by the State's legislature.

If lower federal courts were to give audience to the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the interim remedial determination would be unavailable. That is so because  federal tribunals lack authority to remand to the state court system an action initiated in federal court. Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA; absent certain exceptions, see, e.g., Department of Employment v. United States, 385 U.S. 355, 357-358, 87 S. Ct. 464, 17 L. Ed. 2d 414 (1966), the Act precludes relief that would diminish state revenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the state legislature's design.7State courts also have greater leeway to avoid constitutional holdings by adopting “narrowing constructions that might obviate the constitutional problem and intelligently mediate federal constitutional concerns and state interests.” Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415, 429-430, 99 S. Ct. 2371, 60 L. Ed. 2d 994 (1979). These limitations on the remedial competence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to adjudicate them.8Any substantial federal question, of course, “could be reviewed when the case [comes to this Court] through the hierarchy of state courts.” McNeese, 373 U.S., at 673, 83 S. Ct. 1433, 10 L. Ed. 2d 622.

 B 

Comity considerations, as the District Court determined, warrant dismissal of respondents' suit. Assuming, arguendo, that respondents could pre vail on the merits of the suit,9But see General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 279-280, 117 S. Ct. 811, 136 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1997) (determining, at a time IMs could not compete with LDCs for the Ohio residential “captive” market, that IMs and LDCs were not “similarly situated”; and rejecting industrial IM customer's dormant Commerce Clause and equal protection challenges to LDCs' exemption from sales and use taxes). the most obvious way to achieve parity would be to reduce respondents' tax liability. Respondents did not seek such relief, for  the TIA stands in the way of any decree that would “enjoin . . . collection of [a] tax under State law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1341.10 Previous language restricting the district courts' “jurisdiction” was removed in the 1948 revision of Title 28. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 41(1) (1940 ed.)with § 1341, 62 Stat. 932. This Court and others have continued to regard the Act as jurisdictional. See, e.g., post, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1148 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). A more ambitious solution would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio's tax code. Were a federal court to essay such relief, however, the court would engage in the very interference in state taxation the comity doctrine aims to avoid. Cf. State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U.S. 575, 614-615, 23 L. Ed. 663 (1876). Respondents' requested remedy, an order invalidating the exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20-21, may be far from what the Ohio Legislature would have willed. See supra, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144. In short, if the Ohio scheme is indeed unconstitutional, surely the Ohio courts are better positioned to determine--unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in--how to comply with the mandate of equal treatment. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 817-818, 109 S. Ct. 1500, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1989).11Respondents note that “[o]nce the district court grants the minimal relief requested--to disallow the exemptions--it will be up to the Ohio General Assembly to balance its own interests and determine how best to recast the tax laws, within constitutional restraints.” Brief for Respondents 41. But the legislature may not be convened on the spot, and the blunt interim relief respondents ask the District Court to decree “may [immediately] derange the operations of government, and thereby cause serious detriment to the public.” Dows v. Chicago, 78 U.S. 108, 11 Wall. 108, 110, 20 L. Ed. 65 (1871).

As earlier noted, our unelaborated footnote on comity in Hibbs, see supra, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1143, led the Sixth Circuit to conclude that we had diminished the force of that doctrine and made it inapplicable here. We intended no such consequential ruling. Hibbs was hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case. It was essentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional purposes. In Hibbs, the charge was state aid in alleged violation of the Establishment Clause; in other cases of the same genre, the attack was on state allocations to maintain racially segregated schools. See Hibbs, 542 U.S., at 93-94, 110-112, 124 S. Ct. 2276, 159 L. Ed. 2d 172. The plaintiffs in Hibbs were outsiders to the tax expenditure, “third parties” whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor. In this case, by contrast, the very premise of respondents' suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs. Unlike the Hibbsplaintiffs, respondents do object to their own tax situation, measured by the allegedly more favorable treatment accorded LDCs.

Hibbs held that the TIA did not preclude a federal challenge by a third party who objected to a tax credit received by others, but in no way objected to her own liability under any revenue-raising tax provision. In context, we clarify, theHibbs foot note comment on comity is most sensibly read to affirm that, just as the case was a poor fit under the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity. The Court, in other words, did not deploy the footnote to recast the comity doctrine; it intended the note to convey only that the Establishment Clause-grounded case cleared both the TIA and comity hurdles.

Respondents steadfastly maintain that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication because of the simplicity of the relief they seek, i.e., invalidation of exemptions accorded the LDCs. But as we just explained, even if respondents' Commerce Clause and equal protection claims had merit, respondents would have no entitlement to their preferred remedy. See supra, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1144. In Hibbs, however, if the District Court found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the Establishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs' grievance: invalidation of the credit, which inevitably would increase the State's tax receipts. Notably, redress in state court similarly would be limited to an order ending the allegedly impermissible state support for parochial schools.12No refund suit (or other taxpayer mechanism) was open to the plaintiffs in Hibbs, who were financially disinterested “third parties”; they did not, therefore, improperly bypass any state procedure. Respondents here, however, could have asserted their federal rights by seeking a reduction in their tax bill in an Ohio refund suit. Because state courts would have no greater leeway than federal courts to cure the alleged violation, nothing would be lost in the currency of comity or state autonomy by permitting the Hibbs suit to proceed in a federal forum.

 Comity, in sum, serves to ensure that “the National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States.” Younger, 401 U.S., at 44, 91 S. Ct. 746, 27 L. Ed. 2d 669 . A confluence of factors in this case, absent in Hibbs, leads us to conclude that the comity doctrine controls here. First, respondents seek federal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys wide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any fundamental right or classification that attracts heightened judicial scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves as third-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax scheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor to improve their competitive position. Third, the Ohio courts are better positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any violation because they are more familiar with state legislative preferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial options. Individually, these considerations may not compel forbearance on the part of federal district courts; in combination, however, they demand deference to the state adjudicative process.

C 

The Sixth Circuit expressed concern that application of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA “effectively superfluous.” 554 F.3d, at 1099; see id., at 1102. This concern overlooks Congress' point in enacting the TIA.  The Act was passed to plug two large loopholes courts had opened in applying the comity doctrine. See supra, at ___, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 1141, and n. 3. By closing these loopholes, Congress secured the doctrine against diminishment. Comity, we further note, is a prudential doctrine. “If the State voluntarily chooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not demand that the federal court force the case back into the State's own system.” Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 480, 97 S. Ct. 1898, 52 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1977).

IV 

Because we conclude that the comity doctrine justifies dismissal of respondents' federal-court action, we need not decide whether the TIA would itself block the suit. See Great Lakes, 319 U.S., at 299, 301, 63 S. Ct. 1070, 87 L. Ed. 1407 (reserving judgment on TIA's application where comity precluded suit). See also Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 431, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 (2007)(federal court has flexibility to choose among threshold grounds for dismissal).13The District Court and Court of Appeals concluded that our decision in Hibbs placed the controversy outside the TIA's domain. That conclusion, we note, bears reassessment in light of this opinion's discussion of the significant differences between Hibbs and this case.

 * * * 

For the reasons stated, the Sixth Circuit's judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

We here decide that  the timeliness provision in the federal habeas corpus statute is subject to equitable tolling. See Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d). We also consider its application in this case. In the Court of Appeals' view, when a petitioner seeks to excuse a late filing on the basis of his attorney's unprofessional conduct, that conduct, even if it is “negligent” or “grossly negligent,” cannot “rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct” that would warrant equitable tolling unless the petitioner offers “proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth.” 539 F.3d 1334, 1339 (CA11 2008)(per curiam). In our view, this standard is too rigid. See Irwin v. Department of Veterans  Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990); see also Lawrence v. Florida, 549 U.S. 327, 336, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924 (2007). We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.

I 

AEDPA states that  “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.” § 2244(d)(1). It also says that  “[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction . . . review” is “pending shall not be counted” against the 1-year period. § 2244(d)(2).

On January 19, 2006, Albert Holland filed a pro se habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Both Holland (the petitioner) and the State of Florida (the respondent) agree that, unless equitably tolled, the statutory limitations period applicable to Holland's petition expired approximately five weeks before the petition was filed. See Brief for Respondent 9, and n. 7; Brief for Petitioner 5, and n. 4. Holland asked the District Court to toll the limitations period for equitable reasons. We shall set forth in some detail the record facts that underlie Holland's claim.

A 

In 1997, Holland was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed that judgment. Holland v. State, 773 So. 2d 1065 (2000). On October 1, 2001, this Court denied Holland's petition for certiorari. 534 U.S. 834, 122 S. Ct. 83, 151 L. Ed. 2d 46. And on that date--the date that our denial of the petition ended further direct review of Holland's conviction--the 1-year AEDPA limitations clock began to run. See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U.S. 113, 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475 (2009).

Thirty-seven days later, on November 7, 2001, Florida appointed attorney Bradley Collins to represent Holland in all  state and federal postconviction proceedings. Cf. Fla. Stat. §§ 27.710, 27.711(2) (2007). By September 19, 2002--316 days after his appointment and 12 days before the 1-year AEDPA limitations period expired--Collins, acting on Holland's behalf, filed a motion for postconviction relief in the state trial court. Cf. Brief for Respondent 9, n. 7. That filing automatically stopped the running of the AEDPA limitations period, § 2244(d)(2), with, as we have said, 12 days left on the clock.

For the next three years, Holland's petition remained pending in the state courts. During that time, Holland wrote Collins letters asking him to make certain that all of his claims would be preserved for any subsequent federal habeas corpus review. Collins wrote back, stating, “I would like to reassure you that we are aware of state-time limitations and federal exhaustion requirements.” App. 55. He also said that he would “presen[t] . . . to the . . . federal courts” any of Holland's claims that the state courts denied. Ibid. In a second letter Collins added, “should your Motion for Post-Conviction Relief be denied” by the state courts, “your state habeas corpus claims will then be ripe for presentation in a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court.” Id., at 61.

In mid-May 2003, the state trial court denied Holland relief, and Collins  appealed that denial to the Florida Supreme Court. Almost two years later, in February 2005, the Florida Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case. See 539 F.3d, at 1337. But during that 2-year period, relations between Collins and Holland began to break down. Indeed, between April 2003 and January 2006, Collins communicated with Holland only three times--each time by letter. See No. 1:06-cv-20182-PAS (SD Fla., Apr. 27, 2007), p. 7, n. 6 (hereinafter District Court opinion), App. 91, n. 6.

Holland, unhappy with this lack of communication, twice wrote to the Florida Supreme Court, asking it to remove Collins from his case. In the second letter, filed on June 17,  2004, he said that he and Collins had experienced “a complete breakdown in communication.” App. 160. Holland informed the court that Collins had “not kept [him] updated on the status of [his] capital case” and that Holland had “not seen or spoken to” Collins “since April 2003.” Id., at 150. He wrote, "Mr. Collins has [abandoned] [me]” and said, “[I have] no idea what is going on with [my] capital case on appeal.” Id., at 152. He added that “Collins has never made any reasonable effort to establish any relationship of trust or confidence with [me],” id., at 155, and stated that he “does not trust” or have “any confidence in Mr. Collin's ability to represent [him],” id., at 152. Holland concluded by asking that Collins be “dismissed (removed) off his capital case” or that he be given a hearing in order to demonstrate Collins' deficiencies. Id., at 155, 161. The State responded that Holland could not file any pro se papers with the court while he was represented by counsel, including papers seeking new counsel. Id., at 42-45. The Florida Supreme Court agreed and denied Holland's requests. Id., at 46.

During this same period Holland wrote various letters to the Clerk of the Florida Supreme Court. In the last of these he wrote, “[I]f I had a competent, conflict-free, postconviction, appellate attorney representing me, I would not have to write you this letter. I'm not trying to get on your nerves. I just would like to know exactly what is happening with my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida.” Id., at 147. During that same time period, Holland also filed a complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar Association, but the complaint was denied. Id., at 65-67.

Collins argued Holland's appeal before the Florida Supreme Court on February 10, 2005. 539 F.3d, at 1337. Shortly thereafter, Holland wrote to Collins emphasizing the importance of filing a timely petition for habeas corpus in federal court once the Florida Supreme Court issued its ruling. Specifically, on March 3, 2005, Holland wrote:

“Dear Mr. Collins, P. A.: “How are you? Fine I hope.“I write this letter to ask that you please write me back, as soon as possible to let me know what the status of my case is on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida.“If the Florida Supreme Court denies my [postconviction] and State Habeas Corpus appeals, please file my 28 U.S.C. 2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition, before my deadline to file it runs out (expires).“Thank you very much.“Please have a nice day.” App. 210 (emphasis added).

 Collins did not answer this letter.

On June 15, 2005, Holland wrote again:

“Dear Mr. Collins:“How are you? Fine I hope.“On March 3, 2005 I wrote you a letter, asking that you let me know the status of my case on appeal to the Supreme Court of Florida.“Also, have you begun preparing my 28 U.S.C. § 2254 writ of Habeas Corpus petition? Please let me know, as soon as possible.“Thank you.” Id., at 212 (emphasis added).

But again, Collins did not reply.

Five months later, in November 2005, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decision denying Holland relief. Holland v. State,916 So. 2d 750(per curiam). Three weeks after that, on December 1, 2005, the court issued its mandate, making its decision final. 539 F.3d, at 1337. At that point, the AEDPA federal habeas clock again began to tick--with 12 days left on the 1-year meter. See Coates v. Byrd,211 F.3d 1225 (CA11 2000)(per curiam) (AEDPA clock restarts when state court completes postconviction review); Lawrence, 549 U.S. 327, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924 (same). Twelve days later, on December 13, 2005, Holland's AEDPA time limit expired.

 B 

Four weeks after the AEDPA time limit expired, on January 9, 2006, Holland, still unaware of the Florida Supreme Court ruling issued in his case two months earlier, wrote Collins a third letter:

“Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:“How are you? Fine I hope.“I write this letter to ask that you please let me know the status of my appeals before the Supreme Court of Florida. Have my appeals been decided yet?“Please send me the [necessary information] . . . so that I can determine when the deadline will be to file my 28 U.S.C. Rule 2254 Federal Habeas Corpus Petition, in accordance with all United States Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit case law and applicable 'Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,' if my appeals before the Supreme Court of Florida are denied.“Please be advised that I want to preserve my privilege to federal review of all of my state convictions and sentences.“Mr. Collins, would you please also inform me, as to which United States District Court my 28 U.S.C. Rule 2254 Federal Habeas Corpus Petition will have to be timely filed in and that court's address?“Thank you very much.” App. 214.

Collins did not answer.

Nine days later, on January 18, 2006, Holland, working in the prison library, learned for the first time that the Florida Supreme Court had issued a final determination in his case and that its mandate had issued--five weeks prior. 539 F.3d, at 1337. He immediately wrote out his own pro se federal habeas petition and mailed it to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida the next day. Ibid. The petition begins by stating,

  “Comes now Albert R. Holland, Jr., a Florida death row inmate and states that court appointed counsel has failed to undertake timely action to seek Federal Review in my case by filing a 28 U.S.C. Rule 2254 Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus on my behalf.” App. 181.

It then describes the various constitutional claims that Holland hoped to assert in federal court.

The same day that he mailed that petition, Holland received a letter from Collins telling him that Collins intended to file a petition for certiorari in this Court from the State Supreme Court's most recent ruling. Holland answered immediately:

“Dear Mr. Bradley M. Collins:. . . . .“Since recently, the Supreme Court of Florida has denied my [postconviction] and state writ of Habeas Corpus Petition. I am left to understand that you are planning to seek certiorari on these matters.“It's my understanding that the AEDPA time limitations is not tolled during discretionary appellate reviews, such as certiorari applications resulting from denial of state post conviction proceedings.“Therefore, I advise you not to file certiorari if doing so affects or jeopardizes my one year grace period as prescribed by the AEDPA.“Thank you very much.” Id., at 216 (some emphasis deleted).

Holland was right about the law. See Coates, supra, at 1226-1227 (AEDPA not tolled during pendency of petition for certiorari from judgment denying state postconviction review); accord, Lawrence v. Florida, 421 F.3d 1221, 1225 (CA11 2005), aff'd, 549 U.S., at 331-336, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924.

On January 26, 2006, Holland tried to call Collins from prison. But he called collect and Collins' office would not accept the call. App. 218. Five days later, Collins wrote to Holland and told him for the very first time that, as Collins understood AEDPA law, the limitations period applicable to Holland's federal habeas application had in fact expired in 2000--before Collins had begun to represent Holland. Specifically, Collins wrote:

“Dear Mr. Holland:“I am in receipt of your letter dated January 20, 2006 concerning operation of AEDPA time limitations. One hurdle in our upcoming efforts at obtaining federal habeas corpus relief will be that the one-year statutory time frame for filing such a petition began to run after the case was affirmed on October 5, 2000 [when your] Judgment and Sentence . . . were affirmed by the Florida Supreme Court. However, it was not until November 7, 2001, that I received the Order appointing me to the case. As you can see, I was appointed about a year after your case became final. . . .“[T]he AEDPA time-period [thus] had run before my appointment and therefore before your [postconviction] motion was filed.” Id., at 78-79 (emphasis added).

Collins was wrong about the law. As we have said, Holland's 1-year limitations period did not begin to run until this Court denied Holland's petition for certiorari from the state courts' denial of relief on direct review, which occurred on October 1, 2001. See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1)(A); Jimenez, 555  U.S., at 119, 129 S. Ct. 681, 172 L. Ed. 2d 475; Bond v. Moore, 309 F.3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002). And when Collins was appointed (on November 7, 2001) the AEDPA clock therefore had 328 days left to go.

Holland immediately wrote back to Collins, pointing this out.

“Dear Mr. Collins:“I received your letter dated January 31, 2006. You are incorrect in stating that 'the one-year statutory time frame for filing my 2254 petition began to run after my case was affirmed on October 5, 2000, by the Florida Supreme Court.' As stated on page three of [the recently filed] Petition for a writ of certiorari, October 1, 2001 is when the United States Supreme Court denied my initial petition for writ of certiorari and that is when my case became final. That meant that the time would be tolled once I filed my [postconviction] motion in the trial court.“Also, Mr. Collins you never told me that my time ran out (expired). I told you to timely file my 28 U.S.C. 2254 Habeas Corpus Petition before the deadline, so that I would not be time-barred.“You never informed me of oral arguments or of the Supreme Court of Florida's November 10, 2005 decision denying my postconviction appeals. You never kept me informed about the status of my case, although you told me that you would immediately inform me of the court's decision as soon as you heard anything.“Mr. Collins, I filed a motion on January 19, 2006 [in federal court] to preserve my rights, because I did not want to be time-barred. Have you heard anything about the aforesaid motion? Do you know what the status of aforesaid motion is?“Mr. Collins, please file my 2254 Habeas Petition immediately. Please do not wait any longer, even though it will be untimely filed at least it will be filed without wasting anymore time. (valuable time).“Again, please file my 2254 Petition at once.“Your letter is the first time that you have ever mentioned anything to me about my time had run out, before you were appointed to represent me, and that my one-year started to run on October 5, 2000.“Please find out the status of my motion that I filed on January 19, 2006 and let me know.“Thank you very much.” App. 222-223.

Collins did not answer this letter. Nor did he file a federal habeas petition as Holland requested.

 On March 1, 2006, Holland filed another complaint against Collins with the Florida Bar Association. See Record, Doc. 41, Exh. 1, p. 8. This time the bar asked Collins to respond, which he did, through his own attorney, on March 21. Id., at 2. And the very next day, over three months after Holland's AEDPA statute of limitations had expired, Collins mailed a proposed federal habeas petition to Holland, asking him to review it. See id., Doc. 20, Exh. W.

But by that point Holland had already filed a pro se motion in the District Court asking that Collins be dismissed as his attorney. App. 192. The State responded to that request by arguing once again that Holland could not file a pro se motion seeking to have Collins removed while he was represented by counsel, i.e., represented by Collins. See id., at 47-51. But this time the court considered Holland's motion, permitted Collins to withdraw from the case, and appointed a new lawyer for Holland. See Record, Docs. 9-10, 17-18, 22. And it also received briefing on whether the circumstances of the case justified the equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period for a sufficient period of time (approximately five weeks) to make Holland's petition timely.

C 

After considering the briefs, the Federal District Court held that the facts did not warrant equitable tolling and that consequently Holland's petition was untimely. The court, noting that Collins had prepared numerous filings on Holland's behalf in the state courts, and suggesting that Holland was a difficult client, intimated, but did not hold, that Collins' professional conduct in the case was at worst merely “negligent.” See District Court opinion 7-8, App. 90-93. But the court rested its holding on an alternative rationale: It wrote that, even if Collins' “behavior could be characterized as an 'extraordinary circumstance,' ” Holland “did not seek any help from the court system to find out the date [the] mandate issued denying his state habeas petition, nor  did he seek aid from 'outside supporters.' ” Id., at 8, App. 92. Hence, the court held, Holland did not “demonstrate” the “due diligence” necessary to invoke “equitable tolling.” Ibid.

On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that Holland's habeas petition was untimely. The Court of Appeals first agreed with Holland that “ '[e]quitable tolling can be applied to . . . AEDPA's statutory deadline.' 539 F.3d, at 1338 (quoting Helton v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, 259 F.3d 1310, 1312 (CA11 2001)). But it also held that equitable tolling could not be applied in a case, like Holland's, that involves no more than “[p]ure professional negligence” on the part of a petitioner's attorney because such behavior can never constitute an “extraordinary circumstance.” 539 F.3d, at 1339. The court wrote:

“We will assume that Collins's alleged conduct is negligent, even grossly negligent. But in our view, no allegation of lawyer negligence or of failure to meet a lawyer's standard of care--in the absence of an allegation and proof of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer's part--can rise to the level of egregious attorney misconduct that would entitle Petitioner to equitable tolling.” Ibid.

Holland made “no allegation” that Collins had made a “knowing or reckless factual misrepresentation,” or that he exhibited “dishonesty,” “divided loyalty,” or “mental impairment.” Ibid. Hence, the court held, equitable tolling was per se inapplicable to Holland's habeas petition. The court did not address the District Court's ruling with respect to Holland's diligence.

Holland petitioned for certiorari. Because the Court of Appeals' application of the equitable tolling doctrine to instances of professional misconduct conflicts with the approach taken by other Circuits, we granted the petition. Compare 539 F.3d 1334 (case below) with, e.g.,Baldayaque v. United States, 338 F.3d 145, 152-153 (CA2 2003) (applying a less categorical approach); Spitsyn v. Moore, 345 F.3d 796, 801-802 (CA9 2003) (same).

II 

We have not decided whether AEDPA's statutory limitations period may be tolled for equitable reasons. See Lawrence, 549 U.S., at 336, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924; Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408, 418, n. 8, 125 S. Ct. 1807, 161 L. Ed. 2d 669 (2005). Now, like all 11 Courts of Appeals that have considered the question, we hold that § 2244(d)is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate cases. See Neverson v. Farquharson,366 F.3d 32, 41 (CA1 2004); Smith v. McGinnis,208 F.3d 13, 17 (CA2 2000)(per curiam);Miller v. New Jersey Dept. of Corrections,145 F.3d 616, 617 (CA3 1998); Harris v. Hutchinson, 209 F.3d 325, 329-330 (CA4 2000); Davis v. Johnson,158 F.3d 806, 810 (CA5 1998); McClendon v. Sherman,329 F.3d 490, 492 (CA6 2003); Taliani v. Chrans,189 F.3d 597, 598 (CA7 1999); Moore v. United States,173 F.3d 1131, 1134 (CA8 1999); Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. for Central Dist. of Cal.,128 F.3d 1283, 1289 (CA9 1997); Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (CA10 1998); Sandvik v. United States,177 F.3d 1269, 1272 (CA11 1999)(per curiam).

We base our conclusion on the following considerations. First,  the AEDPA “statute of limitations defense . . . is not 'jurisdictional.' Day v. McDonough, 547 U.S. 198, 205, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2006). It does not set forth “an inflexible rule requiring dismissal whenever” its “clock has run.” Id., at 208, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376. See also id., at 213, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“We have repeatedly stated that the enactment of time-limitation periods such as that in § 2244(d), without further elaboration, produces defenses that are nonjurisdictional and thus subject to waiver and forfeiture” (citing cases)); Brief for Respondent 22 (describing AEDPA limitations period as “non-jurisdictional”).

We have previously made clear that  a nonjurisdictional federal statute of limitations is normally subject to a “rebuttable  presumption” in favor “of equitable tolling.” Irwin, 498 U.S., at 95-96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435; see also Young v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 49, 122 S. Ct. 1036, 152 L. Ed. 2d 79 (2002) (“It is hornbook law that limitations periods are 'customarily subject to “equitable tolling” ' ” (quoting Irwin, supra, at 95, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435)).

In the case of AEDPA, the presumption's strength is reinforced by the fact that “ 'equitable principles' ” have traditionally “ 'governed' ” the substantive law of habeas corpus, Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 693, 128 S. Ct. 2207, 171 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2008), for we will “not construe a statute to displace courts' traditional equitable authority absent the 'clearest command,' Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 340, 120 S. Ct. 2246, 147 L. Ed. 2d 326 (2000)(quotingCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 705, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979)). The presumption's strength is yet further reinforced by the fact that Congress enacted AEDPA after this Court decided Irwin and therefore was likely aware that courts, when interpreting AEDPA's timing provisions, would apply the presumption. See, e.g.,Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.S. 633, 648, 130 S. Ct. 1784, 176 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010)

Second, the statute here differs significantly from the statutes at issue in United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.S. 347, 117 S. Ct. 849, 136 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1997), and United States v. Beggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 118 S. Ct. 1862, 141 L. Ed. 2d 32 (1998), two cases in which we held that Irwin's presumption had been overcome. In Brockamp, we interpreted a statute of limitations that was silent on the question of equitable tolling as foreclosing application of that doctrine. But in doing so we emphasized that the statute at issue (1) “se[t] forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form”; (2) used “highly detailed” and “technical” language “that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions”; (3) “reiterate[d] its limitations several times in several different ways”; (4) related to an “underlying subject matter,” nationwide tax collection, with respect to which the practical consequences of permitting tolling would have been substantial; and (5) would, if tolled, “require tolling, not only procedural limitations, but also substantive limitations on the amount of recovery--a kind of tolling for which we . . . found  no direct precedent.” 519 U.S., at 350-352, 117 S. Ct. 849, 136 L. Ed. 2d 818. And in Beggerly we held that Irwin's presumption was overcome where (1) the 12-year statute of limitations at issue was “unusually generous” and (2) the underlying claim “deal[t] with ownership of land” and thereby implicated landowners' need to “know with certainty what their rights are, and the period during which those rights may be subject to challenge.” 524 U.S., at 48-49, 118 S. Ct. 1862, 141 L. Ed. 2d 32.

By way of contrast, AEDPA's statute of limitations, unlike the statute at issue in Brockamp, does not contain language that is "unusually emphatic,” nor does it “reiterat[e]” its time limitation. Neither would application of equitable tolling here affect the “substance” of a petitioner's claim. Moreover, in contrast to the 12-year limitations period at issue in Beggerly, AEDPA's limitations period is not particularly long. And unlike the subject matters at issue in both Brockamp and Beggerly--tax collection and land claims--AEDPA's subject matter, habeas corpus, pertains to an area of the law where equity finds a comfortable home. See Munaf, supra, at 693, 128 S. Ct. 2207, 171 L. Ed. 2d 1. In short, AEDPA's 1-year limit reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations. See Calderon, supra, at 1288.

Respondent, citing Brockamp, argues that AEDPA should be interpreted to foreclose equitable tolling because the statute sets forth “explicit exceptions to its basic time limits” that do “not include 'equitable tolling.' 519 U.S., at 351, 117 S. Ct. 849, 136 L. Ed. 2d 818; see Brief for Respondent 27.  The statute does contain multiple provisions relating to the events that trigger its running. See § 2244(d)(1); Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 529, 123 S. Ct. 1072, 155 L. Ed. 2d 88 (2003); see also Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446, 450 (CA7 1990) (?We must . . . distinguish between the accrual of the plaintiff's claim and the tolling of the statute of limitations . . .”); Wims v. United States,225 F.3d 186, 190 (CA2 2000) (same); Wolin v. Smith Barney Inc.,83 F.3d 847, 852 (CA7 1996) (same). And we concede that it is silent as to equitable tolling while containing one provision  that expressly refers to a different kind of tolling. See § 2244(d)(2) (stating that “[t]he time during which” a petitioner has a pending request for state postconviction relief “shall not be counted toward” his “period of limitation” under AEDPA). But the fact that Congressexpressly referred to tolling during state collateral review proceedings is easily explained without rebutting the presumption in favor of equitable tolling. A petitioner cannot bring a federal habeas claim without first exhausting state remedies--a process that frequently takes longer than one year. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 102 S. Ct. 1198, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379 (1982); § 2254(b)(1)(A). Hence, Congress had to explain how the limitations statute accounts for the time during which such state proceedings are pending. This special need for an express provision undermines any temptation to invoke the interpretive maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius (to include one item (i.e., suspension during state-court collateral review) is to exclude other similar items (i.e., equitable tolling)). See Young,supra, 122 S. Ct. 1036, 152 L. Ed. 2d 79 (rejecting claim that an “express tolling provision, appearing in the same subsection as the [limitations] period, demonstrates a statutory intent not to toll the [limitations] period”).

Third, and finally, we disagree with respondent that equitable tolling undermines AEDPA's basic purposes. We recognize that  AEDPA seeks to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process. See Day, 547 U.S., at 205-206, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376; Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 337, 123 S. Ct. 1029, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931 (2003). But AEDPA seeks to do so without undermining basic habeas corpus principles and while seeking to harmonize the new statute with prior law, under which a petition's timeliness was always determined under equitable principles. See Slack v. McDaniel,529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000) (“AEDPA's present provisions . . . incorporate earlier habeas corpus principles”); see also Day,547 U.S., at 202, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376; id., at 214, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376 (Scalia, J., dissenting); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 24.2, pp. 1123-1136 (5th ed. 2005).  When Congress codified new rules governing this previously judicially managed area of law, it did so without losing sight of the fact that the “writ of habeas corpus plays a vital role in protecting constitutional rights.” Slack,529 U.S., at 483, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542. It did not seek to end every possible delay at all costs. Cf. id., at 483-488, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542. The importance of the Great Writ, the only writ explicitly protected by the Constitution, Art. I, § 9, cl. 2, along with congressional efforts to harmonize the new statute with prior law, counsels hesitancy before interpreting AEDPA's statutory silence as indicating a congressional intent to close courthouse doors that a strong equitable claim would ordinarily keep open.

For these reasons we conclude that neither AEDPA's textual characteristics nor the statute's basic purposes “rebut” the basic presumption set forth in Irwin. And we therefore join the Courts of Appeals in holding that § 2244(d) is subject to equitable tolling.

We have previously made clear that  a “petitioner” is “entitled to equitable tolling” only if he shows “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way” and prevented timely filing. Pace, 544  U.S., at 418, 125 S. Ct. 1807, 161 L. Ed. 2d 669 (emphasis deleted). In this case, the “extraordinary circumstances” at issue involve an attorney's failure to satisfy professional standards of care. The Court of Appeals held that, where that is so, even attorney conduct that is “grossly negligent” can never warrant tolling absent “bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, mental impairment or so forth on the lawyer's part.” 539 F.3d, at 1339. But in our view, the Court of Appeals' standard is too rigid.

We have said that  courts of equity “must be governed by rules and precedents no less than the courts of law.” Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U.S. 314, 323, 116 S. Ct. 1293, 134 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). But we have also made clear that often the “exercise of a court's equity powers . . . must be  made on a case-by-case basis.” Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 375, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964). In emphasizing the need for “flexibility,” for avoiding “mechanical rules,” Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396, 66 S. Ct. 582, 90 L. Ed. 743 (1946), we have followed a tradition in which courts of equity have sought to “relieve hardships which, from time to time, arise from a hard and fast adherence” to more absolute legal rules, which, if strictly applied, threaten the “evils of archaic rigidity,” Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 248, 64 S. Ct. 997, 88 L. Ed. 1250, 1944 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 675 (1944). The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable procedure” enables courts “to meet new situations [that] demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to correct . . . particular injustices.” Ibid. (permitting postdeadline filing of bill of review). Taken together, these cases recognize that courts of equity can and do draw upon decisions made in other similar cases for guidance. Such courts exercise judgment in light of prior precedent, but with awareness of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.

We recognize that, in the context of procedural default, we have previously stated, without qualification, that a petitioner “must 'bear the risk of attorney error.' Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 752-753, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991). But Coleman was “a case about federalism,” id., at 726, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640, in that it asked whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner's failure to comply with a state court's procedural rules, notwithstanding the state court's determination that its own rules had been violated.  Equitable tolling, by contrast, asks whether federal courts may excuse a petitioner's failure to comply with federal timing rules, an inquiry that does not implicate a state court's interpretation of state law. Cf. Lawrence, 549 U.S., at 341, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Holland does not argue that his attorney's misconduct provides a substantive ground for relief, cf. § 2254(i), nor is this a case that asks whether AEDPA's statute of limitations should be recognized at all, cf. Day, supra, at 209, 126 S. Ct. 1675, 164 L. Ed. 2d 376. Rather, this case asks  how equity should be applied once the statute is recognized. And given equity's resistance to rigid rules, we cannot read Coleman as requiring a per se approach in this context.

In short, no pre-existing rule of law or precedent demands a rule like the one set forth by the Eleventh Circuit in this case. That rule is difficult to reconcile with more general equitable principles in that it fails to recognize that, at least sometimes, professional misconduct that fails to meet the Eleventh Circuit's standard could nonetheless amount to egregious behavior and create an extraordinary circumstance that warrants equitable tolling. And, given the long history of judicial application of equitable tolling, courts can easily find precedents that can guide their judgments. Several lower courts have specifically held that unprofessional attorney conduct may, in certain circumstances, prove “egregious” and can be “extraordinary” even though the conduct in question may not satisfy the Eleventh Circuit's rule. See, e.g.,Nara v. Frank,264 F.3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering hearing as to whether client who was “effectively abandoned” by lawyer merited tolling); Calderon,128 F.3d, at 1289 (allowing tolling where client was prejudiced by a last minute change in representation that was beyond his control); Baldayaque,338 F.3d, at 152-153 (finding that where an attorney failed to perform an essential service, to communicate with the client, and to do basic legal research, tolling could, under the circumstances, be warranted); Spitsyn,345 F.3d, at 800-802 (finding that “extraordinary circumstances” may warrant tolling where lawyer denied client access to files, failed to prepare a petition, and did not respond to his client's communications); United States v. Martin, 408 F.3d 1089, 1096 (CA8 2005) (client entitled to equitable tolling where his attorney retained files, made misleading statements, and engaged in similar conduct).

We have previously held that  “a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,” Irwin,498 U.S., at 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435, such as a simple “miscalculation” that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline, Lawrence, supra, at 336, 127 S. Ct. 1079, 166 L. Ed. 2d 924, does not warrant equitable tolling. But the case before us does not involve, and we are not considering, a “garden variety claim” of attorney negligence. Rather, the facts of this case present far more serious instances of attorney misconduct. And, as we have said, although the circumstances of a case must be “extraordinary” before equitable tolling can be applied, we hold that such circumstances are not limited to those that satisfy the test that the Court of Appeals used in this case.

IV 

The record facts that we have set forth in Part I of this opinion suggest that this case may well be an “extraordinary” instance in which petitioner's attorney's conduct constituted far more than “garden variety” or “excusable neglect.” To be sure, Collins failed to file Holland's petition on time and appears to have been unaware of the date on which the limitations period expired--two facts that, alone, might suggest simple negligence. But, in these circumstances, the record facts we have elucidated suggest that the failure amounted to more: Here, Collins failed to file Holland's federal petition on time despite Holland's many letters that repeatedly emphasized the importance of his doing so. Collins apparently did not do the research necessary to find out the proper filing date, despite Holland's letters that went so far as to identify the applicable legal rules. Collins failed to inform Holland in a timely manner about the crucial fact that the Florida Supreme Court had decided his case, again despite Holland's many pleas for that information. And Collins failed to communicate with his client over a period of years, despite various pleas from Holland that Collins respond to his letters.

A group of teachers of legal ethics tells us that these various failures violated fundamental canons of professional responsibility, which require attorneys to perform reasonably competent legal work, to communicate with their clients, to  implement clients' reasonable requests, to keep their clients informed of key developments in their cases, and never to abandon a client. See Brief for Legal Ethics Professors et al. as Amici Curiae (describing ethical rules set forth in case law, the Restatements of Agency, the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers (1998), and in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct (2009)). And in this case, the failures seriously prejudiced a client who thereby lost what was likely his single opportunity for federal habeas review of the lawfulness of his imprisonment and of his death sentence.

We do not state our conclusion in absolute form, however, because more proceedings may be necessary. The District Court rested its ruling not on a lack of extraordinary circumstances, but rather on a lack of diligence--a ruling that respondent does not defend. See Brief for Respondent 38, n. 19; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43, 52. We think that the District Court's conclusion was incorrect.  The diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is “ 'reasonable diligence,' ” see, e.g.,Lonchar,517 U.S., at 326, 116 S. Ct. 1293, 134 L. Ed. 2d 440, not “ ' “maximum feasible diligence,” ' ” Starns v. Andrews,524 F.3d 612, 618 (CA5 2008) (quoting Moore v. Knight, 368 F.3d 936, 940 (CA7 2004)). Here, Holland not only wrote his attorney numerous letters seeking crucial information and providing direction; he also repeatedly contacted the state courts, their clerks, and the Florida State Bar Association in an effort to have Collins--the central impediment to the pursuit of his legal remedy--removed from his case. And, the very day that Holland discovered that his AEDPA clock had expired due to Collins' failings, Holland prepared his own habeas petition pro se and promptly filed it with the District Court.

Because the District Court erroneously relied on a lack of diligence, and because the Court of Appeals erroneously relied on an overly rigid per se approach, no lower court has yet considered in detail the facts of this case to determine whether they indeed constitute extraordinary circumstances  sufficient to warrant equitable relief. We are “[m]indful that  this is a court of final review and not first view.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.S. 103, 110, 122 S. Ct. 511, 151 L. Ed. 2d 489 (2001)(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). And we also recognize the prudence, when faced with an “equitable, often fact-intensive” inquiry, of allowing the lower courts “to undertake it in the first instance.” Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 540, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Thus, because we conclude that the District Court's determination must be set aside, we leave it to the Court of Appeals to determine whether the facts in this record entitle Holland to equitable tolling, or whether further proceedings, including an evidentiary hearing, might indicate that respondent should prevail.

The judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Scalia announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, IV, and V, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and III, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join.

We consider a claim that the decision of a State's court of last resort took property without just compensation in violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as applied against the States through the Fourteenth, see Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 383-384, 114 S. Ct. 2309, 129 L. Ed. 2d 304 (1994).

 Generally speaking, state law defines property interests, Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 164, 118 S. Ct. 1925, 141 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1998), including property rights in navigable waters and the lands underneath them, see United States v. Cress, 243 U.S. 316, 319-320, 37 S. Ct. 380, 61 L. Ed. 746 (1917); St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. St. Paul Water Comm'rs, 168 U.S. 349, 358-359, 18 S. Ct. 157, 42 L. Ed. 497 (1897). InFlorida, the State owns in trust for the public the land permanently submerged beneath navigable waters and the foreshore (the land between the low-tide line and the mean high-water line). Fla. Const., Art. X, § 11; Broward v. Mabry, 58 Fla. 398, 407-409, 50 So. 826, 829-830 (1909). Thus, the mean high-water line (the average reach of high tide over the preceding 19 years) is the ordinary boundary between private beachfront, or littoral1Many cases and statutes use “riparian” to mean abutting any body of water. The Florida Supreme Court, however, has adopted a more precise usage whereby “riparian” means abutting a river or stream and “littoral” means abutting an ocean, sea, or lake. Walton Cty. v. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1105, n. 3 (2008). When speaking of the Florida law applicable to this case, we follow the Florida Supreme Court's terminology. property, and state-owned  land. See Miller v. Bay-To-Gulf, Inc., 141 Fla. 452, 458-460, 193 So. 425, 427-428 (1940)(per curiam);Fla. Stat. §§ 177.27(14)-(15), 177.28(1) (2007).

 Littoral owners have, in addition to the rights of the public, certain “special rights” with regard to the water and the foreshore, Broward, 58 Fla., at 410, 50 So., at 830, rights which Florida considers to be property, generally akin to easements, see ibid.;Thiesen v. Gulf, F. & A. R. Co.,75 Fla. 28, 57, 78, 78 So. 491, 500, 507 (1918) (on rehearing). These include the right of access to the water, the right to use the water for certain purposes, the right to an unobstructed view of the water, and the right to receive accretions and relictions to the littoral property. Id., at 58-59, 78 So., at 501; Board of Trustees of Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Sand Key Assoc., Ltd., 512 So. 2d 934, 936 (Fla. 1987). This is generally in accord with well-established common law, although the precise property rights vary among jurisdictions. Compare Broward, supra, at 409-410, 50 So., at 830, with 1 J. Lewis, Law of Eminent Domain § 100 (3d ed. 1909); 1 H. Farnham, Law of Waters and Water Rights § 62, pp. 278-280 (1904) (hereinafter Farnham).

At the center of this case is the right to accretions and relictions.  Accretions are additions of alluvion (sand, sediment, or other deposits) to waterfront land; relictions are lands once covered by water that become dry when the water recedes. F. Maloney, S. Plager, & F. Baldwin, Water Law and Administration: The Florida Experience § 126, pp. 385-386 (1968) (hereinafter Maloney); 1 Farnham § 69, at 320. (For simplicity's sake, we shall refer to accretions and relictions collectively as accretions, and the process whereby they occur as accretion.) In order for an addition to dry land to qualify as an accretion, it must have occurred gradually and imperceptibly--that is, so slowly that one could not see the change occurring, though over time the difference became apparent. Sand Key, supra, at 936; County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 90 U.S. 46, 23 Wall. 46, 66-67, 23 L. Ed. 59 (1874). When, on the other hand, there is a “sudden or perceptible loss of or  addition to land by the action of the water or a sudden change in the bed of a lake or the course of a stream,” the change is called an avulsion. Sand Key, supra, at 936; see also 1 Farnham § 69, at 320.

 In Florida, as at common law, the littoral owner automatically takes title to dry land added to his property by accretion; but formerly submerged land that has become dry land by avulsion continues to belong to the owner of the seabed (usually the State). See, e.g., Sand Key, supra, at 937; Maloney § 126.6, at 392; 2 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 261-262 (1766) (hereinafter Blackstone). Thus, regardless of whether an avulsive event exposes land previously submerged or submerges land previously exposed, the boundary between littoral property and sovereign land does not change; it remains (ordinarily) what was the mean high-water line before the event. See Bryant v. Peppe, 238 So. 2d 836, 838-839 (Fla. 1970); J. Gould, Law of Waters § 158, p. 290 (1883). It follows from this that, when a new strip of land has been added to the shore by avulsion, the littoral owner has no right to subsequent accretions. Those accretions no longer add to his property, since the property abutting the water belongs not to him but to the State. See Maloney § 126.6, at 393; 1 Farnham § 71a, at 328.

B 

In 1961, Florida's Legislature passed the Beach and Shore Preservation Act, 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61-246, as amended, Fla. Stat. §§ 161.011-161.45 (2007).  The Act establishes procedures for “beach restoration and nourishment projects,” § 161.088, designed to deposit sand on eroded beaches (restoration) and to maintain the deposited sand (nourishment). § 161.021(3), (4). A local government may apply to the Department of Environmental Protection (Department) for the funds and the necessary permits to restore a beach, see §§ 161.101(1), 161.041(1). When the project involves placing fill on the State's submerged lands, authorization is required from the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement  Trust Fund (Board) , see § 253.77(1), which holds title to those lands, § 253.12(1).

 Once a beach restoration “is determined to be undertaken,” the Board sets what is called “an erosion control line.” § 161.161(3)-(5). It must be set by reference to the existing mean high-water line, though in theory it can be located seaward or landward of that.2We assume, as the parties agree we should, that in this case the erosion-control line is the pre-existing mean high-water line. Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12. Respondents concede that, if the erosion-control line were established landward of that, the State would have taken property. Brief for Respondent Department et al. 15; Brief for Respondent Walton County et al. 6. See § 161.161(5). Much of the project work occurs seaward of the erosion-control line, as sand is dumped on what was once submerged land. See App. 87-88. The fixed erosion-control line replaces the fluctuating mean high-water line as the boundary between privately owned littoral property and state property. § 161.191(1). Once the erosion-control line is recorded, the common law ceases to increase upland property by accretion (or decrease it by erosion). § 161.191(2). Thus, when accretion to the shore moves the mean high-water line seaward, the property of beachfront landowners is not extended to that line (as the prior law provided), but remains bounded by the permanent erosion-control line. Those landowners “continue to be entitled,” however, “to all common-law riparian rights” other than the right to accretions. § 161.201.  If the beach erodes back landward of the erosion-control line over a substantial portion of the shoreline covered by the project, the Board may, on its own initiative, or must, if asked by the owners or lessees of a majority of the property affected, direct the agency responsible for maintaining the beach to return the beach to the condition contemplated by the project. If that is not done within a year, the project is canceled and the erosion-control line is null and void. § 161.211(2), (3). Finally, by regulation, if  the use of submerged land would “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” the project cannot proceed unless the local governments show that they own or have a property interest in the upland property adjacent to the project site. Fla. Admin. Code Rule 18-21.004(3)(b) (2009).

C 

In 2003, the city of Destin and Walton County applied for the necessary permits to restore 6.9 miles of beach within their jurisdictions that had been eroded by several hurricanes. The project envisioned depositing along that shore sand dredged from further out. See Walton Cty. v. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., 998 So. 2d 1102, 1106 (Fla. 2008). It would add about 75 feet of dry sand seaward of the mean high-water line (to be denominated the erosion-control line). The Department issued a notice of intent to award the permits, App. 27-41, and the Board approved the erosion-control line, id., at 49-50.

Petitioner here, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., is a nonprofit corporation formed by people who own beachfront property bordering the project area (we shall refer to them as Members). It brought an administrative challenge to the proposed project, see id., at 10-26, which was unsuccessful; the Department approved the permits. Petitioner then challenged that action in state court under the Florida Administrative Procedure Act, Fla. Stat. § 120.68 (2007). The District Court of Appeal for the First District concluded that, contrary to the Act's preservation of “'all common-law riparian rights,'” the order had eliminated two of the Members' littoral rights: (1) the right to receive accretions to their property; and (2) the right to have the contact of their property with the water remain intact. Save Our Beaches, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 27 So. 3d 48, 58 (2006) (emphasis deleted). This, it believed, would be an unconstitutional taking, which would “unreasonably infringe on riparian rights,” and therefore require the showing  under Fla. Admin. Code Rule 18-21.004(3)(b) that the local governments owned or had a property interest in the upland property. It set aside the Department's final order approving the permits and remanded for that showing to be made. 27 So. 3d, at 60. It also certified to the Florida Supreme Court the following question (as rephrased by the latter court):

“On its face, does the Beach and Shore Preservation Act unconstitutionally deprive upland owners of littoral rights without just compensation?”3The Florida Supreme Court seemingly took the question to refer to constitutionality under the Florida Constitution, which contains a clause similar to the Takings Clause of the Federal Constitution. Compare Fla. Const., Art. X, § 6, cl. (a), with U.S. Const., Amdt. 5.998 So. 2d, at 1105 (footnotes omitted).

The Florida Supreme Courtanswered the certified question in the negative, and quashed the First District's remand. Id., at 1121. It faulted the Court of Appeal for not considering the doctrine of avulsion, which it concluded permitted the State to reclaim the restored beach on behalf of the public. Id., at 1116-1118. It described the right to accretions as a future contingent interest, not a vested property right, and held that there is no littoral right to contact with the water independent of the littoral right of access, which the Act does not infringe. Id., at 1112, 1119-1120. Petitioner sought rehearing on the ground that the Florida Supreme Court's decision itself effected a taking of the Members' littoral rights contrary to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution.4We ordinarily do not consider an issue first presented to a state court in a petition for rehearing if the state court did not address it. See Adams v. Robertson, 520 U.S. 83, 89, n. 3, 117 S. Ct. 1028, 137 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1997)(per curiam). But where the state-court decision itself is claimed to constitute a violation of federal law, the state court's refusal to address that claim put forward in a petition for rehearing will not bar our review. See Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Sav. Co. v. Hill, 281 U.S. 673, 677-678, 50 S. Ct. 451, 74 L. Ed. 1107 (1930). The request for rehearing was denied. We granted certiorari, 557 U.S. 903, 129 S. Ct. 2792, 174 L. Ed. 2d 290 (2009).

A 

Before coming to the parties' arguments in the present case, we discuss some general principles of our takings jurisprudence.  The Takings Clause --“nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation,” U.S. Const., Amdt. 5 --applies as fully to the taking of a landowner's riparian rights as it does to the taking of an estate in land.5We thus need not resolve whether the right of accretion is an easement, as petitioner claims, or, as Florida claims, a contingent future interest. See Yates v. Milwaukee, 77 U.S. 497, 10 Wall. 497, 504, 19 L. Ed. 984 (1871). Moreover, though the classic taking is a transfer of property to the State or to another private party by eminent domain, the Takings Clause applies to other state actions that achieve the same thing. Thus, when the government uses its own property in such a way that it destroys private property, it has taken that property. See United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 261-262, 66 S. Ct. 1062, 90 L. Ed. 1206, 106 Ct. Cl. 854 (1946); Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 80 U.S. 166, 13 Wall. 166, 177-178, 20 L. Ed. 557 (1872). Similarly, our doctrine of regulatory takings “aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking.” Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 539, 125 S. Ct. 2074, 161 L. Ed. 2d 876 (2005). Thus, it is a taking when a state regulation forces a property owner to submit to a permanent physical occupation, Loretto v. Teleprompter  Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 425-426, 102 S. Ct. 3164, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868 (1982), or deprives him of all economically beneficial use of his property, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1992). Finally (and here we approach the situation before us), States effect a taking if they recharacterize as public property what was previously private property. See Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 163-165, 101 S. Ct. 446, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1980).

 The Takings Clause (unlike, for instance, the Ex Post Facto Clauses, see Art. I, § 9, cl. 3; § 10, cl. 1) is not addressed to the action of a specific branch or branches. It is concerned  simply with the act, and not with the governmental actor (“nor shall private property be taken” (emphasis added)). There is no textual justification for saying that the existence or the scope of a State's power to expropriate private property without just compensation varies according to the branch of government effecting the expropriation. Nor does common sense recommend such a principle. It would be absurd to allow a State to do by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat. See Stevens v. Cannon Beach, 510 U.S. 1207, 1211-1212, 114 S. Ct. 1332, 127 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).

Our precedents provide no support for the proposition that takings effected by the judicial branch are entitled to special treatment, and in fact suggest the contrary.PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,447 U.S. 74, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980), involved a decision of the California Supreme Court overruling one of its prior decisions which had held that the California Constitution's guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press, and of the right to petition the government, did not require the owner of private property to accord those rights on his premises. The appellants, owners of a shopping center, contended that their private property rights could not “be denied by invocation of a state constitutional provision or by judicial reconstruction of a State's laws of private property,” id., at 79, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (emphasis added). We held that there had been no taking, citing cases involving legislative and executive takings, and applying standard Takings Clause analysis. See id., at 82-84, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741. We treated the California Supreme Court's application of the constitutional provisions as a regulation of the use of private property, and evaluated whether that regulation violated the property owners' “right to exclude others,” id., at 80, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our opinion addressed only the claimed taking by the constitutional provision. Its failure to speak separately to the claimed taking by “judicial reconstruction of a State's laws of private property” certainly does not suggest that a taking  by judicial action cannot occur, and arguably suggests that the same analysis applicable to taking by constitutional provision would apply.

Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, supra, is even closer in point. There the purchaser of an insolvent corporation had interpleaded the corporation's creditors, placing the purchase price in an interest-bearing account in the registry of the Circuit Court of Seminole County, to be distributed in satisfaction of claims approved by a receiver.  The Florida Supreme Court construed an applicable statute to mean that the interest on the account belonged to the county, because the account was “considered 'public money,' Beckwith v. Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, 374 So. 2d 951, 952-953 (1979)(per curiam). We held this to be a taking. We noted that “[t]he usual and general rule is that any interest on an interpleaded and deposited fund follows the principal and is to be allocated to those who are ultimately to be the owners of that principal,” 449 U.S., at 162, 101 S. Ct. 446, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358. “Neither the Florida Legislature by statute, nor the Florida courts by judicial decree,” we said, “may accomplish the result the county seeks simply by recharacterizing the principal as 'public money.' " Id., at 164, 101 S. Ct. 446, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358.

 In sum, the Takings Clause bars the State from taking private property without paying for it, no matter which branch is the instrument of the taking. To be sure, the manner of state action may matter: Condemnation by eminent domain, for example, is always a taking, while a legislative, executive, or judicial restriction of property use may or may not be, depending on its nature and extent. But the particular state actor is irrelevant. If a legislature or a court declares that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists, it has taken that property, no less than if the State had physically appropriated it or destroyed its value by regulation. “[A] State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.” Ibid.

Justice Breyer's concurrence says that we need neither (1) to decide whether the judiciary can ever effect a taking, nor (2) to establish the standard for determining whether it has done so. See post, at 742-743, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 214-215 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The second part of this is surely incompatible with Justice Breyer's conclusion that the “Florida Supreme Court's decision in this case did not amount to a 'judicial taking.' ” Post, at 745, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 215. One cannot know whether a takings claim is invalid without knowing what standard it has failed to meet.6Thus, the landmark case of Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City,438 U.S. 104, 124-128, 138, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1978), held that there was no taking only after setting forth a multifactor test for determining whether a regulation restricting the use of property effects a taking. Which means that Justice Breyer must either (1) grapple with the artificial question of what would constitute a judicial taking if there were such a thing as a judicial taking (reminiscent of the perplexing question how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?), or (2) answer in the negative what he considers to be the “unnecessary” constitutional question whether there is such a thing as a judicial taking.

It is not true that deciding the constitutional question in this case contradicts our settled practice. To the contrary, we have often recognized the existence of a constitutional right, or established the test for violation of such a right (or both), and then gone on to find that the claim at issue fails. See, e.g., New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 333, 341-343, 105 S. Ct. 733, 83 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1985) (holding that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches and seizures conducted by public-school officials, establishing the standard for finding a violation, but concluding that the claim at issue failed); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 698-700, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984) (recognizing a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, establishing the test for its violation, but holding that the claim at issue failed); Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58-60, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) (holding that a Strickland claim can be brought to challenge a guilty plea, but rejecting the claim at issue); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 313-320, 326, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979) (recognizing a due process claim based on insufficiency of evidence, establishing the governing test, but concluding that the claim at issue failed); Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 390, 395-397, 47 S. Ct. 114, 71 L. Ed. 303, 4 Ohio Law Abs. 816 (1926) (recognizing that block zoning ordinances could constitute a taking, but holding that the challenged ordinance did not do so); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 241, 255-257, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979 (1897) (holding that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits uncompensated takings, but concluding that the court below made no errors of law in assessing just compensation). In constitutional-tort suits against public officials, we have found the defendants entitled to immunity only after holding that their action violated the Constitution. See, e.g., Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S. 603, 605-606, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 143 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1999). Indeed, up until last Term, we required federal courts to address the constitutional question before the immunity question. See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272 (2001), overruled by Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009)

“Assuming without deciding” would be less appropriate here than it was in many of those earlier cases, which established constitutional rights quite separate from any that had previously been acknowledged. Compared to Strickland's proclamation of a right to effective assistance of counsel, for example, proclaiming that a taking can occur through judicial action addresses a point of relative detail.

In sum, Justice Breyer cannot decide that petitioner's claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of. His agreement with Part IV of our opinion necessarily implies agreement with the test for a judicial taking (elaborated in Part II-A) which Part IV applies: whether the state court has “declare[d] that what was once an established right of private property no longer exists,” supra, at 715, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 197.  Justice Breyer must either agree with that standard or craft one of his own. And agreeing to or crafting a hypothetical standard for a hypothetical constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing (we have eschewed that course many times in the past) that Justice  might as well acknowledge the right as well. Or he could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical standard by denying the right. But embracing a standard while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and deciding this case while addressing neither the standard nor the right is quite impossible.

 Justice Breyer responds that he simply advocates resolving this case without establishing “the precise standard under which a party wins or loses.” Post, at 744, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 215 (emphasis added). But he relies upon no standard at all, precise or imprecise. He simply pronounces that this is not a judicial taking if there is such a thing as a judicial taking. The cases he cites to support this Queen-of-Hearts approach provide no precedent. In each of them the existence of the right in question was settled,7See Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.S. 139, 149-156, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (2010) (ineffective assistance of counsel); Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S. Ct. 549, 54 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978) (equal protection); Mercer v. Theriot, 377 U.S. 152, 155, 84 S. Ct. 1157, 12 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1964)(per curiam) (right to judgment notwithstanding the verdict where evidence is lacking). and we faced a choice between competing standards that had been applied by the courts.8See Spisak, supra, at 160, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595. Quilloin's cryptic rejection of the claim “[u]nder any standard of review,” 434 U.S., at 256, 98 S. Ct. 549, 54 L. Ed. 2d 511, could only refer to the various levels of scrutiny--such as “strict” or “rational basis”--that we had applied to equal-protection claims, see Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 8-9, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1967). And in Mercer, which found the evidence “sufficient under any standard which might be appropriate--state or federal,” 377 U.S., at 156, 84 S. Ct. 1157, 12 L. Ed. 2d 206, one of the parties had argued for an established standard under Louisiana law, and the other for an established federal standard. Compare Brief for Petitioner in Mercer v. Theriot, O. T. 1963, No. 336, pp. 18-22, with Brief for Respondent in Mercer v. Theriot, p. 5. We simply held that the right in question had not been infringed under any of them. There is no established right here, and no competing standards.

 C 

Like Justice Breyer's concurrence, Justice Kennedy's concludes that the Florida Supreme Court's action here does not meet the standard for a judicial taking, while purporting not to determine what is the standard for a judicial taking, or indeed whether such a thing as a judicial taking even exists. That approach is invalid for the reasons we have discussed.

Justice Kennedy says that we need not take what he considers the bold and risky step of holding that the Takings Clause applies to judicial action, because the Due Process Clause “would likely prevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at 737, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). He invokes the Due Process Clause “in both its substantive and procedural aspects,” post, at 735, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 209, not specifying which of his arguments relates to which.

The first respect in which Justice Kennedy thinks the Due Process Clause can do the job seems to sound in procedural due process. Because, he says, “[c]ourts, unlike the executive or legislature, are not designed to make policy decisions” about expropriation, “[t]he Court would be on strong footing in ruling that a judicial decision that eliminates or substantially changes established property rights” violates the Due Process Clause. Post, at 736, 737, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 210. Let us be clear what is being proposed here. This Court has held that the separation-of-powers principles that the Constitution imposes upon the Federal Government do not apply against the States. See Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U.S. 71, 83-84, 23 S. Ct. 28, 47 L. Ed. 79 (1902). But in order to avoid the bold and risky step of saying that the Takings Clause applies to all government takings, Justice Kennedy would have us use procedural due process to impose judicially crafted separation-of-powers limitations upon the States: Courts cannot be used to perform the governmental function of expropriation. The asserted reasons  for the due process limitation are that the legislative and executive branches “are accountable in their political capacity” for takings, post, at 734, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 209, and “[c]ourts . . . are not designed to make policy decisions” about takings, post, at 736, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 210. These reasons may have a lot to do with sound separation-of-powers principles that ought to govern a democratic society, but they have nothing whatever to do with the protection of individual rights that is the object of the Due Process Clause.

Of course even taking those reasons at face value, it is strange to proclaim a democracy deficit and lack of special competence for the judicial taking of an individual property right, when this Court has had no trouble deciding matters of much greater moment, contrary to congressional desire or the legislated desires of most of the States, with no special competence except the authority we possess to enforce the Constitution. In any case, our opinion does not trust judges with the relatively small power Justice Kennedy now objects to. It is we who propose setting aside judicial decisions that take private property; it is he who insists that judges cannot be so limited. Under his regime, the citizen whose property has been judicially redefined to belong to the State would presumably be given the Orwellian explanation: “The court did not take your property. Because it is neither politically accountable nor competent to make such a decision, it cannot take property.”

Justice Kennedy's injection of separation-of-powers principles into the Due Process Clause would also have the ironic effect of preventing the assignment of the expropriation function to the branch of government whose procedures are, by far, the most protective of individual rights. So perhaps even this first respect in which Justice Kennedy would have the Due Process Clause do the work of the Takings Clause pertains to Substantive, rather than procedural, due process. His other arguments undoubtedly pertain to that, as evidenced by his assertion that “[i]t is . . . natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting the power of courts  to eliminate or change established property rights,” post, at 736, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 210, his endorsement of the proposition that the Due Process Clause imposes “limits on government's ability to diminish property values by regulation,” ibid., and his contention that “the Due Process Clause would likely prevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at 737, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The first problem with using substantive due process to do the work of the Takings Clause is that we have held it cannot be done. “Where a particular Amendment 'provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection' against a particular sort of government behavior, 'that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of “substantive due process,” must be the guide for analyzing these claims.' Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994) (four-Justice plurality opinion) (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443 (1989)); see also 510  U.S., at 281, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree with the plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment without reference to more general considerations of due process”). The second problem is that we have held for many years (logically or not) that the “liberties” protected by substantive due process do not include economic liberties. See, e.g., Lincoln Fed. Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.S. 525, 536, 69 S. Ct. 251, 93 L. Ed. 212 (1949). Justice Kennedy's language (“If a judicial decision . . . eliminates an established property right, the judgment could be set aside as a deprivation of property without due process of law,” post, at 735, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 209) propels us back to what is referred to (usually deprecatingly) as “the Lochner era.” See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S 45, 56-58, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905). That is a step of much greater novelty, and much more unpredictable effect, than merely applying the Takings Clause to judicial action. And the third and last problem with using substantive due process is that either (1) it will not do all that the Takings Clause does, or (2) if it does all that the Takings Clause does, it will encounter the same supposed difficulties that Justice Kennedy finds troublesome.

We do not grasp the relevance of Justice Kennedy's speculation, post, at 739, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 212, that the Framers did not envision the Takings Clause would apply to judicial action. They doubtless did not, since the Constitution was adopted in an era when courts had no power to “change” the common law. See 1 Blackstone 69-70 (1765); Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451, 472-478, 121 S. Ct. 1693, 149 L. Ed. 2d 697 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Where the text they adopted is clear, however (“nor shall private property be taken for public use”), what counts is not what they envisioned but what they wrote. Of course even after courts, in the 19th century, did assume the power to change the common law, it is not true that the new “common-law tradition . . . allows for incremental modifications to property law,” post, at 736, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 210, so that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law,” post, at 738, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211. In the only sense in which this could be relevant to what we are discussing, that is an astounding statement. We are talking here about judicial elimination of established private property rights. If that is indeed a “common-law tradition,” Justice Kennedy ought to be able to provide a more solid example for it than the only one he cites, ibid., a state-court change (from “noxious” to “harmful”) of the test for determining whether a neighbor's vegetation is a tortious nuisance. Fancher v. Fagella, 274 Va. 549, 555-556, 650 S. E. 2d 519, 522 (2007). But perhaps he does not really mean that it is a common-law tradition to eliminate property rights, since he immediately follows his statement that “owners may reasonably expect or anticipate courts to make certain changes in property law” with the contradictory statement that “courts cannot abandon settled principles,” post, at 738, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211. If no “settled principl[e]” has been abandoned, it is hard to see how property law could have been “change[d],” rather than merely clarified.

 Justice Kennedy has added “two additional practical considerations that the Court would need to address before recognizing judicial takings,” post, at 740, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 212. One of them is simple and simply answered: the assertion that “it is unclear what remedy a reviewing court could enter after finding a judicial taking,” ibid.Justice Kennedy worries that we may only be able to mandate compensation. That remedy is even rare for a legislative or executive taking, and we see no reason why it would be the exclusive remedy for a judicial taking. If we were to hold that the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncompensated taking in the present case, we would simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the property in question. Justice Kennedy's other point, ibid.--that we will have to decide when the claim of a judicial taking must be asserted--hardly presents an awe-inspiring prospect. These, and all the other “difficulties,” post, at 734, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 208, “difficult questions,” post, at 737, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211, and “practical considerations” post, at 740, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 212, that Justice Kennedy worries may perhaps stand in the way of recognizing a judicial taking, are either nonexistent or insignificant.

Finally, we cannot avoid comment upon Justice Kennedy's donning of the mantle of judicial restraint--his assertion that it is we, and not he, who would empower the courts and encourage their expropriation of private property. He warns that if judges know that their action is covered by the Takings Clause, they will issue “sweeping new rule[s] to adjust the rights of property owners,” comfortable in the knowledge that their innovations will be preserved upon payment by the State. Post, at 738, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211. That is quite impossible. As we have said, if we were to hold that the Florida Supreme Court had effected an uncompensated taking in this case, we would not validate the taking by ordering Florida to pay compensation. We would simply reverse the Florida Supreme Court's judgment that the Beach and Shore Preservation Act can be applied to the Members' property. The  power to effect a compensated taking would then reside, where it has always resided, not in the Florida Supreme Court but in the Florida Legislature--which could either provide compensation or acquiesce in the invalidity of the offending features of the Act. Cf. Davis v. Michigan Dep't of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 817-818, 109 S. Ct. 1500, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1989). The only realistic incentive that subjection to the Takings Clause might provide to any court would be the incentive to get reversed, which in our experience few judges value.

Justice Kennedy, however, while dismissive of the Takings Clause, places no other constraints on judicial action. He puts forward some extremely vague applications of substantive due process, and does not even say that they (whatever they are) will for sure apply. (“It is thus natural to read the Due Process Clause as limiting the power of courts to eliminate or change established property rights,” post, at 736, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 210; “courts . . . may not have the power to eliminate established property rights by judicial decision,” ibid.; “the Due Process Clause would  likely prevent a State from doing by judicial decree what the Takings Clause forbids it to do by legislative fiat,” post, at 737, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 211 (internal quotation marks omitted); we must defer applying the Takings Clause until “[i]f and when future cases show that the usual principles, including constitutional principles that constrain the judiciary like due process, are somehow inadequate to protect property owners,” post, at 742, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 214.)

Moreover, and more importantly, Justice Kennedy places no constraints whatever upon this Court. Not only does his concurrence only think about applying substantive due process; but because substantive due process is such a wonderfully malleable concept, see, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 562, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003) (referring to “liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions”), even a firm commitment to apply it would be a firm commitment to nothing in particular. Justice Kennedy's desire to substitute substantive due process for the Takings Clause suggests, and the rest of what he writes confirms, that what holds him back from giving the Takings Clause its natural meaning is not the intrusiveness of applying it to judicial action, but the definiteness of doing so; not a concern to preserve the powers of the States' political branches, but a concern to preserve this Court's discretion to say that property may be taken, or may not be taken, as in the Court's view the circumstances suggest. We must not say that we are bound by the Constitution never to sanction judicial elimination of clearly established property rights. Where the power of this Court is concerned, one must never say never. See, e.g., Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267, 302-305, 124 S. Ct. 1769, 158 L. Ed. 2d 546 (2004) (plurality opinion); Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 750-751, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The great attraction of substantive due process as a substitute for more specific constitutional guarantees is that it never means never--because it never means anything precise.

III 

Respondents put forward a number of arguments which contradict, to a greater or lesser degree, the principle discussed above, that the existence of a taking does not depend upon the branch of government that effects it. First, in a case claiming a judicial taking they would add to our normal takings inquiry a requirement that the court's decision have no “fair and substantial basis.” This is taken from our jurisprudence dealing with the question whether a state-court decision rests upon adequate and independent state grounds, placing it beyond our jurisdiction to review. See E. Gressman, K. Geller, S. Shapiro, T. Bishop, & E. Hartnett, Supreme Court Practice, ch. 3.26, p. 222 (9th ed. 2007). To ensure that there is no “evasion” of our authority to review federal questions, we insist that the nonfederal ground of decision have “fair support.” Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U.S. 537, 540, 50 S. Ct. 401, 74 L. Ed. 1023 (1930); see also Ward v. Board of Comm'rs of Love Cty., 253 U.S. 17, 22-23, 40 S. Ct. 419, 64 L. Ed. 751 (1920). A test designed to determine whether there has been an evasion is not obviously appropriate for determining whether there has been a taking of property. But if it is to be extended there it must mean (in the present context) that there is a “fair and substantial basis” for believing that petitioner's Members did not have a property right to future accretions which the Act would take away. This is no different, we think, from our requirement that petitioner's Members must prove the elimination of an established property right.9 Justice Breyer complains that we do not set forth “procedural limitations or canons of deference” to restrict federal-court review of state-court property decisions. See post, at 744, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 215. (1) To the extent this is true it is unsurprising, but (2) fundamentally, it is false: (1) It is true that we make our own determination, without deference to state judges, whether the challenged decision deprives the claimant of an established property right. That is unsurprising because it is what this Court does when determining state-court compliance with all constitutional imperatives. We do not defer to the judgment of state judges in determining whether, for example, a state-court decision has deprived a defendant of due process or subjected him to double jeopardy. (2) The test we have adopted, however (deprivation of an established property right), contains within itself a considerable degree of deference to state courts. A property right is not established if there is doubt about its existence; and when there is doubt we do not make our own assessment but accept the determination of the state court.

Next, respondents argue that federal courts lack the knowledge of state law required to decide whether a judicial decision that purports merely to clarify property rights has instead taken them. But federal courts must often decide what state property rights exist in nontakings contexts, see, e.g., Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577-578, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972) (Due Process Clause). And indeed they must decide it to resolve claims that legislative or executive action has effected a taking. For example, a regulation that deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of his property is not a taking if the restriction “inhere[s] in the title itself, in the restrictions that background principles  of the State's law of property and nuisance already place upon land ownership.” Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1029, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798.  A constitutional provision that forbids the uncompensated taking of property is quite simply insusceptible of enforcement by federal courts unless they have the power to decide what property rights exist under state law.

Respondents also warn us against depriving common-law judging of needed flexibility. That argument has little appeal when directed against the enforcement of a constitutional guarantee adopted in an era when, as we said supra, at 722, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 201, courts had no power to “change” the common law. But in any case, courts have no peculiar need of flexibility. It is no more essential that judges be free to overrule prior cases that establish property entitlements than that state legislators be free to revise pre-existing statutes that confer property entitlements, or agency-heads pre-existing regulations that do so. And insofar as courts merely clarify and elaborate property entitlements that were previously unclear, they cannot be said to have taken an established property right.

Finally, the city and county argue that applying the Takings Clause to judicial decisions would force lower federal courts to review final state-court judgments, in violation of the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-416, 44 S. Ct. 149, 68 L. Ed. 362 (1923); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S. Ct. 1303, 75 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1983). That does not necessarily follow. The finality principles that we regularly apply to takings claims, see Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City,473 U.S. 172, 186-194, 105 S. Ct. 3108, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1985), would require the claimant to appeal a claimed taking by a lower court to the state supreme court, whence certiorari would come to this Court. If certiorari were denied, the claimant would no more be able to launch a lower-court federal suit against the taking effected by the state supreme-court opinion than he would be able to launch such a suit against  a legislative or executive taking approved by the state supreme-court opinion; the matter would be res judicata. And where the claimant was not a party to the original suit, he would be able to challenge in federal court the taking effected by the state supreme-court opinion to the same extent that he would be able to challenge in federal court a legislative or executive taking previously approved by a state supreme-court opinion.

For its part, petitioner proposes an unpredictability test. Quoting Justice Stewart's concurrence in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 296, 88 S. Ct. 438, 19 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1967), petitioner argues that a judicial taking consists of a decision that “ 'constitutes a sudden change in state law, unpredictable in terms of relevant precedents.' ” See Brief for Petitioner 17, 34-50. The focus of petitioner's test is misdirected. What counts is not whether there is precedent for the allegedly confiscatory decision, but whether the property right allegedly taken was established. A “predictability of change” test would cover both too much and too little. Too much, because a judicial property decision need not be predictable, so long as it does not declare that what had been private property under established law no longer is. A decision that clarifies property entitlements (or the lack thereof) that were previously unclear might be difficult to predict, but it does not eliminate established property rights. And the predictability test covers too little, because a judicial elimination of established private-property rights that is foreshadowed by dicta or even by holdings years in advance is nonetheless a taking. If, for example, a state court held in one case, to which the complaining property owner was not a party, that it had the power to limit the acreage of privately owned real estate to 100 acres, and then, in a second case, applied that principle to declare the complainant's 101st acre to be public property, the State would have taken an acre from the complainant even though the decision was predictable.

 IV 

We come at last to petitioner's takings attack on the decision below. At the outset, respondents raise two preliminary points which need not detain us long. The city and the county argue that petitioner cannot state a cause of action for a taking because, though the Members own private property, petitioner itself does not; and that the claim is unripe because petitioner has not sought just compensation. Neither objection appeared in the briefs in opposition to the petition for writ of certiorari, and since neither is jurisdictional,10 Petitioner meets the two requirements necessary for an association to assert the Article III standing of its Members. SeeFood and Commercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555-557, 116 S. Ct. 1529, 134 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1996). And the claim here is ripe insofar as Article III standing is concerned, since (accepting petitioner's version of Florida law as true) petitioner has been deprived of property. we deem both waived. See this Court's Rule 15.2; cf. Oklahoma  City v. Tuttle, 471 U.S. 808, 815-816, 105 S. Ct. 2427, 85 L. Ed. 2d 791 (1985).

Petitioner argues that the Florida Supreme Court took two of the property rights of the Members by declaring that those rights did not exist: the right to accretions, and the right to have littoral property touch the water (which petitioner distinguishes from the mere right of access to the water).11 Petitioner raises two other claims that we do not directly address. First, petitioner tries to revive its challenge to the beach restoration project, contending that it (rather than the Florida Supreme Court's opinion) constitutes a taking. Petitioner's arguments on this score are simply versions of two arguments it makes against the Florida Supreme Court's opinion: that the Department has replaced the Members' littoral property rights with versions that are inferior because statutory; and that the Members previously had the right to have their property contact the water. We reject both, infra, at 732-733, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 208, and n. 12. Second, petitioner attempts to raise a challenge to the Act as a deprivation of property without due process. Petitioner did not raise this challenge before the Florida Supreme Court, and only obliquely raised it in the petition for certiorari. We therefore do not reach it. See Adams, 520 U.S., at 86-87, 117 S. Ct. 1028, 137 L. Ed. 2d 203 .Under petitioner's theory, because no prior Florida decision had said that the State's filling of submerged  tidal lands could have the effect of depriving a littoral owner of contact with the water and denying him future accretions, the Florida Supreme Court's judgment in the present case abolished those two easements to which littoral property owners had been entitled. This puts the burden on the wrong party. There is no taking unless petitioner can show that, before the Florida Supreme Court's decision, littoral-property owners had rights to future accretions and contact with the water superior to the State's right to fill in its submerged land. Though some may think the question close, in our view the showing cannot be made.

Two core principles of Florida property law intersect in this case. First,  the State as owner of the submerged land adjacent to littoral property has the right to fill that land, so long as it does not interfere with the rights of the public and the rights of littoral landowners. See Hayes v. Bowman, 91 So. 2d 795, 799-800 (Fla. 1957) (right to fill conveyed by State to private party); State ex rel. Buford v. Tampa, 88 Fla. 196, 210-211, 102 So. 336, 341 (1924) (same). Second, as we described supra, at 709, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 193,  if an avulsion exposes land seaward of littoral property that had previously been submerged, that land belongs to the State even if it interrupts the littoral owner's contact with the water. See Bryant, 238 So. 2d, at 837, 838-839. The issue here is whether there is an exception to this rule when the State is the cause of the avulsion. Prior law suggests there is not. In Martin v. Busch, 93 Fla. 535, 112 So. 274 (1927), the Florida Supreme Court held that when the State drained water from a lakebed belonging to the State, causing land that was formerly below the mean high-water line to become dry land, that land continued to belong to the State. Id., at 574, 112 So., at 287; see also Bryant, supra, at 838-839 (analogizing the situation in Martin to an avulsion). “ 'The riparian rights doctrine of accretion and reliction,' ” the Florida Supreme Court later explained, “ 'does not apply to such lands.' Bryant, supra, at 839 (quoting Martin, supra, at 578, 112 So., at 288 (Brown, J., concurring)). This is not surprising, as there can be no accretions to land that no longer abuts the water.

Thus, Florida law as it stood before the decision below allowed the State to fill in its own seabed, and the resulting sudden exposure of previously submerged land was treated like an avulsion for purposes of ownership. The right to accretions was therefore subordinate to the State's right to fill. Thiesen v. Gulf, Florida & AlabamaR. Co. suggests the same result. That case involved a claim by a riparian landowner that a railroad's state-authorized filling of submerged land and construction of tracks upon it interfered with the riparian landowners' rights to access and to wharf out to a shipping channel. The Florida Supreme Court determined that the claimed right to wharf out did not exist in Florida, and that therefore only the right of access was compensable. 75 Fla., at 58-65, 78 So., at 501-503. Significantly, although the court recognized that the riparian-property owners had rights to accretion, see id., at 64-65, 78  So., at 502-503, the only rights it even suggested would be infringed by the railroad were the right of access (which the plaintiff had claimed) and the rights of view and use of the water (which it seems the plaintiff had not claimed), see id., at 58-59, 78, 78 So., at 501, 507.

The Florida Supreme Court decision before us is consistent with these background principles of state property law. Cf. Lucas, 505 U.S., at 1028-1029, 112 S. Ct. 2886, 120 L. Ed. 2d 798; Scranton v. Wheeler, 179 U.S. 141, 163, 21 S. Ct. 48, 45 L. Ed. 126 (1900). It did not abolish the Members' right to future accretions, but merely held that the right was not implicated by the beach-restoration project, because the doctrine of avulsion applied. See 998 So. 2d, at 1117, 1120-1121. The Florida Supreme Court's opinion describes beach restoration as the reclamation by the State of the public's land, just as Martin had described the lake drainage in that case. Although the opinion does not cite Martin and is not always clear on this point, it suffices that its characterization of the littoral right to accretion is consistent with Martin and the other relevant principles of Florida law we have discussed.

What we have said shows that the rule of Sand Key, which petitioner repeatedly invokes, is inapposite. There the Florida Supreme Court held that an artificial accretion does not change the right of a littoral-property owner to claim the accreted land as his own (as long as the owner did not cause the accretion himself). 512 So. 2d, at 937-938. The reason Martin did not apply, Sand Key explained, is that the drainage that had occurred in Martin did not lower the water level by “ 'imperceptible degrees,' ” and so did not qualify as an accretion. 512 So. 2d, at 940-941.

The result under Florida law may seem counter-intuitive. After all, the Members' property has been deprived of its character (and value) as oceanfront property by the State's artificial creation of an avulsion. Perhaps state-created avulsions ought to be treated differently from other avulsions insofar as the property right to accretion is concerned. But nothing in prior Florida law makes such a distinction, and Martin suggests, if it does not indeed hold, the contrary. Even if there might be different interpretations of Martin and other Florida property-law cases that would prevent this arguably odd result, we are not free to adopt them.  The Takings Clause only protects property rights as they are established under state law, not as they might have been established or ought to have been established. We cannot say that the Florida Supreme Court's decision eliminated a right of accretion established under Florida law.

Petitioner also contends that the State took the Members' littoral right to have their property continually maintain contact with the water. To be clear, petitioner does not allege that the State relocated the property line, as would have happened if the erosion-control line were landward of the old mean high-water line (instead of identical to it). Petitioner argues instead that the Members have a separate right for the boundary of their property to be always the mean high-water line. Petitioner points to dicta in Sand Key that refers to “the right to have the property's contact with the water remain intact,” 512 So. 2d, at 936. Even there, the right was included in the definition of the right to access, ibid., which is consistent with the Florida Supreme Court's later description that “there is no independent right of contact with the water” but it “exists to preserve the upland owner's core littoral right of access to the water,” 998 So. 2d, at 1119. Petitioner's expansive interpretation of the dictum in Sand Key would cause it to contradict the clear Florida law governing avulsion. One cannot say that the Florida Supreme Court contravened established property law by rejecting it.12 Petitioner also argues that the Members' other littoral rights have been infringed because the Act replaces their common-law rights with inferior statutory versions. Petitioner has not established that the statutory versions are inferior; and whether the source of a property right is the common law or a statute makes no difference, so long as the property owner continues to have what he previously had.

V 

Because the Florida Supreme Court's decision did not contravene the established property rights of petitioner's Members, Florida has not violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The judgment of the Florida Supreme Court is therefore affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens took no part in the decision of this case.


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case involves the assertion by a government employer of the right, in circumstances to be described, to read text messages sent and received on a pager the employer owned and issued to an employee. The employee contends that the privacy of the messages is protected by the ban on “unreasonable searches and seizures” found in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513 (1961). Though the case touches issues of far reaching significance, the Court concludes it can be resolved by settled principles determining when a search is reasonable.

A 

The city of Ontario (City) is a political subdivision of the State of California. The case arose out of incidents in 2001 and 2002 when respondent Jeff Quon was employed by the Ontario Police Department (OPD). He was a police sergeant and member of OPD's Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team. The City, OPD, and OPD's Chief, Lloyd Scharf, are petitioners here. As will be discussed, two respondents share the last name Quon. In this opinion “Quon” refers to Jeff Quon, for the relevant events mostly revolve around him.

In October 2001, the City acquired 20 alphanumeric pagers capable of sending and receiving text messages. Arch Wireless Operating Company provided wireless service for the pagers. Under the City's service contract with Arch Wireless, each pager was allotted a limited number of characters  sent or received each month. Usage in excess of that amount would result in an additional fee. The City issued pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order to help the SWAT Team mobilize and respond to emergency situations.

Before acquiring the pagers, the City announced a “Computer Usage, Internet and E-Mail Policy” (Computer Policy) that applied to all employees. Among other provisions, it specified that the City “reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice. Users should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 151, 152a. In March 2000, Quon signed a statement acknowledging that he had read and understood the Computer Policy.

The Computer Policy did not apply, on its face, to text messaging. Text messages share similarities with e-mails, but the two differ in an important way. In this case, for instance, an e-mail sent on a City computer was transmitted through the City's own data servers, but a text message sent on one of the City's pagers was transmitted using wireless radio frequencies from an individual pager to a receiving station owned by Arch Wireless. It was routed through Arch Wireless' computer network, where it remained until the recipient's pager or cellular telephone was ready to receive the message, at which point Arch Wireless transmitted the message from the transmitting station nearest to the recipient. After delivery, Arch Wireless retained a copy on its computer servers. The message did not pass through computers owned by the City.

Although the Computer Policy did not cover text messages by its explicit terms, the City made clear to employees, including Quon, that the City would treat text messages the same way as it treated e-mails. At an April 18, 2002, staff meeting at which Quon was present, Lieutenant Steven Duke, the OPD officer responsible for the City's contract  with Arch Wireless, told officers that messages sent on the pagers “are considered e-mail messages. This means that [text] messages would fall under the City's policy as public information and [would be] eligible for auditing.” App. 30. Duke's comments were put in writing in a memorandum sent on April 29, 2002, by Chief Scharf to Quon and other City personnel.

Within the first or second billing cycle after the pagers were distributed, Quon exceeded his monthly text message character allotment. Duke told Quon about the overage, and reminded him that messages sent on the pagers were “considered e-mail and could be audited.” Id., at 40. Duke said, however, that “it was not his intent to audit [an] employee's text messages to see if the overage [was] due to work related transmissions.” Ibid.Duke suggested that Quon could reimburse the City for the overage fee rather than have Duke audit the messages. Quon wrote a check to the City for the overage. Duke offered the same arrangement to other employees who incurred overage fees.

Over the next few months, Quon exceeded his character limit three or four times. Each time he reimbursed the City. Quon and another officer again incurred overage fees for their pager usage in August 2002. At a meeting in October, Duke told Scharf that he had become “ 'tired of being a bill collector.' ” Id., at 91. Scharf decided to determine whether the existing character limit was too low--that is, whether officers such as Quon were having to pay fees for sending work-related messages--or if the overages were for personal messages. Scharf told Duke to request transcripts of text messages sent in August and September by Quon and the other employee who had exceeded the character allowance.

At Duke's request, an administrative assistant employed by OPD contacted Arch Wireless. After verifying that the City was the subscriber on the accounts, Arch Wireless provided the desired transcripts. Duke reviewed the transcripts  and discovered that many of the messages sent and received on Quon's pager were not work related, and some were sexually explicit. Duke reported his findings to Scharf, who, along with Quon's immediate supervisor, reviewed the transcripts himself. After his review, Scharf referred the matter to OPD's internal affairs division for an investigation into whether Quon was violating OPD rules by pursuing personal matters while on duty.

The officer in charge of the internal affairs review was Sergeant Patrick McMahon. Before conducting a review, McMahon used Quon's work schedule to redact the transcripts in order to eliminate any messages Quon sent while off duty. He then reviewed the content of the messages Quon sent during work hours. McMahon's report noted that Quon sent or received 456 messages during work hours in the month of August 2002, of which no more than 57 were work related; he sent as many as 80 messages during a single day at work; and on an average workday, Quon sent or received 28 messages, of which only 3 were related to police business. The report concluded that Quon had violated OPD rules. Quon was allegedly disciplined.

B 

Raising claims under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983; 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq., popularly known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA); and California law, Quon filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Arch Wireless and an individual not relevant here were also named as defendants. Quon was joined in his suit by another plaintiff who is not a party before this Court and by the other respondents, each of whom exchanged text messages with Quon during August and September 2002: Jerilyn Quon, Jeff Quon's then-wife, from whom he was separated; April Florio, an OPD employee with whom Jeff Quon was romantically involved; and Steve Trujillo, another member of the OPD SWAT Team.  Among the allegations in the complaint was that petitioners violated respondents' Fourth Amendment rights and the SCA by obtaining and reviewing the transcript of Jeff Quon's pager messages and that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted Arch Wireless' motion for summary judgment on the SCA claim but denied petitioners' motion for summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment claims. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co.,445 F. Supp. 2d 1116 (CD Cal. 2006). Relying on the plurality opinion in O'Connor v. Ortega, 480 U.S. 709, 711, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1987), the District Court determined that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of his text messages. Whether the audit of the text messages was nonetheless reasonable, the District Court concluded, turned on Chief Scharf's intent: “[I]f the purpose for the audit was to determine if Quon was using his pager to 'play games' and 'waste time,' then the audit was not constitutionally reasonable”; but if the audit's purpose “was to determine the efficacy of the existing character limits to ensure that officers were not paying hidden work-related costs, . . . no constitutional violation occurred.” 445 F. Supp. 2d, at 1146.

The District Court held a jury trial to determine the purpose of the audit. The jury concluded that Scharf ordered the audit to determine the efficacy of the character limits. The District Court accordingly held that petitioners did not violate the Fourth Amendment. It entered judgment in their favor.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co., Inc.,529 F.3d 892 (2008). The panel agreed with the District Court that Jeff Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages but disagreed with the District Court about whether the search was reasonable. Even though the search was conducted for “a legitimate work-related rationale,”  the Court of Appeals concluded, it “was not reasonable in scope.” Id., at 908. The panel disagreed with the District Court's observation that “there were no less-intrusive means” that Chief Scharf could have used ?to verify the efficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding on [respondents'] Fourth Amendment rights.” Id., at 908-909. The opinion pointed to a “host of simple ways” that the chief could have used instead of the audit, such as warning Quon at the beginning of the month that his future messages would be audited, or asking Quon himself to redact the transcript of his messages. Id., at 909. The Court of Appeals further concluded that Arch Wireless had violated the SCA by turning over the transcript to the City.

The Ninth Circuit denied a petition for rehearing en banc. Quon v. Arch Wireless Operating Co.,554 F.3d 769 (2009). Judge Ikuta, joined by six other Circuit Judges, dissented. Id., at 774-779. Judge Wardlaw concurred in the denial of rehearing, defending the panel's opinion against the dissent. Id., at 769-774.

This Court granted the petition for certiorari filed by the City, OPD, and Chief Scharf challenging the Court of Appeals' holding that they violated the Fourth Amendment. 558 U.S. 1090, 130 S. Ct. 1011, 175 L. Ed. 2d 617 (2009). The petition for certiorari filed by Arch Wireless challenging the Ninth Circuit's ruling that Arch Wireless violated the SCA was denied. USA Mobility Wireless, Inc. v. Quon,558 U.S. 1091, 130 S. Ct. 1011, 175 L. Ed. 2d 618 (2009).

II 

 The Fourth Amendment states: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . .” It is well settled that the Fourth Amendment's protection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investigations. Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 530, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1967). “The Amendment guarantees the privacy, dignity, and security of  persons against certain arbitrary and invasive acts by officers of the Government,” without regard to whether the government actor is investigating crime or performing another function. Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 613-614, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989). The Fourth Amendment applies as well when the Government acts in its capacity as an employer. Treasury  Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 665, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 103 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1989).

The Court discussed this principle in O'Connor. There a physician employed by a state hospital alleged that hospital officials investigating workplace misconduct had violated his Fourth Amendment rights by searching his office and seizing personal items from his desk and filing cabinet. All Members of the Court agreed with the general principle that  “[i]ndividuals do not lose Fourth Amendment rights merely because they work for the government instead of a private employer.” 480 U.S., at 717, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 731, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 737, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). A majority of the Court further agreed that “ 'special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,' ” make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable for government employers. Id., at 725, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (plurality opinion) (quoting New Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U.S. 325, 351, 105 S. Ct. 733, 83 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1985) (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment)); 480 U.S., at 732, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (quoting same).

The O'Connor Court did disagree on the proper analytical framework for Fourth Amendment claims against government employers. A four-Justice plurality concluded that the correct analysis has two steps. First, because “some government offices may be so open to fellow employees or the public that no expectation of privacy is reasonable,” id., at 718, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714, a court must consider “[t]he operational realities of the workplace” in order to determine whether an employee's Fourth Amendment rights are implicated, id., at 717, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. On this view, “the question whether an employee has a reasonable  expectation of privacy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis.” Id., at 718, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. Next, where an employee has a legitimate privacy expectation, an employer's intrusion on that expectation “for noninvestigatory, work-related purposes, as well as for investigations of work-related misconduct, should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances.” Id., at 725-726, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714.

Justice Scalia, concurring in the judgment, outlined a different approach. His opinion would have dispensed with an inquiry into “operational realities” and would conclude “that the offices of government employees . . . are covered by Fourth Amendment protections as a general matter.” Id., at 731, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. But he would also have held “that government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules--searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context--do not violate the Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 732, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714.

Later, in the Von Raab decision, the Court explained that “operational realities” could diminish an employee's privacy expectations, and that this diminution could be taken into consideration when assessing the reasonableness of a workplace search. 489 U.S., at 671, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639. In the two decades since O'Connor, however, the threshold test for determining the scope of an employee's Fourth Amendment rights has not been clarified further. Here, though they disagree on whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy, both petitioners and respondents start from the premise that the O'Connor plurality controls. See Brief for Petitioners 22-28; Brief for Respondents 25-32. It is not necessary to resolve whether that premise is correct. The case can be decided by determining that the search was reasonable even assuming Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The two O'Connor approaches--the plurality's and Justice Scalia's--therefore lead to the same result here.

 III

A 

Before turning to the reasonableness of the search, it is instructive to note the parties' disagreement over whether Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The record does establish that OPD, at the outset, made it clear that pager messages were not considered private. The City's Computer Policy stated that “[u]sers should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using” City computers. App. to Pet. for Cert. 152. Chief Scharf's memo and Duke's statements made clear that this official policy extended to text messaging. The disagreement, at least as respondents see the case, is over whether Duke's later statements overrode the official policy. Respondents contend that because Duke told Quon that an audit would be unnecessary if Quon paid for the overage, Quon reasonably could expect that the contents of his messages would remain private.

At this point, were we to assume that inquiry into “operational realities” were called for, compare O'Connor, 480 U.S., at 717, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (plurality opinion), withid., at 730-731, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also id., at 737-738, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), it would be necessary to ask whether Duke's statements could be taken as announcing a change in OPD policy, and if so, whether he had, in fact or appearance, the authority to make such a change and to guarantee the privacy of text messaging. It would also be necessary to consider whether a review of messages sent on police pagers, particularly those sent while officers are on duty, might be justified for other reasons, including performance evaluations, litigation concerning the lawfulness of police actions, and perhaps compliance with state open records laws. See Brief for Petitioners 35-40 (citing Cal. Public Records Act, Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 6250 et seq. (West 2008)). These matters would all bear on the legitimacy of an employee's privacy expectation.

 The Court must proceed with care when considering the whole concept of privacy expectations in communi cations made on electronic equipment owned by a government employer. The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear. See, e.g., Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 48 S. Ct. 564, 72 L. Ed. 944 (1928), overruled by Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 353, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967). In Katz, the Court relied on its own knowledge and experience to conclude that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth. See id., at 360-361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (Harlan, J., concurring). It is not so clear that courts at present are on so sure a ground. Prudence counsels caution before the facts in the instant case are used to establish far-reaching premises that define the existence, and extent, of privacy expectations enjoyed by employees when using employer-provided communication devices.

Rapid changes in the dynamics of communication and information transmission are evident not just in the technology itself but in what society accepts as proper behavior. As one amici brief notes, many employers expect or at least tolerate personal use of such equipment by employees because it often increases worker efficiency. See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et al. 16-20. Another amicus points out that the law is beginning to respond to these developments, as some States have recently passed statutes requiring employers to notify employees when monitoring their electronic communications. See Brief for New York Intellectual Property Law Association 22 (citing Del. Code Ann., Tit. 19, § 705 (2005); Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 31-48d (West 2003)). At present, it is uncertain how workplace norms, and the law's treatment of them, will evolve.

Even if the Court were certain that the O'Connor plurality's approach were the right one, the Court would have difficulty predicting how employees' privacy expectations will be shaped by those changes or the degree to which society  will be prepared to recognize those expectations as reasonable. See 480 U.S., at 715, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. Cell phone and text message communications are so pervasive that some persons may consider them to be essential means or necessary instruments for self-expression, even self-identification. That might strengthen the case for an expectation of privacy. On the other hand, the ubiquity of those devices has made them generally affordable, so one could counter that employees who need cell phones or similar devices for personal matters can purchase and pay for their own. And employer policies concerning communications will of course shape the reasonable expectations of their employees, especially to the extent that such policies are clearly communicated.

A broad holding concerning employees' privacy expectations vis-á-vis employer-provided technological equipment might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted. It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds. For present purposes we assume several propositions, arguendo: First, Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages sent on the pager provided to him by the City; second, petitioners' review of the transcript constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment; and third, the principles applicable to a government employer's search of an employee's physical office apply with at least the same force when the employer intrudes on the employee's privacy in the electronic sphere.

B 

Even if Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, petitioners did not necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment by obtaining and reviewing the transcripts. Although as a general matter, warrantless searches “are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment,” there are “a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions” to that general rule. Katz, supra, at 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576. The Court has held that the “ 'special needs' ” of the workplace  justify one such exception. O'Connor, 480 U.S., at 725, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (plurality opinion); id., at 732, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Von Raab,489 U.S., at 666-667, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 103 L. Ed. 2d 685.

Under the approach of the O'Connor plurality,  when conducted for a “noninvestigatory, work-related purpos[e]” or for the “investigatio[n] of work-related misconduct,” a government employer's warrantless search is reasonable if it is “ 'justified at its inception' ” and if “ 'the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of' ” the circumstances giving rise to the search. 480 U.S., at 725-726, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. The search here satisfied the standard of the O'Connor plurality and was reasonable under that approach.

The search was justified at its inception because there were “reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search [was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose.” Id., at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. As a jury found, Chief Scharf ordered the search in order to determine whether the character limit on the City's contract with Arch Wireless was sufficient to meet the City's needs. This was, as the Ninth Circuit noted, a “legitimate work-related rationale.” 529 F.3d at 908. The City and OPD had a legitimate interest in ensuring that employees were not being forced to pay out of their own pockets for work-related expenses, or on the other hand that the City was not paying for extensive personal communications.

As for the scope of the search, reviewing the transcripts was reasonable because it was an efficient and expedient way to determine whether Quon's overages were the result of work-related messaging or personal use. The review was also not “ 'excessively intrusive.' O'Connor, supra, at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714 (plurality opinion). Although Quon had gone over his monthly allotment a number of times, OPD requested transcripts for only the months of August and September 2002. While it may have been reasonable as well for OPD to review transcripts of all the months in which Quon exceeded his  allowance, it was certainly reasonable for OPD to review messages for just two months in order to obtain a large enough sample to decide whether the character limits were efficacious. And it is worth noting that during his internal affairs investigation, McMahon redacted all messages Quon sent while off duty, a measure which reduced the intrusiveness of any further review of the transcripts.

Furthermore, and again on the assumption that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his messages,  the extent of an expectation is relevant to assessing whether the search was too intrusive. See Von Raab, supra, at 671, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 103 L. Ed. 2d 685; cf. Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 654-657, 115 S. Ct. 2386, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1995). Even if he could assume some level of privacy would inhere in his messages, it would not have been reasonable for Quon to conclude that his messages were in all circumstances immune from scrutiny. Quon was told that his messages were subject to auditing. As a law enforcement officer, he would or should have known that his actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his on-the-job communications. Under the circumstances, a reasonable employee would be aware that sound management principles might require the audit of messages to determine whether the pager was being appropriately used. Given that the City issued the pagers to Quon and other SWAT Team members in order to help them more quickly respond to crises--and given that Quon had received no assurances of privacy--Quon could have anticipated that it might be necessary for the City to audit pager messages to assess the SWAT Team's performance in particular emergency situations.

From OPD's perspective, the fact that Quon likely had only a limited privacy expectation, with boundaries that we need not here explore, lessened the risk that the review would intrude on highly private details of Quon's life. OPD's audit of messages on Quon's employer-provided pager was not nearly as intrusive as a search of his personal e-mail account  or pager, or a wiretap on his home phone line, would have been. That the search did reveal intimate details of Quon's life does not make it unreasonable, for under the circumstances a reasonable employer would not expect that such a review would intrude on such matters. The search was permissible in its scope.

The Court of Appeals erred in finding the search unreasonable. It pointed to a “host of simple ways to verify the efficacy of the 25,000 character limit . . . without intruding on [respondents'] Fourth Amendment rights.” 529 F.3d at 909. The panel suggested that Scharf “could have warned Quon that for the month of September he was forbidden from using his pager for personal communications, and that the contents of all of his messages would be reviewed to ensure the pager was used only for work-related purposes during that timeframe. Alternatively, if [OPD] wanted to review past usage, it could have asked Quon to count the characters himself, or asked him to redact personal messages and grant permission to [OPD] to review the redacted transcript.” Ibid.

This approach was inconsistent with controlling precedents.  This Court has “repeatedly refused to declare that only the 'least intrusive' search practicable can be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” Vernonia, supra, at 663, 115 S. Ct. 2386, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564; see also, e.g., Bd. of Educ. v. Earls, 536 U.S. 822, 837, 122 S. Ct. 2559, 153 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2002); Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 647, 103 S. Ct. 2605, 77 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1983). That rationale ?could raise insuperable barriers to the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers,” United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 557, n. 12, 96 S. Ct. 3074, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116 (1976), because “judges engaged in post hoc evaluations of government conduct can almost always imagine some alternative means by which the objectives of the government might have been accomplished,” Skinner, 489 U.S., at 629, n. 9, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). The analytic errors of the Court of Appeals in this case illustrate the necessity of  this principle. Even assuming there were ways that OPD could have performed the search that would have been less intrusive, it does not follow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.

Respondents argue that the search was per se unreasonable in light of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by giving the City the transcripts of Quon's text messages. The merits of the SCA claim are not before us. But even if the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the SCA forbade Arch Wireless from turning over the transcripts, it does not follow that petitioners' actions were unreasonable. Respondents point to no authority for the proposition that the existence of statutory protection renders a search per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. And the precedents counsel otherwise. See Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 168, 128 S. Ct. 1598, 170 L. Ed. 2d 559 (2008) (search incident to an arrest that was illegal under state law was reasonable); California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 43, 108 S. Ct. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988) (rejecting argument that if state law forbade police search of individual's garbage the search would violate the Fourth Amendment). Furthermore, respondents do not maintain that any OPD employee either violated the law himself or herself or knew or should have known that Arch Wireless, by turning over the transcript, would have violated the law. The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts.

Because the search was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose, and because it was not excessive in scope, the search was reasonable under the approach of the O'Connor plurality. 480 U.S., at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. For these same reasons--that the employer had a legitimate reason for the search, and that the search was not excessively intrusive in light of that justification--the Court also concludes that the search would be “regarded as reasonable and normal in the private-employer context” and would satisfy the approach of Justice Scalia's concurrence. Id., at 732, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed. 2d 714. The search was reasonable, and the Court of Appeals erred by holding to the contrary. Petitioners did not violate Quon's Fourth Amendment rights.

C 

Finally, the Court must consider whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Jerilyn Quon, Florio, and Trujillo, the respondents who sent text messages to Jeff Quon. Petitioners and respondents disagree whether a sender of a text message can have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a message he knowingly sends to someone's employer-provided pager. It is not necessary to resolve this question in order to dispose of the case, however. Respondents argue that because “the search was unreasonable as to Sergeant Quon, it was also unreasonable as to his correspondents.” Brief for Respondents 60 (some capitalization omitted; boldface deleted). They make no corollary argument that the search, if reasonable as to Quon, could nonetheless be unreasonable as to Quon's correspondents. See id., at 65-66. In light of this litigating position and the Court's conclusion that the search was reasonable as to Jeff Quon, it necessarily follows that these other respondents cannot prevail.

* * * 

Because the search was reasonable, petitioners did not violate respondents' Fourth Amendment rights, and the court below erred by concluding otherwise. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case involves an employer's claims against a local union and the union's international parent for economic damages  arising out of a 2004 strike. The claims turn in part on whether a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) containing a no-strike provision was validly formed during the strike period. The employer contends that it was, while the unions contend that it was not. Because the CBA contains an arbitration clause, we first address whether the parties' dispute over the CBA's ratification date was a matter for the District Court or an arbitrator to resolve. We conclude that it was a matter for judicial resolution. Next, we address whether the Court of Appeals erred in declining the employer's request to recognize a new federal cause of action under § 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a), for the international union's alleged tortious interference with the CBA. The Court of Appeals did not err in declining this request.

I 

Petitioner Granite Rock Company is a concrete and building materials company that has operated in California since 1900. Granite Rock employs approximately 800 employees under different labor contracts with several unions, including respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 287 (Local). Granite Rock and Local were parties to a 1999 CBA that expired in April 2004. The parties' attempt to negotiate a new CBA hit an impasse and, on June 9, 2004, Local members initiated a strike in support of their contract demands.1In deciding the arbitration question in this case we rely upon the terms of the CBA and the facts in the District Court record. In reviewing the judgment affirming dismissal of Granite Rock's tort claims against respondent International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) for failure to state a claim, we rely on the facts alleged in Granite Rock's Third Amended Complaint. See, e.g., H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 250, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989).

The strike continued until July 2, 2004, when the parties reached agreement on the terms of a new CBA. The CBA  contained a no-strike clause but did not directly address union members' liability for any strike-related damages Granite Rock may have incurred before the new CBA was negotiated but after the prior CBA had expired. At the end of the negotiating session on the new CBA, Local's business representative, George Netto, approached Granite Rock about executing a separate “back-to-work” agreement that would, among other things, hold union members harmless for damages incurred during the June 2004 strike. Netto did not make execution of such an agreement a condition of Local's ratification of the CBA, or of Local's decision to cease picketing. Thus, Local did not have a back-to-work or hold-harmless agreement in place when it voted to ratify the CBA on July 2, 2004.

Respondent IBT, which had advised Local throughout the CBA negotiations and whose leadership and members supported the June strike, opposed Local's decision to return to work without a back-to-work agreement shielding both Local and IBT members from liability for strike-related damages. In an effort to secure such an agreement, IBT instructed Local's members not to honor their agreement to return to work on July 5, and instructed Local's leaders to continue the work stoppage until Granite Rock agreed to hold Local and IBT members free from liability for the June strike. Netto demanded such an agreement on July 6, but Granite Rock refused the request and informed Local that the company would view any continued strike activity as a violation of the new CBA's no-strike clause. IBT and Local responded by announcing a companywide strike that involved numerous facilities and hundreds of workers, including members of IBT locals besides Local 287.

According to Granite Rock, IBT not only instigated this strike; it supported and directed it. IBT provided pay and benefits to union members who refused to return to work, directed Local's negotiations with Granite Rock, supported Local financially during the strike period with a $1.2 million  loan, and represented to Granite Rock that IBT had unilateral authority to end the work stoppage in exchange for a hold-harmless agreement covering IBT members within and outside Local's bargaining unit.

On July 9, 2004, Granite Rock sued IBT and Local in the District Court, seeking an injunction against the ongoing strike and strike-related damages. Granite Rock's complaint, originally and as amended, invoked federal jurisdiction under LMRA § 301(a), alleged that the July 6 strike violated Local's obligations under the CBA's no-strike provision, and asked the District Court to enjoin the strike because the hold-harmless dispute giving rise to the strike was an arbitrable grievance. See Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk's Union, 398 U.S. 235, 237-238, 253-254, 90 S. Ct. 1583, 26 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1970) (holding that federal courts may enjoin a strike where a CBA contemplates arbitration of the dispute that occasions the strike). The unions conceded that LMRA § 301(a) gave the District Court jurisdiction over the suit but opposed Granite Rock's complaint, asserting that the CBA was not validly ratified on July 2 (or at any other time relevant to the July 2004 strike) and, thus, its no-strike clause did not provide a basis for Granite Rock's claims challenging the strike.

The District Court initially denied Granite Rock's request to enforce the CBA's no-strike provision because Granite Rock was unable to produce evidence that the CBA was ratified on July 2. App. 203-213. Shortly after the District Court ruled, however, a Local member testified that Netto had put the new CBA to a ratification vote on July 2, and that the voting Local members unanimously approved the agreement. Based on this statement and supporting testimony from 12 other employees, Granite Rock moved for a new trial on its injunction and damages claims.

On August 22, while that motion was pending, Local conducted a second successful “ratification” vote on the CBA, and on September 13, the day the District Court was scheduled to hear Granite Rock's motion, the unions called off  their strike. Although their return to work mooted Granite Rock's request for an injunction, the District Court proceeded with the hearing and granted Granite Rock a new trial on its damages claims. The parties proceeded with discovery and Granite Rock amended its complaint, which already alleged federal2This Court has recognized a federal common-law claim for breach of a CBA under LMRA § 301(a). See, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.S. 448, 456, 77 S. Ct. 912, 1 L. Ed. 2d 972 (1957). claims for breach of the CBA against both Local and IBT, to add federal inducement of breach and interference with contract (hereinafter tortious interference) claims against IBT.

IBT and Local both moved to dismiss. Among other things, IBT argued that Granite Rock could not plead a federal tort claim under § 301(a) because that provision supports a federal cause of action only for breach of contract. The District Court agreed and dismissed Granite Rock's tortious interference claims. The District Court did not, however, grant Local's separate motion to send the parties' dispute over the CBA's ratification date to arbitration.3The CBA's ratification date is important to Granite Rock's underlying suit for strike damages. If the District Court correctly concluded that the CBA was ratified on July 2, Granite Rock could argue on remand that the July work stoppage violated the CBA's no-strike clause. The District Court held that whether the CBA was ratified on July 2 or August 22 was an issue for the court to decide, and submitted the question to a jury. The jury reached a unanimous verdict that Local ratified the CBA on July 2, 2004. The District Court entered the verdict and ordered the parties to proceed with arbitration on Granite Rock's breach-of-contract claims for strike-related damages.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. See 546 F.3d 1169 (2008). The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of Granite Rock's tortious interference claims against IBT. See id., at 1170-1175. But it disagreed with the District Court's determination that the date of the CBA's ratification was a matter for judicial resolution. See id., at 1176-1178. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the parties' dispute over this issue was governed by the CBA's arbitration clause because the clause clearly covered the related strike claims, the “national policy favoring arbitration” required that any ambiguity about the scope of the parties' arbitration clause be resolved in favor of arbitrability, and, in any event, Granite Rock had “implicitly” consented to arbitrate the ratification-date dispute “by suing under the contract.” Id., at 1178 (internal quotation marks omitted). We granted certiorari. See 557 U.S. 933, 129 S. Ct. 2865, 174 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009).

It is well settled in both commercial and labor cases that  whether parties have agreed to “submi[t] a particular dispute to arbitration” is typically an “ 'issue for judicial determination.' Howsam v. Dean  Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002) (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1986)); see John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 546-547, 84 S. Ct. 909, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1964). It is similarly well settled that  where the dispute at issue concerns contract formation, the dispute is generally for courts to decide. See, e.g., First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995) (“When deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter . . . courts generally . . . should apply ordinary . . . principles that govern the formation of contracts”); AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648-649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (explaining the settled rule in labor cases that “ 'arbitration is a matter of contract' ” and “arbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration”); Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 444, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006) (distinguishing treatment of the generally nonarbitral question whether an arbitration agreement was “ever concluded” from the question whether a  contract containing an arbitration clause was illegal when formed, which question we held to be arbitrable in certain circumstances).

These principles would neatly dispose of this case if the formation dispute here were typical. But it is not. It is based on when (not whether) the CBA that contains the parties' arbitration clause was ratified and thereby formed.4Although a union ratification vote is not always required for the provisions in a CBA to be considered validly formed, the parties agree that ratification was such a predicate here. See App. 349-351. And at the time the District Court considered Local's demand to send this issue to an arbitrator, Granite Rock, the party resisting arbitration, conceded both the formation and the validity of the CBA's arbitration clause.

These unusual facts require us to reemphasize the proper framework for deciding when disputes are arbitrable under our precedents. Under that framework,  a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute. See First Options, supra, at 943, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985; AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648-649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648. To satisfy itself that such agreement exists, the court must resolve any issue that calls into question the formation or applicability of the specific arbitration clause that a party seeks to have the court enforce. See, e.g., Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 561 U.S. 63, 68, 70, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 177 L. Ed. 2d 403 .Where there is no provision validly committing them to an arbitrator, see ante, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 577, these issues typically concern the scope of the arbitration clause and its enforceability. In addition, these issues always include whether the clause was agreed to, and may include when that agreement was formed.

A 

The parties agree that it was proper for the District Court to decide whether their ratification dispute was arbitrable.5Because neither party argues that the arbitrator should decide this question, there is no need to apply the rule requiring “ 'clear and unmistakable' ” evidence of an agreement to arbitrate arbitrability. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995) (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1986); alterations omitted). They disagree about whether the District Court answered the question correctly. Local contends that the District Court erred in holding that the CBA's ratification date was an issue for the court to decide. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the District Court's refusal to send that dispute to arbitration violated two principles of arbitrability set forth in our precedents. See 546 F.3d at 1177-1178.The first principle is that where, as here, parties concede that they have agreed to arbitrate some matters pursuant to an arbitration clause, the “law's permissive policies in respect to arbitration” counsel that “ ' any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.' First Options, supra, at 945, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985)); see 546 F.3d at 1177-1178 (citing this principle and the “national policy favoring arbitration” in concluding that arbitration clauses “are to be construed very broadly” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The second principle the Court of Appeals invoked is that this presumption of arbitrability applies even to disputes about the enforceability of the entire contract containing the arbitration clause, because at least in cases governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.,6We, like the Court of Appeals, discuss precedents applying the FAA because they employ the same rules of arbitrability that govern labor cases. See, e.g., AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648. Indeed, the rule that arbitration is strictly a matter of consent--and thus that courts must typically decide any questions concerning the formation or scope of an arbitration agreement before ordering parties to comply with it--is the cornerstone of the framework the Court announced in the Steelworkers Trilogy for deciding arbitrability disputes in LMRA cases. See Steelworkers v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 567-568, 80 S. Ct. 1343, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1403 (1960); Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 (1960); Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1424 (1960). courts must  treat the arbitration clause as severable from the contract in which it appears, and thus apply the clause to all disputes within its scope “ '[u]nless the [validity] challenge is to the arbitration clause itself' ” or the party “disputes the formation of [the] contract,” 546 F.3d at 1176 (quoting Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 445-446, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038); 546 F.3d at 1177, and n. 4 (explaining that it would treat the parties' arbitration clause as enforceable with respect to the ratification-date dispute because no party argued that the “clause is invalid in any way”).

Local contends that our precedents, particularly those applying the “ ' federal policy favoring arbitration of labor disputes,' ” permit no other result. Brief for Respondent Local, p. 15 (quoting Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U.S. 368, 377, 94 S. Ct. 629, 38 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1974)); see Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 10-13, 16-25. Local, like the Court of Appeals, overreads our precedents. The language and holdings on which Local and the Court of Appeals rely cannot be divorced from the first principle that underscores all of our arbitration decisions:  Arbitration is strictly “a matter of consent,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1989), and thus “is a way to resolve those disputes--but only those disputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration,” First Options, 514 U.S., at 943, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (emphasis added).7See also Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 57, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995); Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S. 213, 219-220, 105 S. Ct. 1238, 84 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1985); Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 511, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1974); AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648; Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 582, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409; United States v. Moorman, 338 U.S. 457, 462, 70 S. Ct. 288, 94 L. Ed. 256, 115 Ct. Cl. 838 (1950). Applying this principle, our precedents hold that courts should order arbitration of a dispute only where the court is satisfied that neither the formation of the parties' arbitration agreement nor (absent a valid provision specifically committing such disputes to an arbitrator) its enforceability or applicability to the dispute is in issue. Ibid. Where a party contests  either or both matters, “the court” must resolve the disagreement. Ibid.

Local nonetheless interprets some of our opinions to depart from this framework and to require arbitration of certain disputes, particularly labor disputes, based on policy grounds even where evidence of the parties' agreement to arbitrate the dispute in question is lacking. See Brief for Respondent Local, p. 16 (citing cases emphasizing the policy favoring arbitration generally and the “impressive policy considerations favoring arbitration” in LMRA cases (internal quotation marks omitted)). That is not a fair reading of the opinions, all of which compelled arbitration of a dispute only after the Court was persuaded that the parties' arbitration agreement was validly formed and that it covered the dispute in question and was legally enforceable. See, e.g., First Options, supra, at 944-945, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985. That Buckeye and some of our cases applying a presumption of arbitrability to certain disputes do not discuss each of these requirements merely reflects the fact that in those cases some of the requirements were so obviously satisfied that no discussion was needed.

In Buckeye, the formation of the parties' arbitration agreement was not at issue because the parties agreed that they had “concluded” an agreement to arbitrate and memorialized it as an arbitration clause in their loan contract. 546 U.S., at 444, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038. The arbitration clause's scope was also not at issue, because the provision expressly applied to “ '[a]ny claim, dispute, or controversy . . . arising from or relating to . . . the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Arbitration Provision or the entire Agreement.' Id., at 442, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038. The parties resisting arbitration (customers who agreed to the broad arbitration clause as a condition of using Buckeye's loan service) claimed only that a usurious interest provision in the loan agreement invalidated the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, and thus precluded the Court from relying on the clause as evidence of the parties' consent to arbitrate  matters within its scope. See id., at 443, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038. In rejecting this argument, we simply applied the requirement in § 2 of the FAA that courts treat an arbitration clause as severable from the contract in which it appears and enforce it according to its terms unless the party resisting arbitration specifically challenges the enforceability of the arbitration clause itself, see id., at 443-445, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (citing 9 U.S.C. § 2; Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 4-5, 104 S. Ct. 852, 79 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984); Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 402-404, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967)), or claims that the agreement to arbitrate was “[n]ever concluded,” 546 U.S., at 444, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038; see also Rent-A-Center, ante, at ___ - ___, and n. 2, 561 U.S. 63, 130 S. Ct. 2772, 177 L. Ed. 2d 403.

Our cases invoking the federal “policy favoring arbitration” of commercial and labor disputes apply the same framework. They recognize that,  except where “the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,” AT&T Technologies, 475 U.S., at 649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648, it is “the court's duty to interpret the agreement and to determine whether the parties intended to arbitrate grievances concerning” a particular matter, id., at 651, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648. They then discharge this duty by: (1) applying the presumption of arbitrability only where a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand; and (2) adhering to the presumption and ordering arbitration only where the presumption is not rebutted. See id., at 651-652, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648; Prima Paint Corp., supra, at 396-398, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270; Gateway Coal Co. v. Mine Workers, 414 U.S. 368, 374-377, 94 S. Ct. 629, 38 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1974); Drake Bakeries Inc. v. Bakery Workers, 370 U.S. 254, 256-257, 82 S. Ct. 1346, 8 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1962); Atkinson v. Sinclair Refining Co., 370 U.S. 238, 241-242, 82 S. Ct. 1318, 8 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1962); Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 576, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 (1960).8That our labor arbitration precedents apply this rule is hardly surprising. As noted above, see n. 6, supra, the rule is the foundation for the arbitrability framework this Court announced in the Steelworkers Trilogy. Local's assertion that Warrior & Gulf suggests otherwise is misplaced. Although Warrior & Gulf contains language that might in isolation be misconstrued as establishing a presumption that labor disputes are arbitrable whenever they are not expressly excluded from an arbitration clause, 363 U.S., at 578-582, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409, the opinion elsewhere emphasizes that even in LMRA cases, “courts” must construe arbitration clauses because “a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.” Id., at 582, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 (applying this rule and finding the dispute at issue arbitrable only after determining that the parties' arbitration clause could be construed under standard principles of contract interpretation to cover it). Our use of the same rules in FAA cases is also unsurprising. The rules are suggested by the statute itself. Section 2 of the FAA requires courts to enforce valid and enforceable arbitration agreements according to their terms. And § 4 provides in pertinent part that where a party invokes the jurisdiction of a federal court over a matter that the court could adjudicate but for the presence of an arbitration clause, “[t]he court shall hear the parties” and “direc[t] the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement” except “[i]f the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue,” in which case “the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof.” 9 U.S.C. § 4.

 Local is thus wrong to suggest that the presumption of arbitrability we sometimes apply takes courts outside our settled framework for deciding arbitrability. The presumption simply assists in resolving arbitrability disputes within that framework. Confining the presumption to this role reflects its foundation in “the federal policy favoring arbitration.” As we have explained, this “policy” is merely an acknowledgment of the FAA's commitment to “overrule the judiciary's longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.” Volt, 489 U.S., at 478, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we have never held that this policy overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration “only those disputes . . . that the parties have agreed to submit.” First Options, 514 U.S., at 943, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985; see also Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 57, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995) (“[T]he FAA's proarbitration policy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting parties”); AT&T Technologies, 475 U.S., at 650-651, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (applying the same rule to the “presumption of arbitrability for labor disputes”). Nor have we held that courts may use policy considerations as a substitute for party agreement. See, e.g., id., at 648-651, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648; Volt, supra, at 478, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488.  We have applied the presumption favoring arbitration, in FAA and in labor cases, only where it reflects, and derives its legitimacy from, a judicial conclusion that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed and (absent a provision clearly and validly committing such issues to an arbitrator) is legally enforceable and best construed to encompass the dispute. See First Options, supra, at 944-945, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (citing Mitsubishi, 473 U.S., at 626, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444); Howsam, 537 U.S., at 83-84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491; AT&T Technologies, supra, at 650, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (citing Warrior & Gulf, supra, at 582-583, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409); Drake Bakeries, supra, at 259-260, 82 S. Ct. 1346, 8 L. Ed. 2d 474. This simple framework compels reversal of the Court of Appeals' judgment because it requires judicial resolution of two questions central to Local's arbitration demand: when the CBA was formed, and whether its arbitration clause covers the matters Local wishes to arbitrate.

B 

We begin by addressing the grounds on which the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's decision to decide the parties' ratification-date dispute, which the parties characterize as a formation dispute because a union vote ratifying the CBA's terms was necessary to form the contract. See App. 351.9The parties' dispute about the CBA's ratification date presents a formation question in the sense above, and is therefore not on all fours with, for example, the formation disputes we referenced in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 444, n.1, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006), which concerned whether, not when, an agreement to arbitrate was “concluded.” That said, the manner in which the CBA's ratification date relates to Local's arbitration demand makes the ratification-date dispute in this case one that requires judicial resolution. See infra, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 582-585. For purposes of determining arbitrability, when a contract is formed can be as critical as whether it was formed. That is the case where, as here, the date on which an agreement was ratified determines the date the agreement was formed, and thus determines whether the agreement's provisions were enforceable during the period relevant to the parties' dispute.10Our conclusions about the significance of the CBA's ratification date to the specific arbitrability question before us do not disturb the general rule that parties may agree to arbitrate past disputes or future disputes based on past events.

This formation date question requires judicial resolution here because it relates to Local's arbitration demand in such a way that the District Court was required to decide the CBA's ratification date in order to determine whether the parties consented to arbitrate the matters covered by the demand.11In reaching this conclusion we need not, and do not, decide whether every dispute over a CBA's ratification date would require judicial resolution. We recognize that ratification disputes in labor cases may often qualify as “formation disputes” for contract law purposes because contract law defines formation as acceptance of an offer on specified terms, and in many labor cases ratification of a CBA is necessary to satisfy this formation requirement. See App. 349-351. But it is not the mere labeling of a dispute for contract law purposes that determines whether an issue is arbitrable. The test for arbitrability remains whether the parties consented to arbitrate the dispute in question. The parties agree that the CBA's arbitration clause pertains only to disputes that “arise under” the agreement. Accordingly, to hold the parties' ratification-date dispute arbitrable, the Court of Appeals had to decide whether that dispute could be characterized as “arising under” the CBA. In answering this question in the affirmative, both Local and the Court of Appeals tied the arbitrability of the ratification-date issue--which Local raised as a defense to Granite Rock's strike claims--to the arbitrability of the strike claims themselves. See id., at 347. They did so because the CBA's arbitration clause, which pertains only to disputes “arising under” the CBA and thus presupposes the CBA's existence, would seem plainly to cover a dispute that “arises under” a specific substantive provision of the CBA, but does not so obviously cover disputes about the CBA's own formation. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals relied upon the ratification dispute's relationship to Granite Rock's claim that Local breached the CBA's no-strike clause (a claim the Court of Appeals viewed as clearly “arising under” the CBA) to conclude that “the arbitration clause is certainly 'susceptible of an interpretation' that covers” Local's formation-date defense. 546 F.3d at 1177, n. 4.

The Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that this theory of the ratification dispute's arbitrability fails if the CBA was not formed at the time the unions engaged in the acts that gave rise to Granite Rock's strike claims. The unions began their strike on July 6, 2004, and Granite Rock filed its suit on July 9. If, as Local asserts, the CBA containing the parties' arbitration clause was not ratified, and thus not formed, until August 22, there was no CBA for the July no-strike dispute to “arise under,” and thus no valid basis for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Granite Rock's July 9 claims arose under the CBA and were thus arbitrable along with, by extension, Local's formation date defense to those claims.12This analysis pertains only to the Court of Appeals' decision, which did not engage the 11th-hour retroactivity argument Local raised in its merits brief in this Court, and that we address below. See ibid. For the foregoing reasons, resolution of the parties' dispute about whether the CBA was ratified in July or August was central to deciding Local's arbitration demand. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that it was not necessary for the District Court to determine the CBA's ratification date in order to decide whether the parties agreed to arbitrate Granite Rock's no-strike claim or the ratification-date dispute Local raised as a defense to that claim.

Local seeks to address this flaw in the Court of Appeals' decision by arguing that in December 2004 the parties executed  a document that rendered the CBA effective as of May 1, 2004 (the date the prior CBA expired), and that this effective-date language rendered the CBA's arbitration clause (but not its no-strike clause) applicable to the July strike period notwithstanding Local's view that the agreement was ratified in August (which ratification date Local continues to argue controls the period during which the no-strike clause applies). See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 26-27; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32, 37-39. The Court of Appeals did not rule on the merits of this claim (i.e., it did not decide whether the CBA's effective date language indeed renders some or all of the agreement's provisions retroactively applicable to May 2004), and we need not do so either. Even accepting Local's assertion that it raised this retroactivity argument in the District Court, see Brief for Respondent Local, p. 26,13This claim is questionable because Local's February 2005 references to the agreement “now in effect” are not obviously equivalent to the express retroactivity argument Local asserts in its merits brief in this Court. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 26-27. Local did not raise this argument in the Court of Appeals. Nor, more importantly, did Local's brief in opposition to Granite Rock's petition for certiorari raise the argument as an alternative ground on which this Court could or should affirm the Court of Appeals' judgment finding the ratification-date dispute arbitrable for the reasons discussed above. Accordingly, the argument is properly “deemed waived.” This Court's Rule 15.2; Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. ___, ___ , 555 U.S. 379, 129 S. Ct. 1058, 172 L. Ed. 2d 791 (2009).14Justice Sotomayor's conclusion that we should nonetheless excuse Local's waiver and consider the retroactivity argument, see post, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 590-591 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), is flawed. This Court's Rule 15.2reflects the fact that our adversarial system assigns both sides responsibility for framing the issues in a case. The importance of enforcing the Rule is evident in cases where, as here, excusing a party's noncompliance with it would require this Court to decide, in the first instance, a question whose resolution could affect this and other cases in a manner that the district court and court of appeals did not have an opportunity to consider, and that the parties' arguments before this Court may not fully address.

 C 

Although the foregoing is sufficient to reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment, there is an additional reason to do so: The dispute here, whether labeled a formation dispute or not, falls outside the scope of the parties' arbitration clause on grounds the presumption favoring arbitration cannot cure. Section 20 of the CBA provides in relevant part that “[a]ll disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in accordance with the [Grievance] procedure,” which includes arbitration. App. 434 (emphasis added); see also id., at 434-437. The parties' ratification-date dispute cannot properly be characterized as falling within the (relatively narrow, cf., e.g., Drake Bakeries Inc., 370 U.S., at 256-257, 82 S. Ct. 1346, 8 L. Ed. 2d 474) scope of this provision for at least two reasons. First, we do not think the question whether the CBA was validly ratified on July 2, 2004--a question that concerns the CBA's very existence--can fairly be said to “arise under” the CBA. Second, even if the “arising under” language could in isolation be construed to cover this dispute, Section 20's remaining provisions all but foreclose such a reading by describing that section's arbitration requirement as applicable to labor disagreements that are addressed in the CBA and are subject to its requirement of mandatory mediation. See App. 434-437 (requiring arbitration of disputes “arising under” the CBA, but only after the union and employer have exhausted mandatory mediation, and limiting any arbitration decision under this provision to those “within the scope and terms of this agreement and . . . specifically limited to the matter submitted”).

The Court of Appeals' contrary conclusion does not find support in the text of § 20. The Court of Appeals' only effort to grapple with that text misses the point because it focuses on whether Granite Rock's claim to enforce the CBA's no-strike provisions could be characterized as “arising under” the agreement. See 546 F.3d at 1177, n. 4. Even assuming that claim can be characterized as “arising under” the CBA, it is not the issue here. The issue is whether the formation-date defense that Local raised in response to Granite Rock's no-strike suit can be characterized as “arising under” the CBA. It cannot for the reasons we have explained, namely, the CBA provision requiring arbitration of disputes “arising under” the CBA is not fairly read to include a dispute about when the CBA came into existence. The Court of Appeals erred in failing to address this question and holding instead that the arbitration clause is “susceptible of an interpretation” that covers Local's formation-date defense to Granite Rock's suit “[b]ecause Granite Rock is suing 'under' the alleged new CBA” and “[a]rbitration clauses are to be construed very broadly.” Ibid.; see also id., at 1178.

D 

Local's remaining argument in support of the Court of Appeals' judgment is similarly unavailing. Local reiterates the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Granite Rock “implicitly” consented to arbitration when it sued to enforce the CBA's no-strike and arbitrable grievance provisions. See Brief for Respondent Local, pp. 17-18. We do not agree that by seeking an injunction against the strike so the parties could arbitrate the labor grievance that gave rise to it, Granite Rock also consented to arbitrate the ratification- (formation) date dispute we address above. See 546 F.3d at 1178. It is of course true that when Granite Rock sought that injunction it viewed the CBA (and all of its provisions) as enforceable. But Granite Rock's decision to sue for compliance with the CBA's grievance procedures on strike-related matters does not establish an agreement, “implicit” or otherwise, to arbitrate an issue (the CBA's formation date) that Granite Rock did not raise, and that Granite Rock has always (and rightly, see Part II-C, supra) characterized as beyond the scope of  the CBA's arbitration clause. The mere fact that Local raised the formation date dispute as a defense to Granite Rock's suit does not make that dispute attributable to Granite Rock in the waiver or estoppel sense the Court of Appeals suggested, see 546 F.3d at 1178, much less establish that Granite Rock agreed to arbitrate it by suing to enforce the CBA as to other matters. Accordingly, we hold that the parties' dispute over the CBA's formation date was for the District Court, not an arbitrator, to resolve, and remand for proceedings consistent with that conclusion.

III 

We turn now to the claims available on remand. The parties agree that Granite Rock can bring a breach-of-contract claim under LMRA § 301(a) against Local as a CBA signatory, and against IBT as Local's agent or alter ego. See Brief for Respondent IBT 10-13; Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13 and n. 11.15Although the parties concede the general availability of such a claim against IBT, they dispute whether Granite Rock abandoned its agency or alter ego allegations in the course of this litigation. Compare Brief for Respondent IBT, p. 10 with Reply Brief for Petitioner 12-13, n. 11. Granite Rock concedes that it has abandoned its claim that IBT acted as Local's undisclosed principal in orchestrating the ratification response to the July 2, 2004, CBA. See Plaintiff Granite Rock's Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant IBT's Motion To Dismiss in No. 5:04-cv-02767-JW (ND Cal., Aug. 7, 2006), Doc. 178, pp. 6, 8 (hereinafter Points and Authorities). But Granite Rock insists that it preserved its argument that Local served as IBT's agent or alter ego when Local denied ratification and engaged in unauthorized strike activity in July 2004. Nothing in the record before us unequivocally refutes this assertion. See App. 306, 311-315, 318; Points and Authorities 6, n. 3. Accordingly, nothing in this opinion forecloses the parties from litigating these claims on remand. The question is whether Granite Rock may also bring a federal tort claim under § 301(a) for IBT's alleged interference with the CBA.16IBT argues that we should dismiss this question as improvidently granted because Granite Rock abandoned its tortious interference claim when it declared its intention to seek only contractual (as opposed to punitive) damages on the claim. See Brief for Respondent IBT 16. We reject this argument, which confuses Granite Rock's decision to forgo the pursuit of punitive damages on its claim with a decision to abandon the claim itself. The two are not synonymous, and IBT cites no authority for the proposition that Granite Rock must allege more than economic damages to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Brief for Petitioner  32. The Court of Appeals joined virtually all other Circuits in holding that it would not recognize such a claim under § 301(a).

Granite Rock asks us to reject this position as inconsistent with federal labor law's goal of promoting industrial peace and economic stability through judicial enforcement of CBAs, as well as with our precedents holding that a federal common law of labor contracts is necessary to further this goal. See id., at 31; see also, e.g., Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U.S. 448, 451, 77 S. Ct. 912, 1 L. Ed. 2d 972 (1957). Explaining that IBT's conduct in this case undermines the very core of the bargaining relationship federal labor laws exist to protect, Granite Rock argues that a federal common-law tort remedy for IBT's conduct is necessary because other potential avenues for deterring and redressing such conduct are either unavailable or insufficient. See Brief for Petitioner 32-33; Reply Brief for Petitioner 19-20. On the unavailable side of the ledger Granite Rock lists state-law tort claims, some of which this Court has held § 301(a) pre-empts, as well as administrative (unfair labor practices) claims, which Granite Rock says the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) cannot entertain against international unions that (like IBT) are not part of the certified local bargaining unit they allegedly control. On the insufficient side of the ledger Granite Rock lists federal common-law breach-of-con-tract claims, which Granite Rock says are difficult to prove against non-CBA signatories like IBT because international unions structure their relationships with local unions in a way that makes agency or alter ego difficult to establish. Based on these assessments, Granite Rock suggests that this case presents us with the  choice of either recognizing the federal common-law tort claim Granite Rock seeks or sanctioning conduct inconsistent with federal labor statutes and our own precedents. See Brief for Petitioner 13-14.

We do not believe the choice is as stark as Granite Rock implies. It is of course true that we have construed “[S]ection 301 [to] authoriz[e] federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.” Lewis v. Benedict Coal Corp., 361 U.S. 459, 470, 80 S. Ct. 489, 4 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1960) (citing Lincoln Mills, supra). But we have also emphasized that in developing this common law we “did not envision any freewheeling inquiry into what the federal courts might find to be the most desirable rule.” Howard Johnson Co. v. Detroit Local Joint Executive Board, 417 U.S. 249, 255, 94 S. Ct. 2236, 41 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1974). The balance federal statutes strike between employer and union relations in the collective-bargaining arena is carefully calibrated, see, e.g., NLRB v. Drivers, Chauffeurs, Helpers, etc., 362 U.S. 274, 289-290, 80 S. Ct. 706, 4 L. Ed. 2d 710 (1960), and as the parties' briefs illustrate, creating a federal common-law tort cause of action would require a host of policy choices that could easily upset this balance, see Brief for Respondent IBT 42-44; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22-25. It is thus no surprise that virtually all Courts of Appeals have held that  federal courts' authority to “create a federal common law of collective bargaining agreements under section 301 should be confined to “a common law of contracts, not a source of independent rights, let alone tort rights; for section 301 is . . . a grant of jurisdiction only to enforce contracts.” Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co., 6 F.3d 1176, 1180 (CA7 1993). We see no reason for a different result here because it would be premature to recognize the federal common law tort Granite Rock requests in this case even assuming that § 301(a) authorizes us to do so.

In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that the question before us is a narrow one. It is not whether the conduct Granite Rock challenges is remediable, but whether we should augment the claims already available to Granite Rock  by creating a new federal common-law cause of action under § 301(a). That we decline to do so does not mean that we approve of IBT's alleged actions. Granite Rock describes a course of conduct that does indeed seem to strike at the heart of the collective-bargaining process federal labor laws were designed to protect. As the record in this case demonstrates, however, a new federal tort claim is not the only possible remedy for this conduct. Granite Rock's allegations have prompted favorable judgments not only from a federal jury, but also from the NLRB. In proceedings that predated those in which the District Court entered judgment for Granite Rock on the CBA's formation date,17Although the NLRB and federal jury reached different conclusions with respect to the CBA's ratification date, the discrepancy has little practical significance because the NLRB's remedial order against Local and IBT gives “retroactive effect to the terms of the [CBA of] July 2, 2004, as if ratified on that date.” In re Teamsters Local 287, 347 N. L. R. B. 339, 340 (2006). the NLRB concluded that a “complete agreement” was reached on July 2, and that Local and IBT violated federal labor laws by attempting to delay the CBA's ratification pending execution of a separate agreement favorable to IBT. See In re Teamsters Local 287, 347 N. L. R. B. 339, 340-341, and n. 1 (2006) (applying the remedial order on the 2004 conduct to both Local and IBT on the grounds that IBT did not disaffiliate from the AFL-CIO until July 25, 2005).

These proceedings, and the proceedings that remain to be conducted on remand, buttress our conclusion that Granite Rock's case for a new federal common-law cause of action is based on assumptions about the adequacy of other avenues of relief that are at least questionable because they have not been fully tested in this case and thus their efficacy is simply not before us to evaluate. Notably, Granite Rock (like IBT and the Court of Appeals) assumes that federal common law provides the only possible basis for the type of tort claim it wishes to pursue. See Brief for Respondent IBT 33-34;  Reply Brief for Petitioner 16. But Granite Rock did not litigate below, and thus does not present us with occasion to address, whether state law might provide a remedy. See, e.g., Steelworkers v. Rawson, 495 U.S. 362, 369-371, 110 S. Ct. 1904, 109 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1990); Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Div., AVCO Corp. v. Automobile Workers, 523 U.S. 653, 656, 658, 118 S. Ct. 1626, 140 L. Ed. 2d 863 (1998). Nor did Granite Rock fully explore the breach-of-contract and administrative causes of action it suggests are insufficient to remedy IBT's conduct. For example, far from establishing that an agency or alter ego claim against IBT would be unsuccessful, the record in this case suggests it might be easier to prove than usual if, as the NLRB's decision observes, IBT and Local were affiliated in 2004 in a way relevant to Granite Rock's claims. See In re Teamsters Local 287, supra, at 340, n. 6. Similarly, neither party has established that the NLRB itself could not issue additional relief against IBT. IBT's amicus argues that the “overlap between Granite Rock's § 301 claim against the IBT and the NLRB General Counsel's unfair labor practice complaint against Local 287 brings into play the National Labor Relations Act rule that an international union commits an unfair labor practice by causing its affiliated local unions to 'impose extraneous non-bargaining unit considerations into the collective bargaining process.' ” Brief for American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations 30-31 (quoting Paperworkers Local 620, 309 N. L. R. B. 44, 44 (1992)). The fact that at least one Court of Appeals has recognized the viability of such a claim, see Kobell v. United Paperworkers Int'l Union, 965 F.2d 1401, 1407-1409(CA6 1992), further persuades us that Granite Rock's arguments do not justify recognition of a new federal tort claim under § 301(a).

* * * 

We reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment on the arbitrability of the parties' formation-date dispute, affirm its judgment dismissing Granite Rock's claims against IBT to the  extent those claims depend on the creation of a new federal common-law tort cause of action under § 301(a), and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

We decide whether § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides a cause of action to foreign plaintiffs suing  foreign and American defendants for misconduct in connection with securities traded on foreign exchanges.

I 

Respondent National Australia Bank Limited (National) was, during the relevant time, the largest bank in Australia. Its Ordinary Shares--what in America would be called “common stock”--are traded on the Australian Stock Exchange Limited and on other foreign securities exchanges, but not on any exchange in the United States. There are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, however, National's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), which represent the right to receive a specified number of National's Ordinary Shares. 547 F.3d 167, 168, and n. 1 (CA2 2008).

The complaint alleges the following facts, which we accept as true. In February 1998, National bought respondent HomeSide Lending, Inc., a mortgage servicing company headquartered in Florida. HomeSide's business was to receive fees for servicing mortgages (essentially the administrative tasks associated with collecting mortgage payments, see J. Rosenberg, Dictionary of Banking and Financial Services 600 (2d ed. 1985)). The rights to receive those fees, so-called mortgage-servicing rights, can provide a valuable income stream. See 2 The New Palgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 817 (P. Newman, M. Milgate, & J. Eatwell eds. 1992). How valuable each of the rights is depends, in part, on the likelihood that the mortgage to which it applies will be fully repaid before it is due, terminating the need for servicing. HomeSide calculated the present value of its mortgage-servicing rights by using valuation models designed to take this likelihood into account. It recorded the value of its assets, and the numbers appeared in National's financial statements.

From 1998 until 2001, National's annual reports and other public documents touted the success of HomeSide's business, and respondents Frank Cicutto (National's managing director  and chief executive officer), Kevin Race (HomeSide's chief operating officer), and Hugh Harris (HomeSide's chief executive officer) did the same in public statements. But on July 5, 2001, National announced that it was writing down the value of HomeSide's assets by $450 million; and then again on September 3, by another $1.75 billion. The prices of both Ordinary Shares and ADRs slumped. After downplaying the July writedown, National explained the September writedown as the result of a failure to anticipate the lowering of prevailing interest rates (lower interest rates lead to more refinancings, i.e., more early repayments of mortgages), other mistaken assumptions in the financial models, and the loss of goodwill. According to the complaint, however, HomeSide, Race, Harris, and another HomeSide senior executive who is also a respondent here had manipulated HomeSide's financial models to make the rates of early repayment unrealistically low in order to cause the mortgage-servicing rights to appear more valuable than they really were. The complaint also alleges that National and Cicutto were aware of this deception by July 2000, but did nothing about it.

As relevant here, petitioners Russell Leslie Owen and Brian and Geraldine Silverlock, all Australians, purchased National's Ordinary Shares in 2000 and 2001, before the writedowns.1Robert Morrison, an American investor in National's ADRs, also brought suit, but his claims were dismissed by the District Court because he failed to allege damages. In re National Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94162, 2006 WL 3844465, *9 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). Petitioners did not appeal that decision, 547 F.3d 167, 170, n. 3 (CA2 2008) (case below), and it is not before us. Inexplicably, Morrison continued to be listed as a petitioner in the Court of Appeals and here. They sued National, HomeSide, Cicutto, and the three HomeSide executives in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for alleged violations of § 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act  of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR § 240.10b-5 (2009), promulgated pursuant to § 10(b).2The relevant text of § 10(b) and SEC Rule 10b-5 are set forth later in this opinion. Section 20(a), 48 Stat. 881, provides:“Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable, unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.”Liability under § 20(a) is obviously derivative of liability under some other provision of the Exchange Act; § 10(b) is the only basis petitioners asserted. They sought to represent a class of foreign purchasers of National's Ordinary Shares during a specified period up to the September writedown. 547 F.3d, at 169.

Respondents moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The District Court granted the motion on the former ground, finding no jurisdiction because the acts in this country were, “at most, a link in the chain of an alleged overall securities fraud scheme that culminated abroad.” In re National Australia Bank Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 6537 (BSJ), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94162, 2006 WL 3844465, *8 (SDNY, Oct. 25, 2006). The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed on similar grounds. The acts performed in the United States did not “compris[e] the heart of the alleged fraud.” 547 F.3d, at 175-176. We granted certiorari, 558 U.S. 1047, 130 S. Ct. 783, 175 L. Ed. 2d 513 (2009).

II 

Before addressing the question presented, we must correct a threshold error in the Second Circuit's analysis. It considered the extraterritorial reach of § 10(b) to raise a question of subject-matter jurisdiction, wherefore it affirmed the District  Court's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1). See 547 F.3d, at 177. In this regard it was following Circuit precedent, see Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 200, 208, modified on other grounds en banc, 405 F.2d 215 (1968). The Second Circuit is hardly alone in taking this position, see, e.g.,In re CP Ships Ltd. Securities Litigation, 578 F.3d 1306, 1313 (CA11 2009); Continental Grain (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Pacific Oilseeds, Inc., 592 F.2d 409, 421 (CA8 1979).

But  to ask what conduct § 10(b) reaches is to ask what conduct § 10(b) prohibits, which is a merits question. Subject-matter jurisdiction, by contrast, “refers to a tribunal's ' “power to hear a case.” ' ” Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment, Central Region, 558 U.S. 67,81, 130 S. Ct. 584, 175 L. Ed. 2d 428, 443 (2009) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006), in turn quoting United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630, 122 S. Ct. 1781, 152 L. Ed. 2d 860 (2002)). It presents an issue quite separate from the question whether the allegations the plaintiff makes entitle him to relief. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946). The District Court here had jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. § 78aa3Section 78aa provides: “The district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction of violations of [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder, and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by [the Exchange Act] or the rules and regulations thereunder.” to adjudicate the question whether § 10(b) applies to National's conduct.

In view of this error, which the parties do not dispute, petitioners ask us to remand. We think that unnecessary. Since nothing in the analysis of the courts below turned on the mistake, a remand would only require a new Rule 12(b)(6) label for the same Rule 12(b)(1) conclusion. As we have done before in situations like this, see, e.g.,Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 359, 381-384, 79 S. Ct. 468, 3 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1959), we proceed to address whether petitioners' allegations state a claim.

 III

A 

 It is a “longstanding principle of American law 'that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.' EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1991)(Aramco) (quoting Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285, 69 S. Ct. 575, 93 L. Ed. 680 (1949)). This principle represents a canon of construction, or a presumption about a statute's meaning, rather than a limit upon Congress's power to legislate, see Blackmer v. United States, 284 U.S. 421, 437, 52 S. Ct. 252, 76 L. Ed. 375 (1932). It rests on the perception that Congress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic, not foreign matters. Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. 197, 204, n. 5, 113 S. Ct. 1178, 122 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1993). Thus, “unless there is the affirmative intention of the Congress clearly expressed” to give a statute extraterritorial effect, “we must presume it is primarily concerned with domestic conditions.” Aramco, supra, at 248, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (internal quotation marks omitted). The canon or presumption applies regardless of whether there is a risk of conflict between the American statute and a foreign law, see Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc., 509 U.S. 155, 173-174, 113 S. Ct. 2549, 125 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1993). When a statute gives no clear indication of an extraterritorial application, it has none.

Despite this principle of interpretation, long and often recited in our opinions, the Second Circuit believed that, because the Exchange Act is silent as to the extraterritorial application of § 10(b), it was left to the court to “discern” whether Congress would have wanted the statute to apply. See 547 F.3d, at 170 (internal quotation marks omitted). This disregard of the presumption against extraterritoriality did not originate with the Court of Appeals panel in this case. It has been repeated over many decades by various Courts of Appeals in determining the application of the Exchange Act, and § 10(b) in particular, to fraudulent schemes that involve conduct and effects abroad. That has produced  a collection of tests for divining what Congress would  have wanted, complex in formulation and unpredictable in application.

As of 1967, District Courts at least in the Southern District of New York had consistently concluded that, by reason of the presumption against extraterritoriality, § 10(b) did not apply when the stock transactions underlying the violation occurred abroad. See Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 268 F. Supp. 385, 392 (1967)(citing Ferraioli v. Cantor, CCH Fed. Sec. L. Rep. P91615 (SDNY 1965) and Kook v. Crang, 182 F. Supp. 388, 390 (SDNY 1960)). Schoenbaum involved the sale in Canada of the treasury shares of a Canadian corporation whose publicly traded shares (but not, of course, its treasury shares) were listed on both the American Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Invoking the presumption against extraterritoriality, the court held that § 10(b) was inapplicable (though it incorrectly viewed the defect as jurisdictional). 268 F. Supp., at 391-392, 393-394. The decision in Schoenbaum was reversed, however, by a Second Circuit opinion which held that “neither the usual presumption against extraterritorial application of legislation nor the specific language of [§]30(b) show Congressional intent to preclude application of the Exchange Act to transactions regarding stocks traded in the United States which are effected outside the United States . . . .” Schoenbaum, 405 F.2d, at 206. It sufficed to apply § 10(b) that, although the transactions in treasury shares took place in Canada, they affected the value of the common shares publicly traded in the United States. See id., at 208-209. Application of § 10(b), the Second Circuit found, was “necessary to protect American investors,” id., at 206.

The Second Circuit took another step with Leasco Data Processing Equip. Corp. v. Maxwell, 468 F.2d 1326 (1972), which involved an American company that had been fraudulently induced to buy securities in England. There, unlike in Schoenbaum, some of the deceptive conduct had occurred  in the United States but the corporation whose securities were traded (abroad) was not listed on any domestic exchange. Leasco said that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies only to matters over which the United States would not have prescriptive jurisdiction, 468 F.2d, at 1334. Congress had prescriptive jurisdiction to regulate the deceptive conduct in this country, the language of the Act could be read to cover that conduct, and the court concluded that “if Congress had thought about the point,” it would have wanted § 10(b) to apply. Id., at 1334-1337.

With Schoenbaumand Leascoon the books, the Second Circuit had excised the presumption against extraterritoriality from the jurisprudence of § 10(b) and replaced it with the inquiry whether it would be reasonable (and hence what Congress would have wanted) to apply the statute to a given situation. As long as there was prescriptive jurisdiction to regulate, the Second Circuit explained, whether to apply § 10(b) even to “predominantly foreign” transactions became a matter of whether a court thought Congress “wished the precious resources of United States courts and law enforcement agencies to be devoted to them rather than leave the problem to foreign countries.” Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F.2d 974, 985 (1975); see also IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F.2d 1001, 1017-1018 (CA2 1975).

The Second Circuit had thus established that application of § 10(b) could be premised upon either some effect on American securities markets or investors (Schoenbaum) or significant conduct in the United States(Leasco).It later formalized these two applications into (1) an “effects test,” “whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or upon United States citizens,” and (2) a “conduct test,” “whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the United States.” SEC v. Berger, 322 F.3d 187, 192-193 (CA2 2003). These became the north star of the Second Circuit's § 10(b) jurisprudence, pointing the way to what Congress would have wished. Indeed, the Second Circuit declined to keep its two tests distinct on the ground that “an admixture or combination of the two often gives a better picture of whether there is sufficient United States involvement to justify the exercise of jurisdiction by an American court.” Itoba Ltd. v. Lep Group PLC, 54 F.3d 118, 122 (1995). The Second Circuit never put forward a textual or even extratextual basis for these tests. As early as Bersch, it confessed that “if we were asked to point to language in the statutes, or even in the legislative history, that compelled these conclusions, we would be unable to respond,” 519 F.2d, at 993.

As they developed, these tests were not easy to administer. The conduct test was held to apply differently depending on whether the harmed investors were Americans or foreigners: When the alleged damages consisted of losses to American investors abroad, it was enough that acts “of material importance” performed in the United States “significantly contributed” to that result; whereas those acts must have “directly caused” the result when losses to foreigners abroad were at issue. SeeBersch, 519 F.2d, at 993. And “merely preparatory activities in the United States” did not suffice “to trigger application of the securities laws for injury to foreigners located abroad.” Id., at 992. This required the court to distinguish between mere preparation and using the United States as a “base” for fraudulent activities in other countries. Vencap, supra, at 1017-1018. But merely satisfying the conduct test was sometimes insufficient without “ 'some additional factor tipping the scales' ” in favor of the application of American law. Interbrew v. Edperbrascan Corp., 23 F. Supp. 2d 425, 432 (SDNY 1998) (quoting Europe & Overseas Commodity Traders, S. A. v. Banque Paribas London, 147 F.3d 118, 129 (CA2 1998)). District Courts have noted the difficulty of applying such vague formulations. See, e.g.,In re Alstom SA, 406 F. Supp. 2d 346, 366-385 (SDNY 2005). There is no more damning indictment of the “conduct” and “effects” tests than the Second Circuit's own declaration that “the presence or absence of any single factor which was considered significant in other cases . . . is not necessarily dispositive in future cases.” IIT v. Cornfeld, 619 F.2d 909, 918 (1980) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Other Circuits embraced the Second Circuit's approach, though not its precise application. Like the Second Circuit, they described their decisions regarding the extraterritorial application of § 10(b) as essentially resolving matters of policy. See, e.g.,SEC v. Kasser, 548 F.2d 109, 116 (CA3 1977); Continental Grain, 592 F.2d, at 421-422; Grunenthal GmbH v. Hotz, 712 F.2d 421, 424-425 (CA9 1983); Kauthar SDN BHD v. Sternberg, 149 F.3d 659, 667 (CA7 1998). While applying the same fundamental methodology of balancing interests and arriving at what seemed the best policy, they produced a proliferation of vaguely related variations on the “conduct” and “effects” tests. As described in a leading Seventh Circuit opinion: “Although the circuits . . . seem to agree that there are some transnational situations to which the antifraud provisions of the securities laws are applicable, agreement appears to end at that point.”4The principal concurrence (see post, p. ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 558 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (hereinafter concurrence)) disputes this characterization, launching into a Homeric simile which takes as its point of departure (and mistakes for praise rather than condemnation) then-Justice Rehnquist's statement in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723, 737, 95 S. Ct. 1917, 44 L. Ed. 2d 539 (1975), that “[w]hen we deal with private actions under Rule 10b-5, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.” Post, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 560. The concurrence seemingly believes that the Courts of Appeals have carefully trimmed and sculpted this “judicial oak” into a cohesive canopy, under the watchful eye of Judge Henry Friendly, the “master arborist,” ibid. See post, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 559. Even if one thinks that the “conduct” and “effects” tests are numbered among Judge Friendly's many fine contributions to the law, his successors, though perhaps under the impression that they nurture the same mighty oak, are in reality tending each its own botanically distinct tree. It is telling that the concurrence never attempts its own synthesis of the various balancing tests the Circuits have adopted.Id., at 665. See also id., at 665-667 (describing the approaches of the various Circuits and adopting yet another variation).

At least one Court of Appeals has criticized this line of cases and the interpretive assumption that underlies it. In Zoelsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 824 F.2d 27, 32, 262 U.S. App. D.C. 300 (1987) (Bork, J.), the District of Columbia Circuit observed that rather than courts' “divining what 'Congress would have wished' if it had addressed the problem[, a] more natural inquiry might be what jurisdiction Congress in fact thought about and conferred.” Although tempted to apply the presumption against extraterritoriality and be done with it, see id., at 31-32, that court deferred to the Second Circuit because of its “preeminence in the field of securities law,” id., at 32. See also Robinson v. TCI/US West Communications Inc., 117 F.3d 900, 906-907 (CA5 1997) (expressing agreement with Zoelsch's criticism of the emphasis on policy considerations in some of the cases).

Commentators have criticized the unpredictable and inconsistent application of § 10(b) to transnational cases. See, e.g., Choi & Silberman, Transnational Litigation and Global Securities Class-Action Lawsuits, 2009 Wis. L. Rev. 465, 467-468; Chang, Multinational Enforcement of U. S. Securities Laws: The Need for the Clear and Restrained Scope of Extraterritorial Subject-Matter Jurisdiction, 9 Fordham J. Corp. & Fin. L. 89, 106-108, 115-116 (2004); Langevoort, Schoenbaum Revisited: Limiting the Scope of Antifraud Protection in an Internationalized Securities Marketplace, 55 Law & Contemp. Prob. 241, 244-248 (1992). Some have challenged the premise underlying the Courts of Appeals' approach, namely, that Congress did not consider the extraterritorial application of § 10(b) (thereby leaving it open to the courts, supposedly, to determine what Congress would have wanted). See, e.g., Sachs, The International Reach of Rule 10b-5: The Myth of Congressional Silence, 28 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 677 (1990) (arguing that Congress considered, but rejected, applying the Exchange Act to transactions abroad). Others,  more fundamentally, have noted that using congressional silence as a justification for [judge-made rules] violates the traditional principle that silence means no extraterritorial application. See, e.g., Note, Let There Be Fraud (Abroad): A Proposal for a New U. S. Jurisprudence with Regard to the Extraterritorial Application of the Anti-Fraud Provisions of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts, 28 Law & Pol'y Int'l Bus. 477, 492-493 (1997).

The criticisms seem to us justified.  The results of judicial-speculation-made-law--[divining what Congress would have wanted] if it had thought of the situation before the court--demonstrate the wisdom of the presumption against extraterritoriality. Rather than guess anew in each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which Congress can legislate with predictable effects.5The concurrence urges us to cast aside our inhibitions and join in the judicial lawmaking, because “[t]his entire area of law is replete with judge-made rules,” post, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 560. It is doubtless true that, because the implied private cause of action under § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is a thing of our own creation, we have also defined its contours. See, e.g., Blue Chip Stamps, supra.But  when it comes to “the scope of [the] conduct prohibited by [Rule 10b-5] § 10(b), the text of the statute controls our decision.” Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 173, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994). It is only with respect to the additional “elements of the 10b-5 private liability scheme? that we “have had 'to infer how the 1934 Congress would have addressed the issue[s] had the 10b-5 action been included as an express provision in the 1934 Act.' ” Ibid. (quoting Musick, Peeler & Garrett v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 508 U.S. 286, 294, 113 S. Ct. 2085, 124 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1993)).

B 

Rule 10b-5, the regulation under which petitioners have brought suit,6Rule 10b-5 makes it unlawful: “for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,“(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,“(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or“(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.” 17 CFR § 240.10b-5 (2009).The Second Circuit considered petitioners' appeal to raise only a claim under Rule 10b-5(b), since it found their claims under subsections (a) and (c) to be forfeited. 547 F.3d, at 176, n. 7. We do likewise. was promulgated under § 10(b), and “does not  extend beyond conduct encompassed by § 10(b)'s prohibition.” United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 651, 117 S. Ct. 2199, 138 L. Ed. 2d 724 (1997). Therefore, if § 10(b) is not extraterritorial, neither is Rule 10b-5.

 On its face, § 10(b) contains nothing to suggest it applies abroad:

“It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange . . . . . [t]o use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the [Securities and Exchange] Commission may prescribe . . . .” 15 U.S.C. 78j(b).

 Petitioners and the Solicitor General contend, however, that three things indicate that § 10(b) or the Exchange Act in general has at least some extraterritorial application.

First, they point to  the definition of “interstate commerce,” a term used in § 10(b), which includes “trade, commerce, transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and any State.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(17). But “we have repeatedly held that even statutes that contain  broad language in their definitions of 'commerce' that expressly refer to 'foreign commerce' do not apply abroad.” Aramco, 499 U.S., at 251, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274; see id., at 251-252, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (discussing cases). The general reference to foreign commerce in the definition of ?interstate commerce” does not defeat the presumption against extraterritoriality.7This conclusion does not render meaningless the inclusion of “trade, commerce, transportation, or communication . . . between any foreign country and any State” in the definition of “interstate commerce.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(17). For example, an issuer based abroad, whose executives approve the publication in the United States of misleading information affecting the price of the issuer's securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange, probably will make use of some instrumentality of “communication . . . between [a] foreign country and [a] State.”

Petitioners and the Solicitor General next point out that Congress, in describing the purposes of the Exchange Act, observed that the “prices established and offered in such transactions are generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign countries.” 15 U.S.C. § 78b(2). The antecedent of “such transactions,” however, is found in the first sentence of the section, which declares that “transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are affected with a national public interest.” § 78b. Nothing suggests that this national public interest pertains to transactions conducted upon foreign exchanges and markets. The fleeting reference to the dissemination and quotation abroad of the prices of securities traded in domestic exchanges and markets cannot overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.

Finally, there is § 30(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd(b), which does mention the Act's extraterritorial application: “The provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall not apply to any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the  jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission “to prevent the . . . evasion of [the Act].” (The parties have pointed us to no regulation promulgated pursuant to § 30(b).) The Solicitor General argues that “[this] exemption would have no function if the Act did not apply in the first instance to securities transactions that occur abroad.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14.

We are not convinced. In the first place, it would be odd for Congress to indicate the extraterritorial application of the whole Exchange Act by means of a provision imposing a condition precedent to its application abroad. And if the whole Act applied abroad, why would the Commission's enabling regulations be limited to those preventing “evasion” of the Act, rather than all those preventing “violation”?  The provision seems to us directed at actions abroad that might  conceal a domestic violation, or might cause what would otherwise be a domestic violation to escape on a technicality. At most, the Solicitor General's proposed inference is possible; but  possible interpretations of statutory language do not override the presumption against extraterritoriality. See Aramco, supra, at 253, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274.

The Solicitor General also fails to account for § 30(a), which reads in relevant part as follows:

 “It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer . . . to make use of the mails or of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce for the purpose of effecting on an exchange not within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, any transaction in any security the issuer of which is a resident of, or is organized under the laws of, or has its principal place of business in, a place within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe . . . .” 15 U.S.C. § 78dd(a).

Subsection 30(a) contains what § 10(b) lacks: a clear statement of extraterritorial effect. Its explicit provision for a specific extraterritorial application would be quite superfluous if the rest of the Exchange Act already applied to transactions on foreign exchanges--and its limitation of that application to securities of domestic issuers would be inoperative. Even if that were not true, when a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit that provision to its terms. See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.S. 437, 455-456, 127 S. Ct. 1746, 167 L. Ed. 2d 737 (2007). No one claims that § 30(a) applies here.

The concurrence claims we have impermissibly narrowed the inquiry in evaluating whether a statute applies abroad, citing for that point the dissent in Aramco, see post, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 562. But  we do not say, as the concurrence seems to think, that the presumption against extraterritoriality is a “clear statement rule,” ibid., if by that is meant a requirement that a statute say “this law applies abroad.” Assuredly context can be consulted as well. But whatever sources of statutory meaning one consults to give “the most faithful reading” of the text, post, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 562, there is no clear indication of extraterritoriality here. The concurrence does not even try to refute that conclusion, but merely puts forward the same (at best) uncertain indications relied upon by petitioners and the Solicitor General. As the opinion forthe Court in Aramco (which we prefer to the dissent) shows, those uncertain indications do not suffice.8The concurrence notes that, post-Aramco, Congress provided explicitly for extraterritorial application of Title VII, the statute at issue in Aramco. Post, at ___, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 562. All this shows is that Congress knows how to give a statute explicit extraterritorial effect--and how to limit that effect to particular applications, which is what the cited amendment did. See Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 109, 105 Stat. 1077.

In short,  there is no affirmative indication in the Exchange Act that § 10(b) applies extraterritorially, and we therefore conclude that it does not.

 IV

A 

Petitioners argue that the conclusion that § 10(b) does not apply extraterritorially does not resolve this case. They contend that they seek no more than domestic application anyway, since Florida is where HomeSide and its senior executives engaged in the deceptive conduct of manipulating HomeSide's financial models; their complaint also alleged that Race and Hughes made misleading public statements there. This is less an answer to the presumption against extraterritorial application than it is an assertion--a quite valid assertion--that that presumption here (as often) is not self-evidently dispositive, but its application requires further analysis. For it is a rare case of prohibited extraterritorial application that lacks all contact with the territory of the United States. But the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven watchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case. The concurrence seems to imagine just such a timid sentinel, see post, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 562-563, but our cases are to the contrary. In Aramco, for example, the Title VII plaintiff had been hired in Houston, and was an American citizen. See 499 U.S., at 247, 111 S. St. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274. The Court concluded, however, that neither that territorial event nor that relationship was the “focus” of congressional concern, id., at 255, 111 S. St. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274, but rather domestic employment. See also Foley Bros., 336 U.S., at 283, 285-286, 69 S. Ct. 575, 93 L. Ed. 680.

Applying the same mode of analysis here, we think that  the focus of the Exchange Act is not upon the place where the deception originated, but upon purchases and sales of securities in the United States. Section 10(b) does not punish deceptive conduct, but only deceptive conduct “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered.” 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b). See SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 820, 122 S. Ct. 1899, 153 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002). Those purchase-and-sale transactions are the objects of the statute's solicitude. It is those transactions that the statute seeks to “regulate,” see Superintendent of Ins. of N. Y. v. Bankers Life & Casualty Co., 404 U.S. 6, 12, 92 S. Ct. 165, 30 L. Ed. 2d 128 (1971); it is parties or prospective parties to those transactions that the statute seeks to “protec[t],” id., at 10, 92 S. Ct. 165, 30 L. Ed. 2d 128. See also Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 195, 96 S. Ct. 1375, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1976). And it is in our view only transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other securities, to which § 10(b) applies.9The concurrence seems to think this test has little to do with our conclusion in Part III, supra, that § 10(b) does not apply extraterritorially. See post, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 564-565. That is not so. If § 10(b) did apply abroad, we would not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it would apply to all of them (barring some other limitation). Thus, although it is true, as we have said, that our threshold conclusion that § 10(b) has no extraterritorial effect does not resolve this case, it is a necessary first step in the analysis.The concurrence also makes the curious criticism that our evaluation of where a putative violation occurs is based on the text of § 10(b) rather than the doctrine in the Courts of Appeals. Post, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 559. Although it concedes that our test is textually plausible, post, at ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 559, it does not (and cannot) make the same claim for the Court-of-Appeals doctrine it endorses. That is enough to make our test the better one.

 The primacy of the domestic exchange is suggested by the very prologue of the Exchange Act, which sets forth as its object “[t]o provide for the regulation of securities exchanges . . . operating in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, to prevent inequitable and unfair practices on such exchanges . . . .” 48 Stat. 881. We know of no one who thought that the Act was intended to “regulat[e]” foreign securities exchanges--or indeed who even believed that under established principles of international law Congress had the power to do so. The Act's registration requirements apply only to securities listed on national securities exchanges. 15 U.S.C. § 78l(a).

 With regard to securities not registered on domestic exchanges, the exclusive focus on domestic purchases and sale10That is in our view the meaning which the presumption against extraterritorial application requires for the words “purchase or sale, of . . . any security not so registered” in § 10(b)'s phrase “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered ” (Emphasis added.) Even without the presumption against extraterritorial application, the only alternative to that reading makes nonsense of the phrase, causing it to cover all purchases and sales of registered securities, and all purchases and sales of nonregistered securities--a thought which, if intended, would surely have been expressed by the simpler phrase “all purchases and sales of securities.? is strongly confirmed by § 30(a) and (b), discussed earlier. The former extends the normal scope of the Exchange Act's prohibitions to acts effecting, in violation of rules prescribed by the Commission, a “transaction” in a United States security “on an exchange not within or subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” § 78dd(a). And the latter specifies that the Act does not apply to “any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless he does so in violation of regulations promulgated by the Commission “to prevent evasion [of the Act].” § 78dd(b). Under both provisions it is the foreign location of the transaction that establishes (or reflects the presumption of) the Act's inapplicability, absent regulations by the Commission.

 The same focus on domestic transactions is evident in the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 74, enacted by the same Congress as the Exchange Act, and forming part of the same comprehensive regulation of securities trading. See Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.S. 164, 170-171, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994). That legislation makes it unlawful to sell a security, through a prospectus or otherwise, making use of “any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails,” unless a registration statement is in effect.15 U.S.C. § 77e(a)(1). The Commission has interpreted that requirement “not to include . . . sales that occur outside the United States.” 17 CFR § 230.901 (2009).

Finally,  we reject the notion that the Exchange Act reaches conduct in this country affecting exchanges or transactions abroad for the same reason that Aramco rejected overseas application of Title VII to all domestically concluded employment contracts or all employment contracts with American employers: The probability of incompatibility with the applicable laws of other countries is so obvious that if Congress intended such foreign application “it would have addressed the subject of conflicts with foreign laws and procedures.” 499 U.S., at 256, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 . Like the United States, foreign countries regulate their domestic securities exchanges and securities transactions occurring within their territorial jurisdiction. And the regulation of other countries often differs from ours as to what constitutes fraud, what disclosures must be made, what damages are recoverable, what discovery is available in litigation, what individual actions may be joined in a single suit, what attorney's fees are recoverable, and many other matters. See, e.g., Brief for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 16-21. The Commonwealth of Australia, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the Republic of France have filed amicus briefs in this case. So have (separately or jointly) such international and foreign organizations as the International Chamber of Commerce, the Swiss Bankers Association, the Federation of German Industries, the French Business Confederation, the Institute of International Bankers, the European Banking Federation, the Australian Bankers' Association, and the Association Francaise des Entreprises Privees. They all complain of the interference with foreign securities regulation that application of § 10(b) abroad would produce, and urge the adoption of a clear test that will avoid that consequence. The transactional test we have adopted--whether the purchase or sale  is made in the United States, or involves a security listed on a domestic exchange--meets that requirement.

B 

The Solicitor General suggests a different test, which petitioners also endorse: “[A] transnational securities fraud violates [§] 10(b) when the fraud involves significant conduct in the United States that is material to the fraud's success.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16; see Brief for Petitioners 26. Neither the Solicitor General nor petitioners provide any textual support for this test. The Solicitor General sets forth a number of purposes such a test would serve: achieving a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry, ensuring honest securities markets and thereby promoting investor confidence, and preventing the United States from becoming a “Barbary Coast” for malefactors perpetrating frauds in foreign markets. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16-17. But it provides no textual support for the last of these purposes, or for the first two as applied to the foreign securities industry and securities markets abroad.  It is our function to give the statute the effect its language suggests, however modest that may be; not to extend it to admirable purposes it might be used to achieve.

If, moreover, one is to be attracted by the desirable consequences of the “significant and material conduct” test, one should also be repulsed by its adverse consequences. While there is no reason to believe that the United States has become the Barbary Coast for those perpetrating frauds on foreign securities markets, some fear that it has become the Shangri-La of class-action litigation for lawyers representing those allegedly cheated in foreign securities markets. See Brief for Infineon Technologies AG as Amicus Curiae 1-2, 22-25; Brief for European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. N. V. et al. as Amici Curiae 2-4; Brief for Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association et al. as Amici Curiae 10-16; Coffee, Securities Policeman to the World? The Cost  of Global Class Actions, N. Y. L. J. 5 (2008); S. Grant & D. Zilka, The Current Role of Foreign Investors in Federal Securities Class Actions, PLI Corporate Law and Practice Handbook Series, PLI Order No. 11072, pp. 15-16 (Sept.-Oct. 2007); Buxbaum, Multinational Class Actions Under Federal Securities Law: Managing Jurisdictional Conflict, 46 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 14, 38-41 (2007).

As case support for the “significant and material conduct” test, the Solicitor General relies primarily on Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U.S. 349, 125 S. Ct. 1766, 161 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2005).11Discussed in Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22-23. The Solicitor General also cites, without description, a number of antitrust cases to support the proposition that domestic conduct with consequences abroad can be covered even by a statute that does not apply extraterritorially: Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962); United States v. Sisal Sales Corp., 274 U.S. 268, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042 (1927); Thomsen v. Cayser, 243 U.S. 66, 37 S. Ct. 353, 61 L. Ed. 597 (1917); United States v. Pacific & Arctic R. & Nav. Co., 228 U.S. 87, 33 S. Ct. 443, 57 L. Ed. 742, 4 Alaska Fed. 87 (1913). These are no longer of relevance to the point (if they ever were), since Continental Ore overruled the holding of American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 357, 29 S. Ct. 511, 53 L. Ed. 826 (1909), that the antitrust laws do not apply extraterritorially. See W. S. Kirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp. Int'l,493 U.S. 400, 407-408, 110 S. Ct. 701, 107 L. Ed. 2d 816 (1990). Moreover, the pre-Continental Ore cases all involved conspiracies to restrain trade in the United States, see Sisal Sales, supra, at 274-276, 47 S. Ct. 592, 71 L. Ed. 1042; Thomsen, supra, at 88, 37 S. Ct. 353, 61 L. Ed. 597; Pacific & Arctic, supra, at 105-106, 33 S. Ct. 443, 57 L. Ed. 742, 4 Alaska Fed. 87And although a final case cited by the Solicitor General, Steele v. Bulova Watch Co., 344 U.S. 280, 287-288, 73 S. Ct. 252, 97 L. Ed. 319, 1953 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 424 (1952), might be read to permit application of a nonextraterritorial statute whenever conduct in the United States contributes to a violation abroad, we have since read it as interpreting the statute at issue--the Lanham Act--to have extraterritorial effect, EEOC v. Aramco, 499 U.S. 244, 252, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1991) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1127). In that case we concluded that the wire-fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. II), was violated by defendants who ordered liquor over the phone from a store in Maryland with the intent to smuggle it into Canada and deprive the Canadian Government of revenue. 544 U.S., at 353, 371, 125 S. Ct. 1766, 161 L. Ed. 2d 619. Section 1343 prohibits “any scheme or artifice to defraud,” fraud simpliciter,  without any requirement that it be “in connection with” any particular transaction or event. The Pasquantino Court said that the petitioners' “offense was complete the moment they executed the scheme inside the United States,” and that it was “[t]his domestic element of petitioners' conduct [that] the Government is punishing.” 544 U.S., at 371, 125 S. Ct. 1766, 161 L. Ed. 2d 619. Section 10(b), by contrast, punishes not all acts of deception, but only such acts “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered.” Not deception alone, but deception with respect to certain purchases or sales is necessary for a violation of the statute.

The Solicitor General points out that the “significant and material conduct” test is in accord with prevailing notions of international comity. If so, that proves that if the United States asserted prescriptive jurisdiction pursuant to the “significant and material conduct” test it would not violate customary international law; but it in no way tends to prove that that is what Congress has done.

Finally, the Solicitor General argues that the Commission has adopted an interpretation similar to  the “significant and material conduct” test, and that we should defer to that. In the two adjudications the Solicitor General cites, however, the Commission did not purport to be providing its own interpretation of the statute, but relied on decisions of federal courts--mainly Court of Appeals decisions that in turn relied on the Schoenbaum and Leasco decisions of the Second Circuit that we discussed earlier. See In re U.S. Securities Clearing Corp., 52 S. E. C. 92, 95, n. 14, 96, n. 16 (1994); In re Robert F. Lynch, 46 S.E.C. 5, 10 n. 15 (1975).  We need “accept only those agency interpretations that are reasonable in light of the principles of construction courts normally employ.” Aramco, 499 U.S., at 260, 111 S. Ct. 1227, 113 L. Ed. 2d 274 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Since the Commission's interpretations relied on cases we disapprove, which ignored or discarded the presumption against extraterritoriality, we owe them no deference.

* * * 

Section 10(b) reaches the use of a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance only in connection with the purchase or sale of a security listed on an American stock exchange, and the purchase or sale of any other security in the United States. This case involves no securities listed on a domestic exchange, and all aspects of the purchases complained of by those petitioners who still have live claims occurred outside the United States. Petitioners have therefore failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We affirm the dismissal of petitioners' complaint on this ground.

It is so ordered.

Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV-B.

Petitioner Billy Joe Magwood was sentenced to death for murdering a sheriff. After the Alabama courts denied relief on direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings, Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court, challenging both his conviction and his sentence. The District Court conditionally granted the writ as to the sentence, mandating that Magwood either be released or resentenced. The state trial court conducted a new sentencing hearing and again sentenced Magwood to death. Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court challenging this new sentence. The District Court once again conditionally granted the writ, finding constitutional defects in the new sentence. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding in relevant part that Magwood's challenge to his new death sentence was an unreviewable “second or successive” challenge under 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) because he could have mounted the same challenge to his original death sentence. We granted certiorari, and now reverse. Because Magwood's habeas application1 Although 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) refers to a habeas “application,” we use the word “petition” interchangeably with the word “application,” as we have in our prior cases. challenges a new judgment for the first time, it is not “second or successive” under § 2244(b).

I 

After a conviction for a drug offense, Magwood served several years in the Coffee County Jail in Elba, Alabama, under the watch of Sheriff C. F. “Neil” Grantham. During his incarceration, Magwood, who had a long history of mental illness, became convinced that Grantham had imprisoned him without cause, and vowed to get even upon his release. Magwood followed through on his threat. On the morning of March 1, 1979, shortly after his release, he parked outside the jail and awaited the sheriff's arrival. When Grantham exited his car, Magwood shot him and fled the scene.

Magwood was indicted by a grand jury for the murder of an on-duty sheriff, a capital offense under Ala. Code § 13-11-2(a)(5) (1975).2At the time of the murder, Ala. Code § 13-11-2(a) provided: “If the jury finds the defendant guilty, it shall fix the punishment at death when the defendant is charged by indictment with any of the following offenses and with aggravation, which must also be averred in the indictment . . . .” The offenses included “murder of any . . . sheriff . . . while . . . on duty or because of some official or job-related act.” § 13-11-2(a)(5). The same statute set forth a list of “aggravating circumstances,” § 13-11-6, but the trial court found that none existed in Magwood's case. He was tried in 1981. The prosecution asked the jury to find Magwood guilty of aggravated murder as charged in the indictment, and sought the death penalty. Magwood pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity; however, the jury found him guilty of capital murder under § 13-11-2(a)(5), and imposed the sentence of death based on the aggravation charged in the indictment. In accordance with Alabama law, the trial court reviewed the basis for the jury's decision. See §§ 13-11-3, 13-11-4. Although the court did not find the existence of any statutory “aggravating circumstance” under § 13-11-6, the court relied on Ex parte Kyzer, 399 So. 2d 330 (Ala. 1981), to find that murder of a sheriff while “on duty or because of some official or job-related act,” § 13-11-2(a)(5), is a capital felony that, by definition, involves aggravation sufficient for a death sentence.3As relevant here, Kyzer did away with the prior Alabama rule that an aggravating component of a capital felony could not double as an aggravating factor supporting a capital sentence. In Kyzer, the defendant had been sentenced to death for the intentional murder of “two or more human beings” under § 13-11-2(a)(10). 399 So. 2d, at 332. The crime of murder, so defined, was aggravated by its serial nature, just as Magwood's crime of murder, as defined under § 13-11-2(a)(5), was aggravated by the fact that he killed an on-duty sheriff because of the sheriff's job-related acts. In Kyzer, the Alabama Supreme Courtultimately remanded for a new trial but, in order to guide the lower court on remand, addressed whether the aggravation in the charged crime, see § 13-11-2(a)(10), was sufficient to impose a sentence of death even without a finding of any “aggravating circumstance” enumerated in § 13-11-6. Id., at 337. The court ruled that if the defendant was convicted under § 13-11-2(a)(10), “the jury and the trial judge at the sentencing hearing may find the aggravation averred in the indictment as the aggravating circumstance, even though the aggravation is not listed in § 13-11-6 as an aggravating circumstance.” Id., at 339 (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court found that Magwood's young age (27 at the time of the offense) and lack of significant criminal history qualified as mitigating factors, but found no mitigation related to Magwood's mental state. Weighing the aggravation against the two mitigating factors, the court approved the sentence of death. The Alabama courts affirmed. Magwood v. State, 426 So. 2d 918, 929 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982); Ex parte Magwood,426 So. 2d 929, 932 (Ala. 1983). We denied certiorari. Magwood v. Alabama, 462 U.S. 1124, 103 S. Ct. 3097, 103 S. Ct. 3098, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1355 (1983). After the Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date of July 22, 1983, Magwood filed a coram nobis petition and an application for a stay of execution. The trial court held a hearing on the petition and denied relief on July 18, 1983.4The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals subsequently affirmed the denial of Magwood's coram nobis petition, Magwood v. State,449 So. 2d 1267 (1984), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied Magwood's motion to file an out-of-time appeal from that decision, Ex parte Magwood, 453 So. 2d 1349 (1984).

Eight days before his scheduled execution, Magwood filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254, and the District Courtgranted a stay of execution. After briefing by the parties, the District Court upheld Magwood's conviction but vacated his sentence and conditionally granted the writ based on the trial court's failure to find statutory mitigating circumstances relating to Magwood's mental state.5See Ala. Code § 13-11-7 (“Mitigating circumstances shall be the following: . . . (2) The capital felony was committed while the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, . . . (6) The capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired”).Magwood v. Smith, 608 F. Supp. 218, 225-226, 229 (MD Ala. 1985). The Court of Appeals affirmed. Magwood v. Smith, 791 F.2d 1438, 1450 (CA11 1986).

In response to the conditional writ, the state trial court held a new sentencing proceeding in September 1986. This time, the judge found that Magwood's mental state, as well as his age and lack of criminal history, qualified as statutory mitigating circumstances. As before, the court found that Magwood's capital felony under § 13-11-2(a)(5) included sufficient aggravation to render him death eligible. In his proposed findings, Magwood's attorney agreed that Magwood's offense rendered him death eligible, but argued that a death sentence would be inappropriate in light of the mitigating factors. The trial court imposed a penalty of death, stating on the record that the new “judgment and sentence [were] the result of a complete and new assessment of all of the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law.” Sentencing Tr., R. Tab 1, p. R-25. The Alabama courts affirmed, Magwood v. State,548 So. 2d 512, 516 (Ala. Crim. App. 1988); Ex parte Magwood, 548 So. 2d 516, 516 (Ala. 1988), and this Court denied certiorari, Magwood v. Alabama, 493 U.S. 923, 110 S. Ct. 291, 107 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1989).

Magwood filed a petition for relief under Alabama's former Temporary Rule of Criminal Procedure 20 (1987) (now Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 32) (Rule 20 petition) claiming, inter alia, that his death sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by statute; that his death sentence violated the Fifth, Eighth, andFourteenth Amendments because it rested upon an unforeseeable interpretation of the capital sentencing statute; and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during resentencing. The trial court denied relief. It held that the statutory basis for Magwood's death sentence had been affirmed on direct appeal and could not be relitigated. The trial court also held that Magwood's attorney played no substantive role in the resentencing and had no obligation to dispute the aggravation, given that the District Court had required only that the trial court consider additional mitigating factors.

Magwood appealed the denial of his Rule 20 petition, arguing, inter alia, that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning that his offense could be punished by death, and that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing. See Record in Appeal No. 92-843 (Ala. Crim. App.), Tab 25, pp. 23-24, 53-61.

The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, citing its decision on direct appeal as to the propriety of the death sentence. Magwood v. State, 689 So. 2d 959, 965 (1996) (citing Kyzer,supra, and Jackson v. State, 501 So. 2d 542 (Ala. Crim. App. 1986)).6In Jackson v. State, 501 So. 2d, at 544 the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals held that Kyzer supported a death sentence for a defendant who was convicted for an offense committed before Kyzer was decided but was resentenced after that decision. The Alabama Supreme Court denied certiorari, 689 So. 2d, at 959, as did this Court, Magwood v. Alabama, 522 U.S. 836, 118 S. Ct. 108, 139 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1997).

In April 1997, Magwood sought leave to file a second or successive application for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his 1981 judgment of conviction. See § 2244(b)(3)(A) (requiring authorization from the Court of Appeals to file a second  or successive application). The Court of Appeals denied his request. In re Magwood,113 F.3d 1544 (CA11 1997). He simultaneously filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging his new death sentence, which the District Court conditionally granted. Magwood v. Culliver,481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1295 (MD Ala. 2007). In that petition, Magwood again argued that his sentence was unconstitutional because he did not have fair warning at the time of his offense that his conduct would be sufficient to warrant a death sentence under Alabama law, and that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance during the resentencing proceeding.

Before addressing the merits of Magwood's fair-warning claim, the District Courtsua sponte considered whether the application was barred as a “successive petition” under § 2244, and concluded that it was not. Id., at 1283-1284 (“[H]abeas petitions challenging the constitutionality of a resentencing proceeding are not successive to petitions that challenge the underlying conviction and original sentence” (citing 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 28.3b(i), p. 1412 (5th ed. 2005) (hereinafter Hertz & Libman) (“When a petitioner files a second or subsequent petition to challenge a criminal judgment other than the one attacked in an earlier petition, it cannot be said that the two petitions are 'successive' ” (emphasis in original)))). The District Court rejected the State's argument that Magwood had procedurally defaulted the fair-warning claim by failing to present it adequately to the state courts, noting that Magwood had presented the claim both in his Rule 20 petition and on appeal from the denial of that petition. 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285-1286; supra, at 326-327, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 599. Addressing the merits, the District Court ruled that Magwood's death sentence was unconstitutional because “at the time of the offense conduct, Magwood did not have fair notice that he could be sentenced to death absent at least one aggravating circumstance enumerated in former 1975 Ala. Code § 13-11-6.” 481 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285. The District Court also  found the state court's grounds for rejecting Magwood's ineffective-assistance claim unreasonable in light of clearly established federal law, noting that Magwood's attorney in fact had engaged substantively in the “complete and new” resentencing, and although the attorney could not be expected to object on state-law grounds foreclosed by precedent, he was clearly ineffective for failing to raise the federal fair-warning claim. Id., at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part. 555 F.3d 968 (CA11 2009). It concluded that the first step in determining whether § 2244(b) applies is to “separate the new claims challenging the resentencing from the old claims that were or should have been presented in the prior application.” Id., at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the Court of Appeals' approach, any claim that “challenge[s] the new, amended component of the sentence” should be “regarded as part of a first petition,” and any claim that “challenge[s] any component of the original sentence that was not amended” should be “regarded as part of a second petition.” Ibid. Applying this test, the court held that because Magwood's fair-warning claim challenged the trial court's reliance on the same (allegedly improper) aggravating factor that the trial court had relied upon for Magwood's original sentence, his claim was governed by § 2244(b)'s restrictions on “second or successive” habeas applications. Id., at 975-976. The Court of Appeals then dismissed the claim because Magwood did not argue that it was reviewable under one of the exceptions to § 2244(b)'s general rule requiring dismissal of claims first presented in a successive application.7The court treated Magwood's ineffective-assistance claim as new and free of the restrictions of § 2244(b)(2), but reversed on the merits: “While there was a possible objection, Alabama's highest court had said in Kyzer that a § 13-11-2 aggravating factor could be used as an aggravating circumstance. We are not prepared to require counsel to raise an argument that has already been decided adversely to his client's position by a state's highest court in order to avoid being found ineffective.” 555 F.3d at, 977-978. See id., at 976.

 We granted certiorari to determine whether Magwood's application challenging his 1986 death sentence, imposed as part of resentencing in response to a conditional writ from the District Court, is subject to the constraints that § 2244(b) imposes on the review of “second or successive” habeas applications. 558 U.S. 1023, 130 S. Ct. 624, 175 L. Ed. 2d 477 (2009).

II 

As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) provides in relevant part:

“(1) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed.“(2) A claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section 2254 that was not presented in a prior application shall be dismissed unless--“(A) the applicant shows that the claim relies on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or“(B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence; and“(ii) the facts underlying the claim, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.”

This case turns on the meaning of the phrase “second or successive” in § 2244(b). More specifically, it turns on when a claim should be deemed to arise in a “second or successive habeas corpus application.” §§ 2244(b)(1), (2).  If an application  is “second or successive,” the petitioner must obtain leave from the court of appeals before filing it with the district court. See § 2244(b)(3)(A). The district court must dismiss any claim presented in an authorized second or successive application unless the applicant shows that the claim satisfies certain statutory requirements. See § 2244(b)(4). Thus, if Magwood's application was “second or successive,” the District Court should have dismissed it in its entirety because he failed to obtain the requisite authorization from the Court of Appeals. If, however, Magwood's application was not second or successive, it was not subject to § 2244(b) at all, and his fair-warning claim was reviewable (absent procedural default).

The State contends that although § 2244(b), as amended by AEDPA, applies the phrase “second or successive” to “application[s],” it “is a claim-focused statute,” Brief for Respondents 22-24, and “[c]laims, not applications, are barred by § 2244(b),” id., at 24 (citing Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 9, 121 S. Ct. 361, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213 (2000)). According to the State, the phrase should be read to reflect a principle that “a prisoner is entitled to one, but only one, full and fair opportunity to wage a collateral attack.” See Brief for Respondents 25-26 (citing Beyer v. Litscher,306 F.3d 504, 508 (CA7 2002); internal quotation marks omitted). The State asserts that under this “one opportunity” rule, Magwood's fair-warning claim was successive because he had an opportunity to raise it in his first application, but did not do so. See Brief for Respondents 25-26.

Magwood, in contrast, reads § 2244(b) to apply only to a “second or successive” application challenging the same state-court judgment. According to Magwood, his 1986 resentencing led to a new judgment, and his first application challenging that new judgment cannot be “second or successive” such that § 2244(b) would apply. We agree.

We begin with the text.  Although Congress did not define the phrase “second or successive,” as used to modify  “habeas corpus application under section 2254,” §§ 2244(b)(1)-(2), it is well settled that the phrase does not simply “refe[r] to all § 2254 applications filed second or successively in time,” Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 944, 127 S. Ct. 2842, 168 L. Ed. 2d 662 (2007); see id., at 947, 127 S. Ct. 2842, 168 L. Ed. 2d 662 (creating an “exceptio[n]” to § 2244(b) for a second application raising a claim that would have been unripe had the petitioner presented it in his first application); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 643, 118 S. Ct. 1618, 140 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1998) (treating a second application as part of a first application where it was premised on a newly ripened claim that had been dismissed from the first application “as premature”); Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 478, 487, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000) (declining to apply§ 2244(b) to a second application where the District Court dismissed the first application for lack of exhaustion).8In Slack v. McDaniel, we applied pre-AEDPA law, but “d[id] not suggest the definition of second or successive would be different under AEDPA.” 529 U.S., at 486, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542. Courts have followed Slack in post-AEDPA cases, and the State agrees it is relevant to the question presented here. See Brief for Respondents 36, n. 13.

We have described the phrase “second or successive” as a “term of art.” Id., at 486, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542. To determine its meaning, we look first to the statutory context. The limitations imposed by § 2244(b) apply only to a “habeas corpus application under section 2254,” that is, an “application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court,” § 2254(b)(1) (emphasis added). The reference to a state-court judgment in § 2254(b) is significant because the term “application” cannot be defined in a vacuum. A § 2254 petitioner is applying for something: His petition “seeks invalidation (in whole or in part) of thejudgment authorizing the prisoner's confinement,” Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 U.S. 74, 83, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (2005) (emphasis added). If his petition results in a district court's granting of the writ, “the State may seek a new judgment (through a new trial or a new sentencing proceeding).” Ibid. (emphasis in original). Thus, both § 2254(b)'s text and the relief it provides indicate  that the phrase “second or successive” must be interpreted with respect to the judgment challenged.

The State disagrees, contending that if the cross-reference to § 2254 is relevant, we should focus not on the statute's reference to a “judgment” but on its reference to “custody,” Brief for Respondents 53; compare §§ 2254(a), (b) (establishing rules for review of “[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus” on “behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court” (emphasis added)) with § 2254(a) (specifying that an application may be entertained “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is incustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States” (emphasis added)). The State explains that unlawful “custody” is the key “ 'substance requirement' ” of § 2254, whereas being held pursuant to a state-court “judgment” is merely a “ 'status requirement.' ” Brief for Respondents 53 (quoting 1 Hertz & Liebman § 8.1, at 391).

We find this argument unpersuasive. Section 2254 articulates the kind of confinement that may be challenged on the ground that the petitioner is being held “in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” § 2254(a). The requirement of custody pursuant to astate-court judgment distinguishes § 2254 from other statutory provisions authorizing relief from constitutional violations--such as § 2255, which allows challenges to the judgments of federal courts, or Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which allows federal-court suits against state and local officials. Custody is crucial for § 2254 purposes, but it is inextricable from the judgment that authorizes it.

The State's “custody”-based rule is difficult to justify for another reason. Under the State's approach, applying the phrase “second or successive” to any subsequent application filed before a prisoner's release would mean that a prisoner who remains in continuous custody for a completely unrelated conviction would have to satisfy the strict rules for review under § 2244(b) to challenge his unrelated conviction for the first time. Nothing in the statutory text or context supports, much less requires, such an anomalous result. See, e.g., Beyer,306 F.3d, at 507 (“[A] prisoner is entitled to one free-standing collateral attack per judgment, rather than one attack per stretch of imprisonment”); cf. Dotson, supra, at 85, 125 S. Ct. 1242, 161 L. Ed. 2d 253 (Scalia, J., concurring) (“[W]hen a habeas petitioner challenges only one of several consecutive sentences, the court may invalidate the challenged sentence even though the prisoner remains in custody to serve the others”).9 Our focus on the judgment accords with current filing requirements. See Habeas Corpus Rule 2(b) (requiring any petitioner to “ask for relief from the state-court judgment being contested”); Rule 2(e) (prescribing that any “petitioner who seeks relief from judgments of more than one state court must file a separate petition covering the judgment or judgments of each court”).

III 

Appearing to recognize that Magwood has the stronger textual argument, the State argues that we should rule based on the statutory purpose. According to the State, a “one opportunity” rule is consistent with the statutory text, and better reflects AEDPA's purpose of preventing piecemeal litigation and gamesmanship.

We are not persuaded. AEDPA uses the phrase “second or successive” to modify “application.” See §§ 2244(b)(1), (2). The State reads the phrase to modify “claims.” See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 51 (“Congress' intent for AEDPA was to eradicate successive claims”). We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent. We have previously found Congress' use of the word “application” significant, and have refused to adopt an interpretation of § 2244(b) that would “elid[e] the difference between an 'application' and a 'claim,' Artuz, 531 U.S., at 9, 121 S. Ct. 361, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213; see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 530, 125 S. Ct. 2641, 162 L. Ed. 2d 480 (2005)(“[F]or purposes of § 2244(b), an 'application' for habeas relief is a filing that contains one or more 'claims' ”). Therefore, although we agree with the State that many of the rules under § 2244(b) focus  on claims, that does not entitle us to rewrite the statute to make the phrase “second or successive” modify claims as well.10The dissent recognizes that the phrase “second or successive” applies to an application as a whole, see post, at 344-346, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 610 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), but departs in other significant ways from the statutory text, see infra, at 336-337, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 604.

The State's reading leads to a second, more fundamental error. Under the State's “one opportunity” rule, the phrase “second or successive” would apply to any claim that the petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to raise in a prior application. And the phrase “second or successive” would not apply to a claim that the petitioner did not have a full and fair opportunity to raise previously.

This reading of § 2244(b) would considerably undermine--if not render superfluous--the exceptions to dismissal set forth in § 2244(b)(2). That section describes circumstances when a claim not presented earlier may be considered: intervening and retroactive case law, or newly discovered facts suggesting “that . . . no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.” § 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii). In either circumstance, a petitioner cannot be said to have had a prior opportunity to raise the claim, so under the State's rule the claim would not be successive and § 2244(b)(2) would not apply to it at all. This would be true even if the claim were raised in a second application challenging the same judgment.11This case does not require us to determine whether § 2244(b) applies to every application filed by a prisoner in custody pursuant to a state-court judgment if the prisoner challenged the same state-court judgment once before. Three times we have held otherwise. See Slack v. McDaniel,529 U.S. 473, 487, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542 (2000); Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal,523 U.S. 637, 643, 118 S. Ct. 1618, 140 L. Ed. 2d 849 (1998); Panetti v. Quarterman,551 U.S. 930, 945, 127 S. Ct. 2842, 168 L. Ed. 2d 662 (2007). The dissent's claim that our reading of § 2244(b) calls one of those decisions, Panetti, into doubt, see post, at 350, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 613, is unfounded. The question in this case is whether a first application challenging a new sentence in an intervening judgment is second or successive. It is not whether an application challenging the same state-court judgment must always be second or successive.

 In addition to duplicating the exceptions under § 2244(b) in some circumstances, the State's rule would dilute them in others. Whereas the exception to dismissal of fact-based claims not presented in a prior application applies only if the facts provide clear and convincing evidence “that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense,” § 2244(b)(2)(B)(ii), under the State's rule, all that matters is that the facts “could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence,” § 2244(b)(2)(B)(i). We decline to adopt a reading that would thus truncate § 2244(b)(2)'s requirements.

IV

A 

We are not persuaded by the State or the dissent that the approach we take here contradicts our precedents. The State invokes several pre-AEDPA cases denying review of claims in second or successive applications where the petitioners did not avail themselves of prior opportunities to present the claims. See Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U.S. 239, 44 S. Ct. 524, 68 L. Ed. 999 (1924); Antone v. Dugger, 465 U.S. 200, 104 S. Ct. 962, 79 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1984)(per curiam); Woodard v. Hutchins, 464 U.S. 377, 104 S. Ct. 752, 78 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1984)(per curiam); Delo v. Stokes, 495 U.S. 320, 110 S. Ct. 1880, 109 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1990)(per curiam);McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 111 S. Ct. 1454, 113 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1991). These cases, the State contends, show that Magwood's fair-warning claim should be dismissed as second or successive because he could have raised--but did not raise--the claim in his first application.

But none of these pre-AEDPA decisions applies the phrase “second or successive” to an application challenging a new judgment. Therefore, the decisions cast no light on the question before the Court today: whether abuse-of-the-writ rules, as modified by AEDPA under § 2244(b)(2), apply at all to an application challenging a new judgment. The State's misplaced reliance on those cases stems from its failure  to distinguish between § 2244(b)'s threshold inquiry into whether an application is “second or successive,” and its subsequent inquiry into whether claims in a successive application must be dismissed.

B 

The dissent similarly errs by interpreting the phrase “second or successive” by reference to our longstanding doctrine governing abuse of the writ. AEDPA modifies those abuse-of-the-writ principles and creates new statutory rules under § 2244(b). These rules apply only to “second or successive” applications. The dissent contends that this reading renders AEDPA inapplicable to a broad range of abusive claims that would have been barred under prior rules. Yet, the dissent fails to cite any case in which this Court has dismissed a claim as successive or abusive if the petitioner raised it in an application challenging a new judgment.

The dissent's conclusion that our reading of § 2254 “unmoor[s] the phrase 'second or successive' from its textual and historical underpinnings,” post, at 350, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 615, is unwarranted. Pre-AEDPA usage of the phrase “second or successive” is consistent with our reading. A review of our habeas precedents shows that pre-AEDPA cases cannot affirmatively define the phrase “second or successive” as it appears in AEDPA. Congress did not even apply the phrase “second or successive” to applications filed by state prisoners until it enacted AEDPA. The phrase originally arose in the federal context, see § 2255 (1946 ed., Supp. II), and applied only to applications raising previously adjudicated claims, see Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 12, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963). After this Court interpreted the law to permit dismissal of “abusive” claims--as distinguished from “successive” claims, see ibid.--Congress codified restrictions on both types of claims in § 2244(b), but still without using the phrase “second or successive.” See § 2244(b) (1964 ed., Supp. IV) (providing rules governing applications filed by state as well as federal prisoners). It was not until 1996 that AEDPA incorporated the  phrase “second or successive” into § 2244(b). In light of this complex history of the phrase “second or successive,” we must rely upon the current text to determine when the phrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or superseded statutory formulations.12The dissent speculates about issues far beyond the question before the Court. See, e.g., post, at 350-351, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 615-616 (suggesting that our judgment-based reading of § 2244(b) calls into question precedents recognizing habeas petitions challenging the denial of good-time credits or parole). We address only an application challenging a new state-court judgment for the first time. We do not purport to constrain the scope of § 2254 as we have previously defined it.

C 

Nor do our post-AEDPA cases contradict our approach. Only one, Burton v. Stewart, 549 U.S. 147, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628 (2007)(per curiam), comes close to addressing the threshold question whether an application is “second or successive” if it challenges a new judgment. And that case confirms that the existence of a new judgment is dispositive. In Burton, the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced in state court in 1994. See id., at 149, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628 . He successfully moved for resentencing based on vacatur of an unrelated prior conviction. Id., at 150, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628. The state appellate court affirmed the conviction but remanded for a second resentencing. Ibid. In March 1998, the trial court entered an amended judgment and new sentence. Id., at 151, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628. In December 1998, with state review of his new sentence still pending, the petitioner filed a § 2254 application challenging his 1994 conviction. The District Court denied it on the merits, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and we denied certiorari. Ibid.

In 2002, after exhausting his state sentencing appeal, the petitioner filed a § 2254 petition challenging only his 1998 sentence. The District Court denied relief on the merits, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed, holding that the petition challenging the sentence should have been  dismissed as an unauthorized “second or successive” application. Id., at 153, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628; see § 2244(b)(3)(A). We rejected petitioner's argument “that his 1998 and 2002 petitions challenged different judgments.” Id., at 155, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628; see id., at 156-157, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628. Although the petitioner had styled his first petition as a challenge to the 1994 conviction and his second petition as a challenge to the 1998 sentence, we concluded that both attacked the same “judgment” because the 1998 sentence was already in place when the petitioner filed his first application for federal habeas relief. See id., at 156, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628. In other words, the judgment he challenged in his 1998 application was “the same one challenged in the subsequent 2002 petition”; it “was the judgment pursuant to which [the petitioner] was being detained.” Ibid. (emphasis added). We expressly recognized that the case might have been different had there been a “new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions.” Ibid. There was no such judgment in Burton, but there is such an intervening judgment here.

This is Magwood's first application challenging that intervening judgment. The errors he alleges are new. It is obvious to us--and the State does not dispute--that his claim of ineffective assistance at resentencing turns upon new errors. But, according to the State, his fair-warning claim does not, because the state court made the same mistake before. We disagree. An error made a second time is still a new error. That is especially clear here, where the state court conducted a full resentencing and reviewed the aggravating evidence afresh. See Sentencing Tr., R. Tab 1, at R-25 (“The Court in f[or]mulating the present judgment has considered the original record of the trial and sentence. . . . The present judgment and sentence has been the result of a complete and new assessment of all of the evidence, arguments of counsel, and law” (emphasis added)).13Cf. Walker v. Roth, 133 F.3d 454, 455 (CA7 1997) (“None of these new claims were raised in his first petition, nor could they have been; [the petitioner] is attempting to challenge the constitutionality of a proceeding which obviously occurred after he filed, and obtained relief, in his first habeas petition”).

D 

The dissent's concern that our rule will allow “petitioners to bring abusive claims so long as they have won any victory pursuant to a prior federal habeas petition,” post, at 356, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 618, is greatly exaggerated.  A petitioner may not raise in federal court an error that he failed to raise properly in state court in a challenge to the judgment reflecting the error. If a petitioner does not satisfy the procedural requirements for bringing an error to the state court's attention--whether in trial, appellate, or habeas proceedings, as state law may require--procedural default will bar federal review. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729-730, 111 S. Ct. 2546, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1991); O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 848, 119 S. Ct. 1728, 144 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1999) (stating that the petitioner's “failure to present three of his federal habeas claims to the [state court] in a timely fashion has resulted in a procedural default of those claims”). In this case, the State argued that Magwood procedurally defaulted his fair-warning claim by failing to raise it properly in his collateral challenge to the 1986 judgment, and sought dismissal on that ground. Only after ruling that Magwood did not procedurally default the claim did the District Courtsua sponte consider whether § 2244(b) barred review.14See 481 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1267 (MD Ala. 2007) (“This court split the proceedings on the current petition into two stages: stage I (determining whether the claims were procedurally defaulted) and stage II (considering the merits of the claims that were not procedurally defaulted)”). Few of Magwood's claims survived the initial cut. We leave that procedural-default ruling to the Court of Appeals to review in the first instance. Here, we underscore only that procedural-default rules continue to constrain review of claims in all applications, whether the applications are “second or successive” or not.15The dissent's concern that such a petitioner may “reraise every argument against a sentence that was rejected by the federal courts during the first round of federal habeas review,” post, at 354, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 616, is similarly hyperbolic. It will not take a court long to dispose of such claims where the court has already analyzed the legal issues.

Ironically, in an effort to effectuate what they believe is Congress' intent not to give any unfair benefit to habeas petitioners, the State and the dissent propose an alternative rule that would “close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was Congress' intent.” Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 381, 124 S. Ct. 786, 157 L. Ed. 2d 778 (2003). Many examples can be given, but one suffices to illustrate this point. Suppose that a petitioner files an application raising 10 meritorious claims challenging his conviction. The district court grants a conditional writ based on one of them, without reaching the remaining nine. Upon retrial, the state court commits the same 10 legal mistakes. (These are new errors, but no more new than the sentencing error in Magwood's case.) Is an application presenting those same 10 claims--now based on the errors in the new judgment--“second or successive”? Under the opportunity-based rule advanced by the State and the dissent, the answer must be yes. All 10 claims would have to be dismissed. See § 2244(b)(1) (requiring dismissal of any claim presented in a prior application). The State attempts to avoid this “procedural anomal[y],” id., at 380, 124 S. Ct. 786, 157 L. Ed. 2d 778, by suggesting that we treat the nine unadjudicated claims as part of a first application, because they were never adjudicated on the merits. Cf. Slack,529 U.S., at 478-481, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542; Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S., at 643-645, 118 S. Ct. 1618, 140 L. Ed. 2d 849 . As for the adjudicated claim, “[r]espondents assume that state judges will follow instructions imposed by federal courts,” and if not, “that federal courts will consider a petitioner's claim that the state court violated due process by failing to honor the federal court's mandate.” Brief for Respondents 42. We see no need to engage in such novel and complex rationalizations. AEDPA's text commands a more straightforward rule:  where, unlike in Burton, there is a “new judgment intervening between the two habeas petitions,” 549 U.S., at 156, 127 S. Ct. 793, 166 L. Ed. 2d 628 , an application challenging  the resulting new judgment is not “second or successive” at all.

V 

The State objects that our reading of § 2244(b) would allow a petitioner who obtains a conditional writ as to his sentence to file a subsequent application challenging not only his resulting, new sentence, but also his original, undisturbed conviction. The State believes this result follows because a sentence and conviction form a single “judgment” for purposes of habeas review. This case gives us no occasion to address that question, because Magwood has not attempted to challenge his underlying conviction.16 Several Courts of Appeals have held that a petitioner who succeeds on a first habeas application and is resentenced may challenge only the “portion of a judgment that arose as a result of a previous successful action.” Lang v. United States,474 F.3d 348, 351-352 (CA6 2007) (citing decisions); see also Walker, 133 F.3d, at 455, United States v. Esposito,135 F.3d 111, 113-114 (CA2 1997)(per curiam). We base our conclusion on the text, and that text is not altered by consequences the State speculates will follow in another case.17 In any case, we cannot agree with the dissent that our reading of § 2244(b) gives a windfall to “a defendant who succeeds on even the most minor and discrete issue.” Post, at 354, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 617. AEDPA permits relief “only on the ground that [the petitioner] is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” § 2254(a).

* * * 

For these reasons, we conclude that Magwood's first application challenging his new sentence under the 1986 judgment is not “second or successive” under § 2244(b). The Court of Appeals erred by reading § 2244(b) to bar review of the fair-warning claim Magwood presented in that application. We do not address whether the fair-warning claim is procedurally defaulted. Nor do we address Magwood's contention that the Court of Appeals erred in rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim by not addressing whether his attorney should have objected under federal law.

 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bankruptcy. We consider in this opinion two questions arising from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron executive, for crimes committed before the corporation's collapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial? Second, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of conspiracy to commit “honest-services” wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1343, 1346?

Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit affirmed Skilling's convictions. We conclude, in common with the Court of Appeals, that Skilling's fair-trial argument fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the Fifth Circuit's honest-services ruling.  In proscribing fraudulent deprivations of “the intangible right of honest services,” § 1346, Congress intended at least to reach schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Construing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that core meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness shoal. We therefore hold that § 1346 covers only bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling's alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within § 1346's proscription. We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part.

 I 

Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world's leading energy companies. Skilling launched his career there in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company's founder, hired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily rose through the corporation's ranks, serving as president and chief operating officer, and then, beginning in February 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on August 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.

Less than four months after Skilling's departure, Enron spiraled into bankruptcy. The company's stock, which had traded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to pennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend what caused the corporation's collapse, the U. S. Department of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising prosecutors and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents from around the Nation. The Government's investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron's short-run stock prices by overstating the company's financial well-being. In the years following Enron's bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up  the corporation's chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron's former chief accounting officer.

These three defendants, the indictment alleged,

“engaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the investing public, including Enron's shareholders, . . . about the true performance of Enron's businesses by: (a) manipulating Enron's publicly reported financial results; and (b) making public statements and representations about Enron's financial performance and results that were false and misleading.” App. P5, p. 277a.

Skilling and his co-conspirators, the indictment continued, “enriched themselves as a result of the scheme through salary, bonuses, grants of stock and stock options, other profits, and prestige.” Id., P14, at 280a.

Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud; in particular, it alleged that Skilling had sought to “depriv[e] Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of [his] honest services.” Id., P87, at 318a.1 The mail- and wire-fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or wires in furtherance of “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” 18 U.S.C. § 1341 (mail fraud); § 1343 (wire fraud). The honest-services statute, § 1346, defines “the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' ” in these provisions to include “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” The indictment further charged Skilling with more than 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enron's auditors, and insider trading.

In November 2004, Skilling moved to transfer the trial to another venue; he contended that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. To support this assertion, Skilling, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enron's downfall; he also presented affidavits from  the experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions,2 See United States v. Fastow, 292 F. Supp. 2d 914, 918 (SD Tex. 2003); Order in United States v. Hirko, No. 4:03-cr-00093 (SD Tex., Nov. 24, 2004), Record, Doc. 484, p. 6. These rulings were made by two other judges of the same District. Three judges residing in the area thus independently found that defendants in Enron-related cases could obtain a fair trial in Houston. denied the venue-transfer motion. Despite “isolated incidents of intemperate commentary,” the court observed, media coverage “ha[d] [mostly] been objective and unemotional,” and the facts of the case were “neither heinous nor sensational.” App. to Brief for United States 10a-11a.3 Painting a different picture of the media coverage surrounding Enron's collapse, Justice Sotomayor's opinion relies heavily on affidavits of media experts and jury consultants submitted by Skilling in support of his venue-transfer motion. E.g., post, at 428, 429-430, 431, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 672, 673, 673, 674 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); post, at 431, n. 2, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 674, and 448, n. 10, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 685; post, at 451, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 686, and 459-460, n. 22, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 691. These Skilling-employed experts selected and emphasized negative statements in various news stories. But the District Court Judge did not find the experts' samples representative of the coverage at large; having “[m]eticulous[ly] review[ed] all of the evidence” Skilling presented, the court concluded that “incidents [of news reports using] less-than-objective language” were dwarfed by “the largely fact-based tone of most of the articles.” App. to Brief for United States 7a, 10a, 11a. See also post, at 429, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 673 (acknowledging that “many of the stories were straightforward news items”). Moreover, “courts ha[d] commonly” favored “effective voir dire . . . to ferret out any [juror] bias.” Id., at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case, the court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston. Id., at 22a.

In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court solicited from the parties questions the court might use to screen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a questionnaire's  format and content, Skilling and the Government submitted dueling documents. On venire members' sources of Enron-related news, for example, the Government proposed that they tick boxes from a checklist of generic labels such as “[t]elevision,” “[n]ewspaper,” and “[r]adio,” Record 8415; Skilling proposed more probing questions asking venire members to list the specific names of their media sources and to report on “what st[ood] out in [their] mind[s]” of “all the things [they] ha[d] seen, heard or read about Enron,” id., at 8404-8405.

The District Court rejected the Government's sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling's submission. Skilling's questions “[we]re more helpful,” the court said, “because [they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow the potential jurors to give us more meaningful information.” Id., at 9539. The court converted Skilling's submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document that asked prospective jurors about, inter alia, their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.4 Questions included the following: “What are your opinions about the compensation that executives of large corporations receive?”; “Have you, any family members, or friends ever worked for or applied for work with,” “done business with,” or “owned stock in Enron Corporation or any Enron subsidiaries and partnership?”; “Do you know anyone . . . who has been negatively affected or hurt in any way by what happened at Enron?”; “Do you have an opinion about the cause of the collapse of Enron? If YES, what is your opinion? On what do you base your opinion?”; “Have you heard or read about any of the Enron cases? If YES, please tell us the name of all sources from which you have heard or read about the Enron cases.”; “Have you read any books or seen any movies about Enron? If YES, please describe.”; “Are you angry about what happened with Enron? If YES, please explain.”; “Do you have an opinion about . . . Jeffrey Skilling . . . [?] If YES, what is your opinion? On what do you base your opinion?”; “Based on anything you have heard, read, or been told[,] do you have any opinion about the guilt or innocence of . . . Jeffrey Skilling[?] If . . . YES . . . , please explain.”; “[W]ould any opinion you may have formed regarding Enron or any of the defendants prevent you from impartially considering the evidence presented during the trial of . . . Jeffrey Skilling[?] If YES or UNSURE . . . , please explain.”; “Is there anything else you feel is important for the court to know about you?” Record 13013-13026.

 In November 2005, the District Court mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all the addressees. The court granted hardship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, id., at 11773-11774, and the parties, with the court's approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability, id., at 11891, 13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, “each and every” prospective juror who said that a pre-existing opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from impartially considering the evidence at trial. Id., at 13668.

On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date scheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded guilty. Skilling's attorneys immediately requested a continuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the proceedings until the end of January 2006. Id., at 14277. In the interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey's guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial venue, Skilling urged that “jurors need to be questioned individually by both the Court and counsel” concerning their opinions of Enron and “publicity issues.” Id., at 12074.

The District Court again declined to move the trial. Skilling, the court concluded, still had not “establish[ed] that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d] a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.” Id., at 14115. The questionnaires and voir dire, the court observed, provided  safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. Id., at 14115-14116.

Denying Skilling's request for attorney-led voir dire, the court said that in 17 years on the bench:

“I've found . . . I get more forthcoming responses from potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I don't know whether people are suspicious of lawyers--but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the question.” Id., at 11805.

But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask followup questions, ibid., and it agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, id., at 11051-11053. The court also allotted the defendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than the standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). Id., at 13673-13675.

Voir dire began on January 30, 2006. The District Court first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartiality and explained the presumption of innocence and the Government's burden of proof. The trial, the court next instructed, was not a forum “to seek vengeance against Enron's former officers,” or to “provide remedies for” its victims. App. 823a. “The bottom line,” the court stressed, “is that we want . . . jurors who . . . will faithfully, conscientiously and impartially serve if selected.” Id., at 823a-824a. In response to the court's query whether any prospective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these instructions, two individuals indicated that they could not be fair; they were therefore excused for cause, id., at 816a, 819a-820a.

After questioning the venire as a group,5 Among other questions, the court asked whether sympathy toward the victims of Enron's collapse or a desire to see justice done would overpower prospective jurors' impartiality. App. 839a-840a. the District Court brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench  for individual examination. Although the questions varied, the process generally tracked the following format: The court asked about exposure to Enron-related news and the content of any stories that stood out in the prospective juror's mind. Next, the court homed in on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permitted each side to pose followup questions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away, the court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause. In all, the court granted one of the Government's for-cause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the defendants' challenges and denied six. The parties agreed to excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for hardship.

By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.6 Selection procedures of similar style and duration took place in three Enron-related criminal cases earlier prosecuted in Houston--United States v. Arthur Andersen LLP, No. 4:02-cr-00121-1 (SD Tex.) (charges against Enron's outside accountants); United States v. Bayly, No. 4:03-cr-00363 (SD Tex.) (charges against Merrill Lynch and Enron executives for alleged sham sales of Nigerian barges); United States v. Hirko, No. 4:03-cr-00093 (SD Tex.) (fraud and insider-trading charges against five Enron Broadband Services executives). See Brief for United States 9 (In all three cases, the District Court “distributed a jury questionnaire to a pool of several hundred potential jurors; dismissed individuals whose responses to the questionnaire demonstrated bias or other disqualifying characteristics; and, after further questioning by the court and counsel, selected a jury from the remaining venire in one day.”); Government's Memorandum of Law in Response to Defendants' Joint Motion to Transfer Venue in United States v. Skilling, et al., No. 4:04-cr-00025 (SD Tex., Dec. 3, 2004), Record, Doc. 231, pp. 21-28 (describing in depth the jury-selection process in the Arthur Andersen and Bayly trials). Before the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the seating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in fact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used peremptories to exclude them had he not exhausted his supply by striking  several venire members after the court refused to excuse them for cause. Supp. App. 3sa-4sa (Sealed).7Skilling had requested an additional peremptory strike each time the District Court rejected a for-cause objection. The court, which had already granted two extra peremptories, see supra, at 373, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 638, denied each request. The court overruled this objection.

After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told them they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow media accounts of the proceedings. “[E]ach of you,” the court explained, “needs to be absolutely sure that your decisions concerning the facts will be based only on the evidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.” App. 1026a.

Following a four-month trial and nearly five days of deliberation, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts. The District Court sentenced Skilling to 292 months' imprisonment, 3 years' supervised release, and $45 million in restitution.

On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his convictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services arguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron's collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554 F.3d 529, 559  (2009).8The Fifth Circuit described the media coverage as follows: “Local newspapers ran many personal interest stories in which sympathetic individuals expressed feelings of anger and betrayal toward Enron. . . . Even the [Houston] Chronicle's sports page wrote of Skilling's guilt as a foregone conclusion. Similarly, the Chronicle's 'Pethouse Pet of the Week' section mentioned that a pet had 'enjoyed watching those Enron jerks being led away in handcuffs.' These are but a few examples of the Chronicle's coverage.” 554 F.3d at, 559 (footnote omitted). The court also noted potential prejudice stemming from Causey's guilty plea and from the large number of victims in Houston--from the “[t]housands of Enron employees  . . . [who] lost their jobs, and . . . saw their 401(k) accounts wiped out,” to Houstonians who suffered spillover economic effects. Id., at 559-560.

The Court of Appeals stated, however, that “the presumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,” and it therefore examined the voir dire to determine whether “the District Court empaneled an impartial jury.” Id., at 561 (internal quotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted). The voir dire was, in the Fifth Circuit's view, “proper and thorough.” Id., at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skilling had challenged only one seated juror--Juror 11--for cause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments about corporate greed, the District Court “observed [his] demeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would make the government prove its case.” Id., at 564. In sum, the Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome the presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not “show[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced against him.” Ibid.

The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling's claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud. “[T]he jury was entitled to convict Skilling,” the court stated, “on these elements”: “(1) a material breach of a fiduciary duty . . . (2) that results in a detriment to the employer,” including one occasioned by an employee's decision to “withhold material information, i.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a reasonable employer to change its conduct.” Id., at 547. The Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling's argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague. Brief for Defendant-Appellant Skilling in No. 06-20885 (CA5), p. 65, n. 21.

Arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in its consideration of these claims, Skilling sought relief from this Court. We granted certiorari, 558 U.S. 945, 130 S. Ct. 393, 175 L. Ed. 2d 267 (2009), and now affirm in  part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.9 We also granted certiorari and heard arguments this Term in two other cases raising questions concerning the honest-services statute's scope. See Black v. United States, 561 U.S. 465, 476, 130 S. Ct. 2963, 177 L. Ed. 2d 695, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 5253; Weyhrauch v. United States,  561 U.S. 476, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 177 L. Ed. 2d 705, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 5254Today we vacate and remand those decisions in light of this opinion. Black, post, p. 465, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 5253; Weyhrauch, post, p. 476, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 5254. We consider first Skilling's allegation of juror prejudice, and next, his honest-services argument.

 II 

Pointing to “the community passion aroused by Enron's collapse and the vitriolic media treatment” aimed at him, Skilling argues that his trial “never should have proceeded in Houston.” Brief for Petitioner 20. And even if it had been possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, “[t]he truncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out prejudices,” he contends, so “[f]ar from rebutting the presumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively confirmed it.” Id., at 21. Skilling's fair-trial claim thus raises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court err by failing to move the trial to a different venue based on a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual prejudice contaminate Skilling's jury?10 Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of prejudice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling's petition for certiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when, if ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Although we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we consider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the question we agreed to decide. See this Court's Rule 14.1(a).

The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants the right to trial by an impartial jury. By constitutional design, that trial occurs “in the State where the . . . Crimes . . .  have been committed.” Art. III, § 2, cl. 3. See also Amdt. 6 (right to trial by “jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed”). The Constitution's place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at the defendant's request if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial--a “basic requirement of due process,” In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed. 942 (1955).11 Venue transfer in federal court is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21, which instructs that a “court must transfer the proceeding . . . to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.” As the language of the Rule suggests, district-court calls on the necessity of transfer are granted a healthy measure of appellate-court respect. See Platt v. Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co., 376 U.S. 240, 245, 84 S. Ct. 769, 11 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1964). Federal courts have invoked the Rule to move certain highly charged cases, for example, the prosecution arising from the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. See United States v. McVeigh, 918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996). They have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in cases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact, for example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, see United States v. Salameh, No. S5 93 Cr. 0180 (KTD), 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12770 (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); United States v. Yousef, No. S12 93 Cr. 180 (KTD), 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10449 (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff'd 327 F.3d 56, 155 (CA2 2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the press as the American Taliban, see United States v. Lindh, 212 F. Supp. 2d 541, 549-551 (ED Va. 2002). Skilling does not argue, distinct from his due process challenge, that the District Court abused its discretion under Rule 21 by declining to move his trial. We therefore review the District Court's venue-transfer decision only for compliance with the Constitution.

 “The theory of our [trial] system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.” Patterson v. Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., 205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 51 L. Ed. 879 (1907) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.). When does the  publicity attending conduct charged as criminal dim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due process requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence? Because most cases of consequence garner at least some pretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in diverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing the presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Circuit's analysis in Skilling's case proceeded. The foundation precedent is Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963).

Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana town, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession. Without informing Rideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the interrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before the trial, a local television station broadcast the film to audiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals. Rideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could not receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime occurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000 people. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury eventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld the conviction.

We reversed. “What the people [in the community] saw on their television sets,” we observed, “was Rideau, in jail, flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and murder.” Id., at 725, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663. “[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,” we explained, the interrogation “in a very real sense was Rideau's trial--at which he pleaded guilty.” Id., at 726, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663. We therefore “d[id] not hesitate to hold, without pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the voir dire,” that “[t]he kangaroo court proceedings” trailing the televised confession violated due process. Id., at 726-727, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663.

We followed Rideau's lead in two later cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution. In Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 538, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1965), extensive publicity  before trial swelled into excessive exposure during preliminary court proceedings as reporters and television crews overran the courtroom and “bombard[ed] . . . the community with the sights and sounds of” the pretrial hearing. The media's overzealous reporting efforts, we observed, “led to considerable disruption” and denied the “judicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol Estes] was entitled.” Id., at 536, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543.

Similarly, in Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966), news reporters extensively covered the story of Sam Sheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death. “[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom,” thrusting jurors “into the role of celebrities.” Id., at 353, 355, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. Pretrial media coverage, which we characterized as “months [of] virulent publicity about Sheppard and the murder,” did not alone deny due process, we noted. Id., at 354, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. But Sheppard's case involved more than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder conviction because a “carnival atmosphere” pervaded the trial, id., at 358, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600.

In each of these cases, we overturned a “conviction obtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted by press coverage”;  our decisions, however, “cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to . . . news accounts of the crime . . . alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.” Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 798-799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975).12Murphy involved the robbery prosecution of the notorious Jack Murphy, a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the 1964 heist of the Star of India sapphire from New York's American Museum of Natural History. Pointing to “extensive press coverage” about him, Murphy moved to transfer venue. 421 U.S., at 796, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury convicted Murphy. We affirmed. Murphy's trial, we explained, was markedly different from the proceedings at issue in Rideau v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 723, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963), Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S. 532, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1965), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966), which “entirely lack[ed] . . . the solemnity and sobriety to which a defendant is entitled in a system that subscribes to any notion of fairness and rejects the verdict of a mob.” 421 U.S., at 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589. Voir dire revealed no great hostility toward Murphy; “[s]ome of the jurors had a vague recollection of the robbery with which [he] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his] past crimes, but none betrayed any belief in the relevance of [his] past to the present case.” Id., at 800, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (footnote omitted). See also, e.g.,Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984).13 In Yount, the media reported on Jon Yount's confession to a brutal murder and his prior conviction for the crime, which had been reversed due to a violation of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). During voir dire, 77% of prospective jurors acknowledged they would carry an opinion into the jury box, and 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates admitted they had formed an opinion as to Yount's guilt. 467 U.S., at 1029-1030, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. Nevertheless, we rejected Yount's presumption-of-prejudice claim. The adverse publicity and community outrage, we noted, were at their height prior to Yount's first trial, four years before the second prosecution; time had helped “sooth[e] and eras[e]” community prejudice, id., at 1034, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. Prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror impartiality, we have reiterated, does not require ignorance. Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961) (Jurors are not required to be “totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved”; “scarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.”); Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 155-156, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1879) (“[E]very case of public interest is almost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention of all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely any one can be found among those best fitted for jurors who has not read or heard of it, and who has not some impression or some opinion in respect to its merits.”). A presumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends only the extreme case.

 3 

Relying on Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, Skilling asserts that we need not pause to examine the screening questionnaires or the voir dire before declaring his jury's verdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differences separate Skilling's prosecution from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice.14Skilling's reliance on Estes and Sheppardis particularly misplaced; those cases involved media interference with courtroom proceedings during trial. See supra, at 379-380, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 642. Skilling does not assert that news coverage reached and influenced his jury after it was empaneled.

First,  we have emphasized in prior decisions the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred. In Rideau, for example, we noted that the murder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents. Houston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in the Nation: At the time of Skilling's trial, more than 4.5 million individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the Houston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of potential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 429, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991) (potential for prejudice mitigated by the size of the “metropolitan Washington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed each year”); Gentile v. State Bar of Nev., 501 U.S. 1030, 1044, 111 S. Ct. 2720, 115 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1991) (plurality opinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was drawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).15 According to a survey commissioned by Skilling in conjunction with his first motion for a venue change, only 12.3% of Houstonians named him when asked to list Enron executives they believed guilty of crimes. App. 375a-376a. In response to the followup question “[w]hat words come to mind when you hear the name Jeff Skilling?”, two-thirds of respondents failed to say a single negative word, id., at 376a: 43% either had never heard of Skilling or stated that nothing came to mind when they heard his name, and another 23% knew Skilling's name was associated with Enron but reported no opinion about him, Record 3210-3211; see App. 417a-492a.

Second, although news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no confession or other blatantly prejudicial information of the type readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight. Rideau's dramatically  staged admission of guilt, for instance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of anyone who watched it. Cf. Parker v. Randolph, 442 U.S. 62, 72, 99 S. Ct. 2132, 60 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1979) (plurality opinion) (“[T]he defendant's own confession [is] probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skilling was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of the smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpability. See United States v. Chagra, 669 F.2d 241, 251-252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) ( “A jury may have difficulty in disbelieving or forgetting a defendant's opinion of his own guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of others because they may not be well-founded.”).

Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, e.g.,Rideau, 373 U.S., at 724, 83 S. CT. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663, over four years elapsed between Enron's bankruptcy and Skilling's trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enron's collapse. See App. 700a; id., at 785a; Yount, 467 U.S., at 1032, 1034, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847.

Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling's jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.16 As the United States summarizes, “[I]n Hirko, the jury deliberated for several days and did not convict any Enron defendant; in Bayly, which was routinely described as 'the first Enron criminal trial,' the jury convicted five defendants, . . . but acquitted a former Enron executive. At the sentencing phase of Bayly, the jury found a loss amount of slightly over $13 million, even though the government had argued that the true loss . . . was $40 million.” Brief for United States 9-10 (citation omitted). In Rideau, Estes, and Sheppard, in marked contrast, the jury's verdict did not undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors' actions run counter to that presumption. See, e.g.,United States v. Arzola-Amaya, 867 F.2d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (“The jury's ability to discern a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media coverage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an impartial trial.”).

 4 

Skilling's trial, in short, shares little in common with those in which we approved a presumption of juror prejudice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of media attention directed at Enron. But  “pretrial publicity--even pervasive, adverse publicity--does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.” Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976). In this case, as just noted, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information we have recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston's size and diversity diluted the media's impact.17The Fifth Circuit, moreover, did not separate media attention aimed at Skilling from that devoted to Enron's downfall more generally. Data submitted by Skilling in support of his first motion for a venue transfer suggested that a slim percentage of Enron-related stories specifically named him. App. 572a.  “[W]hen publicity is about the event, rather than directed at individual defendants, this may lessen any prejudicial impact.” United States v. Hueftle, 687 F.2d 1305, 1310 (CA10 1982).

Nor did Enron's “sheer number of victims,” 554 F.3d at, 560, trigger a presumption of prejudice. Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors' connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and followup voir dire were well suited to that task. And hindsight shows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss infra, at 389-390, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648, jurors' links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.

Finally, although Causey's “well-publicized decision to plead guilty” shortly before trial created a danger of juror  prejudice, 554 F.3d at, 559, the District Court took appropriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the proceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that development. And during voir dire, the court asked about prospective jurors' exposure to recent publicity, including news regarding Causey. Only two venire members recalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and neither ultimately served on Skilling's jury. App. 888a, 993a.  Although publicity about a codefendant's guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does not ordinarily--and, we are satisfied, it did not here--warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.

Persuaded that no presumption arose,18 The parties disagree about whether a presumption of prejudice can be rebutted, and, if it can, what standard of proof governs that issue. Compare Brief for Petitioner 25-35 with Brief for United States 24-32, 35-36. Because we hold that no presumption arose, we need not, and do not, reach these questions. we conclude that the District Court, in declining to order a venue change, did not exceed constitutional limitations.19 The dissent acknowledges that “the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling's motion to change venue.” Post, at 445, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 683. The dissent's conclusion that Skilling did not receive a fair trial accordingly turns on its perception of the adequacy of the jury-selection process.

 B 

We next consider whether actual prejudice infected Skilling's jury. Voir dire, Skilling asserts, did not adequately detect and defuse juror bias. “[T]he record . . . affirmatively confirm[s]” prejudice, he maintains, because several seated jurors “prejudged his guilt.” Brief for Petitioner 21. We disagree with Skilling's characterization of the voir dire and the jurors selected through it.

  1 

 No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of voir dire. See United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 145-146, 57 S. Ct. 177, 81 L. Ed. 78 (1936) (“Impartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.”). Jury selection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is “particularly within the province of the trial judge.” Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589, 594-595, 96 S. Ct. 1017, 47 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g.,Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 424, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493; Yount, 467 U.S., at 1038, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847; Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 188-189, 101 S. Ct. 1629, 68 L. Ed. 2d 22  (1981) (plurality opinion); Connors v. United States, 158 U.S. 408, 408-413, 15 S. Ct. 951, 39 L. Ed. 1033 (1895).

 When pretrial publicity is at issue, “primary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense” because the judge “sits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect” and may base her evaluation on her “own perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.” Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 427, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. Appellate courts making after-the-fact assessments of the media's impact on jurors should be mindful that their judgments lack the on-the-spot comprehension of the situation possessed by trial judges.

 Reviewing courts are properly resistant to second-guessing the trial judge's estimation of a juror's impartiality, for that judge's appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record--among them, the prospective juror's inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, body language, and apprehension of duty. See Reynolds, 98 U.S., at 156-157, 25 L. Ed. 244. In contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment voir dire affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member's fitness for jury  service. We consider the adequacy of jury selection in Skilling's case, therefore, attentive to the respect due to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.20 The dissent recognizes “the 'wide discretion' owed to trial courts when it comes to jury-related issues,” post, at 447, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 684 (quoting Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 427, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991)), but its analysis of the District Court's voir dire sometimes fails to demonstrate that awareness. For example, the dissent faults the District Court for not questioning prospective jurors regarding their “knowledge of or feelings about” Causey's guilty plea. Post, at 453, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 687. But the court could reasonably decline to ask direct questions involving Causey's plea to avoid tipping off until-that-moment uninformed venire members that the plea had occurred. Cf. App. 822a (counsel for Skilling urged District Court to find a way to question venire members about Causey “without mentioning anything”). Nothing inhibited defense counsel from inquiring about venire members' knowledge of the plea; indeed, counsel posed such a question, id., at 993a; cf. post, at 453, n. 14, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 687 (acknowledging that counsel “squeeze[d] in” an inquiry whether a venire member had “read about any guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two” (internal quotation marks omitted)). From this Court's lofty and “panoramic” vantage point, post, at 447, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 684, lines of voir dire inquiry that “might be helpful in assessing whether a juror is impartial” are not hard to conceive. Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 425, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493.  “To be constitutionally compelled, however, it is not enough that such questions might be helpful. Rather, the trial court's failure to ask these questions must render the defendant's trial fundamentally unfair.” Id., at 425-426, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. According appropriate deference to the District Court, we cannot characterize jury selection in this case as fundamentally unfair. Cf. supra, at 374, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639 (same selection process was used in other Enron-related prosecutions).

 2 

Skilling deems the voir dire insufficient because, he argues, jury selection lasted “just five hours,” “[m]ost of the court's questions were conclusory[,] high-level, and failed adequately to probe jurors' true feelings,” and the court “consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter what other indications of bias were present.” Brief for Petitioner 10-11 (emphasis  deleted). Our review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.21 In addition to focusing on the adequacy of voir dire, our decisions have also “take[n] into account . . . other measures [that] were used to mitigate the adverse effects of publicity.” Nebraska Press Ass'n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 565, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976). We have noted, for example, the prophylactic effect of “emphatic and clear instructions on the sworn duty of each juror to decide the issues only on evidence presented in open court.” Id., at 564, 565, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683. Here, the District Court's instructions were unequivocal; the jurors, the court emphasized, were dutybound “to reach a fair and impartial verdict in this case based solely on the evidence [they] hear[d] and read in th[e] courtroom.” App. 1026a. Peremptory challenges, too, “provid[e] protection against [prejudice],” United States ex rel. Darcy v. Handy, 351 U.S. 454, 462, 76 S. Ct. 965, 100 L. Ed. 1331 (1956); the District Court, as earlier noted, exercised its discretion to grant the defendants two extra peremptories, App. 1020a; see supra, at 373, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 638.

As noted, supra, at 370-372, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 637-638, and n. 4, the District Court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions put to remaining members of the array. Voir dire thus was, in the court's words, the “culmination of a lengthy process.” App. 841a; see 554 F.3d at, 562, n. 51 (“We consider the . . . questionnaire in assessing the quality of voir dire as a whole.”).22 The dissent's analysis undervalues the 77-item questionnaire, a part of the selection process difficult to portray as “cursory,” post, at 455, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 689, or “anemic,” post, at 460, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 691. Notably, the “open-ended questions about [prospective jurors'] impressions of Enron or Skilling” that the dissent contends should have been asked, post, at 455, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 689, were asked--on the questionnaire, see supra, at 371-372, n. 4, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 637. Moreover, the District Court gave Skilling's counsel relatively free rein to ask venire members about their responses on the questionnaire. See, e.g.,  App. 869a-870a; id., at 878a, 911a, 953a. The questionnaire plus followup opportunity to interrogate potential jurors surely gave Skilling's counsel “clear avenue[s] for . . . permissible inquiry.” But see post, at 456, n. 17, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 689. See also App. 967a (counsel for Skilling) (“Judge, for the record, if I don't ask any questions, it's because the Court and other counsel have covered it.”). In other Enron-related prosecutions,  we note, District Courts, after inspecting venire members' responses to questionnaires, completed the jury-selection process within one day. See supra, at 374, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639.23 One of the earlier prosecutions targeted the “Big Five” public accounting firm Arthur Andersen. See supra, at 374, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639. Among media readers and auditors, the name and reputation of Arthur Andersen likely sparked no less attention than the name and reputation of Jeffrey Skilling. Cf. supra, at 382, n. 15, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644.

The District Court conducted voir dire, moreover, aware of the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity, to ensure against jury bias. At Skilling's urging, the court examined each prospective juror individually, thus preventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other venire members. See Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 425, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. To encourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that there were “no right and wrong answers to th[e] questions.” E.g., App. 843a. The court denied Skilling's request for attorney-led voir dire because, in its experience, potential jurors were “more forthcoming” when the court, rather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805. The parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask followup questions of every prospective juror brought to the bench for colloquy. Skilling's counsel declined to ask anything of more than half of the venire members questioned individually, including eight eventually selected for the jury, because, he explained, “the Court and other counsel have covered” everything he wanted to know. App. 967a.

Inspection of the questionnaires and voir dire of the individuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that, notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process successfully secured jurors who were largely untouched by Enron's collapse.24 In considering whether Skilling was tried before an impartial jury, the dissent relies extensively on venire members not selected for that jury. See, e.g., post, at 432, n. 4, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 674 (quoting the questionnaires of 10 venire members; all were excused for cause before voir dire commenced, see Record 11891); post, at 433, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 675 (quoting the questionnaires of 15 venire members; none sat on Skilling's jury); post, at 436, n. 7, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 677 (quoting voir dire testimony of 6 venire members; none sat on Skilling's jury); post, at 453-458, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 688-691 (reporting at length voir dire testimony of Venire Members 17, 29, 61, 74, 75, and 101; none sat on Skilling's jury).  Statements by nonjurors do not themselves call into question the adequacy of the jury-selection process; elimination of these venire members is indeed one indicator that the process fulfilled its function. Critically, as discussed infra, at 391-392, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-649, the seated jurors showed little knowledge of or interest in, and were personally unaffected by, Enron's downfall. Eleven of the seated jurors and alternates  reported no connection at all to Enron, while all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial link. See, e.g., Supp. App. 101sa (Juror 63) (“I once met a guy who worked for Enron. I cannot remember his name.”).25 See also Supp. App. 11sa (Juror 10) (“knew some casual co-workers that owned Enron stock”); id., at 26sa (Juror 11) (“work[s] with someone who worked at Enron”); id., at 117sa; App. 940a (Juror 64) (two acquaintances lost money due to Enron's collapse); Supp. App. 236sa (Juror 116) (work colleague lost money as a result of Enron's bankruptcy). As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alternates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron-related news. See, e.g., App. 859a-860a (Juror 13) (would “[b]asically” start out knowing nothing about the case because “I just . . . didn't follow [it] a whole lot”); id., at 969a (Juror 78) (“[Enron] wasn't anything that I was interested in reading [about] in detail . . . . I don't really know much about it.”).26 See also App. 850a (Juror 10) (“I haven't followed [Enron-related news] in detail or to any extreme at all.”); id., at 856a (Juror 11) (did not “get into the details of [the Enron case]” and “just kind of tune[d] [it] out”); id., at 873a (Juror 20) (“I was out of [the] state when [Enron collapsed], and then personal circumstances kept me from paying much attention.”); id., at 892a (Juror 38) (recalled “nothing in particular” about media coverage); id., at 913a (Juror 50) (“I would hear it on the news and just let it filter in and out.”); id., at 935a (Juror 63) (“I don't really pay attention.”); id., at 940a-941a (Juror 64) (had “[n]ot really” been keeping up with and did not recall any news about Enron); id., at 971a (Juror 84) (had not read “anything at all about Enron” because he did not “want to read that stuff” (internal quotation marks omitted)); id., at 983a (Juror 90) (“seldom” read the Houston Chronicle and did not watch news programs); id., at 995a-996a (Juror 99) (did not read newspapers or watch the news; “I don't know the details on what [this case] is or what made it what it is”); id., at 1010a (Juror 113) (“never really paid that much attention [to] it”); id., at 1013a (Juror 116) (had “rea[d] a number of different articles,” but “since it hasn't affected me personally,” could not “specifically recall” any of them). The remaining  two jurors indicated that nothing in the news influenced their opinions about Skilling.27Id., at 944a (Juror 67) (had not read the Houston Chronicle in the three months preceding the trial and volunteered: “I don't form an opinion based on what . . . I hear on the news”); id., at 974a-975a (Juror 87) (had not “formed any opinions” about Skilling's guilt from news stories).

The questionnaires confirmed that, whatever community prejudice existed in Houston generally, Skilling's jurors were not under its sway.28 As the D. C. Circuit observed, reviewing the impact on jurors of media coverage of the Watergate scandal, “[t]his may come as a surprise to lawyers and judges, but it is simply a fact of life that matters which interest them may be less fascinating to the public generally.” United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31, 62-63, n. 37, 181 U.S. App. D.C. 254 (1976). See also In re Charlotte Observer, 882 F.2d 850, 855-856 (CA4 1989) (“[R]emarkably in the eyes of many,” “[c]ases such as those involving the Watergate defendants, the Abscam defendants, and . . . John DeLorean, all characterized by massive pretrial media reportage and commentary, nevertheless proceeded to trial with juries which . . . were satisfactorily disclosed to have been unaffected (indeed, in some instances blissfully unaware of or untouched) by that publicity.”); Brief for ABC, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 25-31 (describing other examples). Although many expressed sympathy for victims of Enron's bankruptcy and speculated that greed contributed to the corporation's collapse, these sentiments did not translate into animus toward Skilling. When asked whether they “ha[d] an opinion about . . . Jeffrey Skilling,” none of the seated jurors and alternates checked the “yes” box.29 One juror did not check any box, explaining that she lived in another State when Enron went bankrupt and therefore “was not fully aware of all the facts regarding Enron's fall [and] the media coverage.” Supp. App. 62sa (Juror 20). Two other jurors, Juror 10 and Juror 63, indicated in answer to a different question that they had an opinion about Skilling's guilt, but voir dire established they could be impartial. See infra, at 397-398, and 398, n. 33, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 653, and 654. And in response to the question whether “any opinion [they] may have formed regarding Enron or [Skilling]  [would] prevent” their impartial consideration of the evidence at trial, every juror--despite options to mark “yes” or “unsure”--instead checked “no.”

The District Court, Skilling asserts, should not have “accept[ed] at face value jurors' promises of fairness.” Brief for Petitioner 37. In Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S., at 727-728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751, Skilling points out, we found actual prejudice despite jurors' assurances that they could be impartial. Brief for Petitioner 26. Justice Sotomayor, in turn, repeatedly relies on Irvin, which she regards as closely analogous to this case. See post, at 448, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 685 (dissent). See also, e.g., post, at 441-442, 458, 460, 464, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 680-681, 690, 692, 694. We disagree with that characterization of Irvin.

The facts of Irvin are worlds apart from those presented here. Leslie Irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and robbery spree in a small rural community. 366 U.S., at 719, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. In the months before Irvin's trial, “a barrage” of publicity was “unleashed against him,” including reports of his confessions to the slayings and robberies. Id., at 725-726, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. This Court's description of the media coverage in Irvin reveals why the dissent's “best case” is not an apt comparison:

“[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin's] background, including a reference to crimes committed when a juvenile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years previously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL charges during the war. He was accused of being a parole violator. The headlines announced his police line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test, had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess. Finally, they announced [Irvin's] confession to the six murders and the fact of his indictment for four of them in Indiana. They reported [Irvin's] offer to plead guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the determination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had confessed to 24 burglaries (the modus operandi of these robberies was compared to that of the  murders and the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing [Irvin's] execution . . . . Another characterized [Irvin] as remorseless and without conscience but also as having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described as the 'confessed slayer of six,' a parole violator and fraudulent-check artist. [Irvin's] court-appointed counsel was quoted as having received 'much criticism over being Irvin's counsel' and it was pointed out, by way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On the day before the trial the newspapers carried the story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of [one victim] as well as 'the robbery-murder of [a second individual]; the murder of [a third individual], and the slaughter of three members of [a different family].' Ibid..

“[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were delivered regularly to approximately 95% of the dwellings in” the county where the trial occurred, which had a population of only 30,000; “radio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed that county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the same incidents.” Id., at 725, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751.

Reviewing Irvin's fair-trial claim, this Court noted that “the pattern of deep and bitter prejudice” in the community “was clearly reflected in the sum total of the voir dire”: “370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those examined on the point . . . entertained some opinion as to guilt,” and “[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.” Id., at 727, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although these jurors declared they could be impartial, we held that, “[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much that [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one in which two-thirds of  the members admit, before hearing any testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.” Id., at 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751.

In this case, as noted supra, at 382-383, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644, news stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Irvin's rampage of robberies and murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvin's trial proceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in Irvin, see App. to Brief for United States 15a (“The Houston Chronicle . . . reaches less than one-third of occupied households in Houston.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Skilling's seated jurors, moreover, exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in Irvin. See supra, at 389-392, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-649 (noting, inter alia, that none of Skilling's jurors answered “yes” when asked if they “ha[d] an opinion about . . . Skilling”). See also post, at 444, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 682 (dissent) (distinguishing Mu'Min from Irvin on similar bases: the “offense occurred in [a large] metropolitan . . . area,” media “coverage was not as pervasive as in Irvin and did not contain the same sort of damaging information,” and “the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In light of these large differences, the District Court had far less reason than did the trial court in Irvin to discredit jurors' promises of fairness.

The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire members who proclaimed their impartiality at their word.30 The court viewed with skepticism, for example, Venire Member 104's promises that she could “abide by law,” follow the court's instructions, and find Skilling not guilty if the Government did not prove its case, App. 1004a; “I have to gauge . . . demeanor, all the answers she gave me,” the court stated, and “[s]he persuaded me that she could not be fair and impartial, so she's excused,” id., at 1006a. As noted, all of Skilling's jurors had already affirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no trouble basing  a verdict only on the evidence at trial. Nevertheless, the court followed up with each individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors' backgrounds, opinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service. See 554 F.3d at, 562 (The District Court made “thorough” credibility determinations that “requir[ed] more than just the [venire members'] statements that [they] could be fair.”). The jury's not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts after nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests the court's assessments were accurate. See United States v. Haldeman, 559 F.2d 31, 60, n. 28, 181 U.S. App. D.C. 254 (CADC 1976). Skilling, we conclude, failed to show that his voir dire fell short of constitutional requirements.31 Skilling emphasizes that voir dire did not weed out every juror who suffered from Enron's collapse because the District Court failed to grant his for-cause challenge to Venire Member 29, whose retirement fund lost $50,000 due to ripple effects from the decline in the value of Enron stock. App. 880a. Critically, however, Venire Member 29 did not sit on Skilling's jury: Instead, Skilling struck her using a peremptory challenge.  “[I]f [a] defendant elects to cure [a trial judge's erroneous for-cause ruling] by exercising a peremptory challenge, and is subsequently convicted by a jury on which no biased juror sat,” we have held, “he has not been deprived of any . . . constitutional right.” United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 307, 120 S. Ct. 774, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792 (2000). Indeed, the “use [of] a peremptory challenge to effect an instantaneous cure of the error” exemplifies “a principal reason for peremptories: to help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impartial jury.” Id., at 316, 307, 120 S. Ct. 774, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792.

 3 

Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and contends they were openly biased. See United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 316, 120 S. Ct. 774, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792 (2000) ( “[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause . . . require[s] reversal.”). In reviewing claims of this type, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: “A trial court's findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.” Mu'Min, 500 U.S., at 428, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause, “strong evidence that he was convinced the [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.” Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S. 541, 557-558, 82 S. Ct. 955, 8 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to Skilling's specific allegations of juror partiality.

Skilling contends that Juror 11--the only seated juror he challenged for cause--“expressed the most obvious bias.” Brief for Petitioner 35. See also post, at 460-461, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 692 (dissent). Juror 11 stated that ?greed on Enron's part” triggered the company's bankruptcy and that corporate executives, driven by avarice, “walk a line that stretches sometimes the legality of something.” App. 854a-855a. But, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11

“had 'no idea' whether Skilling had 'crossed that line,' and he 'didn't say that' every CEO is probably a crook. He also asserted that he could be fair and require the government to prove its case, that he did not believe everything he read in the paper, that he did not 'get into the details' of the Enron coverage, that he did not watch television, and that Enron was 'old news.' 554 F.3d at, 563-564.

Despite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that Skilling “earned [his] salar[y],” App. 857a, and said he would have “no problem” telling his co-worker, who had lost 401(k) funds due to Enron's collapse, that the jury voted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, id., at 854a. The District Court, noting that it had “looked [Juror 11] in the eye and . . . heard all his [answers],” found his assertions of impartiality credible. Id., at 858a; cf. supra, at 394, n. 30, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. We agree with the  Court of Appeals that “[t]he express finding that Juror 11 was fair is not reversible error.” 554 F.3d at, 564.32Skilling's trial counsel and jury consultants apparently did not regard Juror 11 as so “obvious[ly] bias[ed],” Brief for Petitioner 35, as to warrant exercise of a peremptory challenge.

Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six specific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he not already exhausted his peremptory challenges. See supra, at 374-375, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639-640. Juror 20, he observes, “said she was 'angry' about Enron's collapse and that she, too, had been 'forced to forfeit [her] own 401(k) funds to survive layoffs.' ” Reply Brief 13. But Juror 20 made clear during voir dire that she did not “personally blame” Skilling for the loss of her retirement account. App. 875a. Having not “pa[id] much attention” to Enron-related news, she “quite honestly” did not “have enough information to know” whether Skilling was probably guilty, id., at 873a, and she “th[ought] [she] could be” fair and impartial, id., at 875a. In light of these answers, the District Court did not commit manifest error in finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.

The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out, wrote on her questionnaire “that [Skilling] 'probably knew [he] w[as] breaking the law.' ” Reply Brief 13. During voir dire, however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not “really have an opinion [about Skilling's guilt] either way,” App. 936a; she did not “know what [she] was thinking” when she completed the questionnaire, but she “absolutely” presumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her understanding that the Government would “have to prove” his guilt, id., at 937a. In response to followup questions from Skilling's counsel, she again stated she would not presume that Skilling violated any laws and could “[a]bsolutely” give her word that she could be fair. Id., at 937a-938a. “Jurors,” we have recognized, “cannot be expected invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently.” Yount, 467 U.S., at 1039, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. See also id., at 1040, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (“It is here that the federal [appellate]  court's deference must operate, for while the cold record arouses some concern, only the trial judge could tell which of these answers was said with the greatest comprehension and certainty.”). From where we sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.

The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign of prejudice we can discern. See App. 891a-892a (Juror 38) (remembered no media coverage about Enron and said nothing in her experience would prevent her from being fair and impartial); Supp. App. 131sa-133sa, 136sa (Juror 67) (had no connection to Enron and no anger about its collapse); App. 969a (Juror 78) (did not “know much about” Enron); Supp. App. 165sa; App. 971a (Juror 84) (had not heard or read anything about Enron and said she did not “know enough to answer” the question whether she was angry about the company's demise). Skilling's counsel declined to ask followup questions of any of these jurors and, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because she “gave all the right answers.” Id., at 972a. Whatever Skilling's reasons for wanting to strike these four individuals from his jury, he cannot credibly assert they displayed a disqualifying bias.33 Although Skilling raised no objection to Juror 10 and Juror 87 at trial, his briefs in this Court impugn their impartiality. Brief for Petitioner 14-15; Reply Brief 13. Even if we allowed these tardy pleas, the voir dire testimony of the two jurors gives sufficient assurance that they were unbiased. See, e.g., App. 850a-853a (Juror 10) (did not prejudge Skilling's guilt, indicated he could follow the court's instructions and make the Government prove its case, stated he could be fair to Skilling, and said he would “judge on the facts”); id., at 974a (Juror 87) (had “not formed an opinion” on whether Skilling was guilty and affirmed she could adhere to the presumption of innocence).

In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption of prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended, need not enter the box with empty heads in order to determine the facts impartially. “It is sufficient if the juror[s] can lay aside [their] impression[s] or opinion[s] and render a verdict  based on the evidence presented in court.” Irvin, 366 U.S., at 723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. Taking account of the full record, rather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from it, we find no cause to upset the lower courts' judgment that Skilling's jury met that measure. We therefore affirm the Fifth Circuit's ruling that Skilling received a fair trial.34 Our decisions have rightly set a high bar for allegations of juror prejudice due to pretrial publicity. See, e.g., Mu'Min, 500 U.S. 415, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493; Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975). News coverage of civil and criminal trials of public interest conveys to society at large how our justice system operates. And it is a premise of that system that jurors will set aside their preconceptions when they enter the courtroom and decide cases based on the evidence presented. Trial judges generally take care so to instruct jurors, and the District Court did just that in this case. App. 1026a.

 III 

We next consider whether Skilling's conspiracy conviction was premised on an improper theory of honest-services wire fraud. The honest-services statute, § 1346, Skilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alternatively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within the statute's compass.

 A 

To place Skilling's constitutional challenge in context, we first review the origin and subsequent application of the honest-services doctrine.

 1 

Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the predecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws, proscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to advance “any scheme or artifice to defraud.” See McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 356, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In 1909, Congress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today, “any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” § 1341 (emphasis added); see id., at 357-358, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Emphasizing Congress' disjunctive phrasing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.

In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangible-rights theory, Shushan v. United States, 117 F.2d 110 (1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecution of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial to the bribe payers. “It is not true that because the [city] was to make and did make a saving by the operations there could not have been an intent to defraud,” the Court of Appeals maintained. Id., at 119. “A scheme to get a public contract on more favorable terms than would likely be got otherwise by bribing a public official,” the court observed, “would not only be a plan to commit the crime of bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.” Id., at 115.

The Fifth Circuit's opinion in Shushan stimulated the development of an “honest-services” doctrine. Unlike fraud in which the victim's loss of money or property supplied the defendant's gain, with one the mirror image of the other, see, e.g.,United States v. Starr, 816 F.2d 94, 101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract, yet the contract terms were the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm's length, the city (the betrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. McNally, 483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that party's right to the offender's “honest services.” See, e.g., United States v. Dixon, 536 F.2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).

“ Most often these cases . . . involved bribery of public officials,” United States v. Bohonus, 628 F.2d 1167, 1171 (CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector honest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application of the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing a bribery scheme, explained:

“When one tampers with [the employer-employee] relationship for the purpose of causing the employee to breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is defrauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual deception that is practised is in the continued representation of the employee to the employer that he is honest and loyal to the employer's interests.” United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp. 676, 678 (Mass. 1942).

Over time, “[a]n increasing number of courts” recognized that “a recreant employee”--public or private--“c[ould] be prosecuted under [the mail-fraud statute] if he breache[d] his allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kickbacks in the course of his employment,” United States v. McNeive, 536 F.2d 1245, 1249 (CA8 1976); by 1982, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud, Hurson, Limiting the Federal Mail Fraud Statute--A Legislative Approach, 20 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 423, 456 (1983).35 In addition to upholding honest-services prosecutions, courts also increasingly approved use of the mail-fraud statute to attack corruption that deprived victims of other kinds of intangible rights, including election fraud and privacy violations. See, e.g.,Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 18, n. 2, 121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221 (2000); McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 362-364, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, and nn. 1-4 (1987) (Stevens, J., dissenting).

 2 

In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States, stopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in its tracks. McNally involved a state officer who, in selecting Kentucky's insurance agent, arranged to procure a share of the agent's commissions via kickbacks paid to companies the  official partially controlled. 483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. The prosecutor did not charge that, “in the absence of the alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance.” Ibid. Instead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback scheme “defraud[ed] the citizens and government of Kentucky of their right to have the Commonwealth's affairs conducted honestly.” Id., at 353, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292.

We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud. “Rather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials,” we read the statute “as limited in scope to the protection of property rights.” Id., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. “If Congress desires to go further,” we stated, “it must speak more clearly.” Ibid.

 3 

Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it enacted a new statute “specifically to cover one of the 'intangible rights' that lower courts had protected . . . prior to McNally: 'the intangible right of honest services.' Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 19-20, 121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221 (2000). In full, the honest-services statute stated:

 “For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United States Code that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, § 1341, and wire fraud, § 1343], the term 'scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.” § 1346.

 B 

Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not clearly: He asserts that § 1346 is unconstitutionally vague.  To satisfy due process, “a penal statute [must] define the criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory  enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these requirements.

According to Skilling, § 1346 meets neither of the two due process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible right of honest services,” he contends, does not adequately define what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38-39. Second, he alleges, § 1346's “standardless sweep . . . allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] opportunistic and arbitrary prosecutions.” Id., at 44 (quoting Kolender, 461 U.S., at 358, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903).

In urging invalidation of § 1346, Skilling swims against  our case law's current, which requires us, if we can, to construe, not condemn, Congress' enactments. See, e.g., Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 571, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1973). See also United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 32, 83 S. Ct. 594, 9 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1963) (stressing, in response to a vagueness challenge, “[t]he strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of Congress”). 

Alert to § 1346's potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute.36 Courts have disagreed about whether § 1346 prosecutions must be based on a violation of state law, compare, e.g.,United States v. Brumley, 116 F.3d 728, 734-735 (CA5 1997) (en banc), with, e.g., United States v. Weyhrauch, 548 F.3d 1237, 1245-1246 (CA9 2008), vacated and remanded, post, p. 476, 130 S. Ct. 2971, 177 L. Ed. 2d 705; whether a defendant must contemplate that the victim suffer economic harm, compare, e.g.,United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal., 138 F.3d 961, 973, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 149 (CADC 1998), with, e.g., United States v. Black, 530 F.3d 596, 600-602 (CA7 2008), vacated and remanded, post, p. 465, 130 S. Ct. 2963, 177 L. Ed. 2d 695; and whether the defendant must act in pursuit of private gain, compare, e.g.,United States v. Bloom, 149 F.3d 649, 655 (CA7 1998), with, e.g., United States v. Panarella, 277 F.3d 678, 692 (CA3 2002). Uniformly, however, they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague.37 See, e.g., United States v. Rybicki, 354 F.3d 124, 132 (CA2 2003) (en banc); United States v. Hausmann, 345 F.3d 952, 958 (CA7 2003); United States v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081, 1109, n. 29 (CA10 2003); United States v. Frega, 179 F.3d 793, 803 (CA9 1999); Brumley, 116 F.3d at, 732-733; United States v. Frost, 125 F.3d 346, 370-372 (CA6 1997); United States v. Waymer, 55 F.3d 564, 568-569 (CA11 1995); United States v. Bryan, 58 F.3d 933, 941 (CA4 1995).

 We agree that § 1346 should be construed rather than invalidated. First, we look to the doctrine developed in pre-McNally cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase “the intangible right of honest services.” Second, to preserve what Congress certainly intended the statute to cover, we pare that body of precedent down to its core: In the main, the pre-McNally cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived. Confined to these paramount applications, § 1346 presents no vagueness problem.

 1 

There is no doubt that Congress intended § 1346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized in Courts of Appeals' decisions before McNally derailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud. See Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for United States 37-38; post, at 416, 422, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665, 668 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Congress enacted § 1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the statute using that decision's terminology. See 483 U.S., at 355, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (“intangible righ[t]”); id., at 362, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (“right to . . . honest services”).38 Although verbal formulations varied slightly, the words employed by the Courts of Appeals prior to McNally described the same concept: “honest services,” e.g., United States v. Bruno, 809 F.2d 1097, 1105 (CA5 1987); “honest and faithful services,” e.g., United States v. Brown, 540 F.2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); and “faithful and honest services,” e.g., United States v. Diggs, 613 F.2d 988, 998, 198 U.S. App. D.C. 255 (CADC 1979). As the Second Circuit observed in its leading analysis of § 1346:

 “The definite article 'the' suggests that 'intangible right of honest services' had a specific meaning to Congress when it enacted the statute--Congress was recriminalizing mail- and wire-fraud schemes to deprive others  of that 'intangible right of honest services,' which had been protected before McNally, not all intangible rights of honest services whatever they might be thought to be.” United States v. Rybicki, 354 F.3d 124, 137-138 (2003) (en banc).39 We considered a similar Court-Congress interplay in McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Wilander, 498 U.S. 337, 111 S. Ct. 807, 112 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1991), which involved the interpretation of the term “seaman” in the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. App. § 688 (2000 ed.). The Act, we recognized, “respond[ed] directly to” our decision in The Osceola, 189 U.S. 158, 23 S. Ct. 483, 47 L. Ed. 760 (1903), and “adopt[ed] without further elaboration the term used in” that case, so we “assume[d] that the Jones Act use[d] 'seaman' in the same way.” 498 U.S., at 342, 111 S. Ct. 807, 112 L. Ed. 2d 866.

 2 

Satisfied that  Congress, by enacting § 1346, “meant to reinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law,” post, at 422, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 668 (opinion of Scalia, J.), we have surveyed that case law. See infra, at 407-408, 410, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659-660, 661. In parsing the Courts of Appeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling's vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions preceding McNally were not models of clarity or consistency. See Brief for Petitioner 39-42 (describing divisions of opinions). See also post, at 417-420, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665-667 (opinion of Scalia, J.). While the honest-services cases preceding McNally dominantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to bribery and kickback schemes--schemes that were the basis of most honest-services prosecutions--there was considerable disarray over the statute's application to conduct outside that core category. In light of this disarray, Skilling urges us, as he urged the Fifth Circuit, to invalidate the statute in toto. Brief for Petitioner 48 (Section 1346“is intolerably and unconstitutionally vague.”); Brief for Defendant-Appellant Skilling in No. 06-20885 (CA5), p. 65, n. 21 (“[S]ection 1346 should be invalidated as unlawfully vague on its face.”).

 It has long been our practice, however, before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction. See, e.g., Hooper v. California, 155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S. Ct. 207, 39 L. Ed. 297 (1895) (“The elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.” (emphasis added)). See also Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 330-331, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1988); Schneider v. Smith, 390 U.S. 17, 26, 88 S. Ct. 682, 19 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1968).40 “This cardinal principle has its roots in Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court in Murray v. The Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. 64, 2 Cranch 64, 118, 2 L. Ed. 208 (1804), and has for so long been applied by this Court that it is beyond debate.” Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1392, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1988). See, e.g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113 (1982); NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U.S. 490, 500-501, 99 S.

Ct. 1784, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1141 (1961); United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 45, 73 S. Ct. 543, 97 L. Ed. 770 (1953); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 517, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L.

Ed. 836 (1909); United States v. Coombs, 37 U.S. 72, 12 Pet. 72, 76, 9 L. Ed. 1004 (1838) (Story, J.); Parsons v. Bedford, 28 U.S. 433, 3 Pet. 433, 448-449, 7 L. Ed. 732 (1830) (Story, J.). Cf. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 569, 573, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942)(statute made it criminal to address “any offensive, derisive or annoying word” to any person in a public place; vagueness obviated by state-court construction of the statute to cover only words having “a direct tendency to cause acts of violence” by the addressee (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have accordingly instructed “the federal courts . . . to avoid constitutional difficulties by [adopting a limiting interpretation] if such a construction is fairly possible.” Boos, 485 U.S., at 331, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333; see United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 618, 74 S. Ct. 808, 98 L. Ed. 989 (1954) (“[I]f the general class of offenses to which the statute is directed is plainly within its terms, the statute will not be struck down as vague . . . . And if this general class of offenses can be made constitutionally definite by a reasonable construction of the statute, this Court is under a duty to give the statute that construction.”).

Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core; “the pre-McNally caselaw,” he asserts, “is a  hodgepodge of oft-conflicting holdings” that are “hopelessly unclear.” Brief for Petitioner 39 (some capitalization and italics omitted). We have rejected an argument of the same tenor before. In Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers, federal employees challenged a provision of the Hatch Act that incorporated earlier decisions of the United States Civil Service Commission enforcing a similar law. “[T]he several thousand adjudications of the Civil Service Commission,” the employees maintained, were “an impenetrable jungle”--“undiscoverable, inconsistent, [and] incapable of yielding any meaningful rules to govern present or future conduct.” 413 U.S., at 571, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796. Mindful that “our task [wa]s not to destroy the Act if we c[ould], but to construe it,” we held that “the rules that had evolved over the years from repeated adjudications were subject to sufficiently clear and summary statement.” Id., at 571-572, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796.

A similar observation may be made here. Although some applications of the pre-McNally honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these cases do not cloud the doctrine's solid core:  The “vast majority” of the honest-services cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. United States v. Runnels, 833 F.2d 1183, 1187 (CA6 1987); see Brief for United States 42, and n. 4 (citing dozens of examples).41 Justice Scalia emphasizes divisions in the Courts of Appeals regarding the source and scope of fiduciary duties. Post, at 417-419, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665-667. But these debates were rare in bribe and kickback cases. The existence of a fiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually beyond dispute; examples include public official-public, see, e.g., United States v. Mandel, 591 F.2d 1347 (CA4 1979); employee-employer, see, e.g., United States v. Bohonus, 628 F.2d 1167 (CA9 1980); and union official-union members, see, e.g., United States v. Price, 788 F.2d 234 (CA4 1986). See generally Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 233, 100 S. Ct. 1108, 63 L. Ed. 2d 348 (1980) (noting the “established doctrine that [a fiduciary] duty arises from a specific relationship between two parties”). Indeed, the McNally case itself, which spurred Congress to enact § 1346, presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U.S., at 352-353, 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292.  Congress' reversal of McNally and reinstatement of the honest-services doctrine, we conclude, can and should be salvaged by confining its scope to the core pre-McNally applications.

As already noted, supra, at 400-401, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 668, the honest-services doctrine had its genesis in prosecutions involving bribery allegations. See Shushan, 117 F.2d at 115 (public sector); Procter & Gamble Co., 47 F. Supp., at 678 (private sector). See also United States v. Orsburn, 525 F.3d 543, 546 (CA7 2008). Both before McNally and after § 1346's enactment, Courts of Appeals described schemes involving bribes or kickbacks as “core . . . honest services fraud precedents,” United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1077 (CA1 1997); “paradigm case[s],” United States v. deVegter, 198 F.3d 1324, 1327-1328 (CA11 1999); “[t]he most obvious form of honest services fraud,” United States v. Carbo, 572 F.3d 112, 115 (CA3 2009); “core misconduct covered by the statute,” United States v. Urciuoli, 513 F.3d 290, 294 (CA1 2008); “most [of the] honest services cases,” United States v. Sorich, 523 F.3d 702, 707 (CA7 2008); “typical,” United States v. Brown, 540 F.2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); “clear-cut,” United States v. Mandel, 591 F.2d 1347, 1363 (CA4 1979); and “uniformly . . . cover[ed],” United States v. Paradies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1283, n. 30 (CA11 1996). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (counsel for the Government) (“[T]he bulk of pre-McNally honest services cases” entailed bribes or kickbacks); Brief for Petitioner 49 (“Bribes and kickbacks were the paradigm [pre-McNally] cases,” constituting “[t]he overwhelming majority of prosecutions for honest-services fraud.”).

In view of this history, there is no doubt that  Congress intended § 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks. Reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct, we acknowledge, would raise the due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine.42 Apprised that a broader reading of § 1346 could render the statute impermissibly vague, Congress, we believe, would have drawn the honest-services line, as we do now, at bribery and kickback schemes. Cf. Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.S. 413, 427, 130 S. Ct. 2323, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1131, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 4380 (2010)“[C]ourts may attempt . . . to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.”); United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 246, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005) (“We seek to determine what 'Congress would have intended' in light of the Court's constitutional holding.”). To preserve the  statute without transgressing constitutional limitations, we now hold that § 1346 criminalizes only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.43 Justice Scalia charges that our construction of § 1346 is “not interpretation but invention.” Post, at 422, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 668. Stating that he “know[s] of no precedent for . . . 'paring down' ” the pre-McNally case law to its core, Post at 422, he contends that the Court today “wield[s] a power we long ago abjured: the power to define new federal crimes,” post, at 415, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 664. See also, e.g., post, at 422, 423, 424, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 669, 669, 670. As noted supra, at 405-406, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 658-659, and n. 40, cases “paring down” federal statutes to avoid constitutional shoals are legion. These cases recognize that the Court does not legislate, but instead respects the legislature, by preserving a statute through a limiting interpretation. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 267-268, n. 6, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997) (This Court does not “create a common law crime” by adopting a “narrow[ing] constru[ction].” (internal quotation marks omitted)); supra, at 408, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 660 and this page, n. 42. Given that the Courts of Appeals uniformly recognized bribery and kickback schemes as honest-services fraud before McNally, 483 U.S. 350, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, and that these schemes composed the lion's share of honest-services cases, limiting § 1346 to these heartland applications is surely “fairly possible.” Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 331, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1988); cf. Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 380, 125 S. Ct. 716, 160 L. Ed. 2d 734 (2005) (opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.) (when adopting a limiting construction, “[t]he lowest common denominator, as it were, must govern”). So construed, the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. See infra, at 412-413, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 662-663; post, at 421, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 668. Only by taking a wrecking ball to a statute that can be salvaged through a reasonable narrowing interpretation would we act out of step with precedent.

The Government urges us to go further by locating within § 1346's compass another category of proscribed conduct: “undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee--i.e., the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.” Brief for United States 43-44. “[T]he  theory of liability in McNally itself was nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest,” the Government observes, and “Congress clearly intended to revive th[at] nondisclosure theory.” Id., at 44. Moreover, “[a]lthough not as numerous as the bribery and kickback cases,” the Government asserts, “the pre-McNally cases involving undisclosed self-dealing were abundant.” Ibid.

Neither of these contentions withstands close inspection. McNally, as we have already observed, supra, at 401-402, 407, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 656, 659, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public official, in exchange for routing Kentucky's insurance business through a middleman company, arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official held an interest. 483 U.S., at 352-353, 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. This was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest; rather, the official conspired with a third party so that both would profit from wealth generated by public contracts. See id., at 352-353, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Reading § 1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks--and nothing more--satisfies Congress' undoubted aim to reverse McNallyon its facts.

Nor are we persuaded that the pre-McNally conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld honest-services convictions for “some schemes of non-disclosure and concealment of material information,” Mandel, 591 F.2d at 1361, they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. In light of the relative infrequency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to bribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable limiting construction of § 1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.

Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar principle that “ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.” Cleveland, 531 U.S., at 25, 121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221 (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S. Ct. 1056, 28 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1971)). “This interpretive guide is especially appropriate in construing [ § 1346] because . . . mail [and wire] fraud [are] predicate offense[s] under [the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act], 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) (1994 ed., Supp. IV), and the money laundering statute, § 1956(c)(7)(A).” Cleveland, 531 U.S.,  at 25, 121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221. Holding that honest-services fraud does not encompass conduct more wide ranging than the paradigmatic cases of bribes and kickbacks, we resist the Government's less constrained construction absent Congress' clear instruction otherwise. E.g.,United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221-222, 73 S. Ct. 227, 97 L. Ed. 260 (1952).

In sum, our construction of § 1346 “establish[es] a uniform national standard, define[s] honest services with clarity, reach[es] only seriously culpable conduct, and accomplish[es] Congress's goal of 'overruling' McNally.” Brief for Albert W. Alschuler as Amicus Curiae in Weyhrauch v. United States, O. T. 2009, No. 08-1196, pp. 28-29. “If Congress desires to go further,” we reiterate, “it must speak more clearly than it has.” McNally, 483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292.44 If Congress were to take up the enterprise of criminalizing “undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee,” Brief for United States 43, it would have to employ standards of sufficient definiteness and specificity to overcome due process concerns. The Government proposes a standard that prohibits the “taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty,” so long as the employee acts with a specific intent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim to change its behavior. Id., at 43-44. See also id., at 40-41. That formulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct or significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To what extent does the official action have to further that interest in order to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made, and what information should it convey? These questions and others call for particular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohibition in this context.

  4 

Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes, § 1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. Recall that the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns about (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions. See Kolender, 461 U.S., at 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903. A prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of one's honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks does not present a problem on either score.

As to fair notice, “whatever the school of thought concerning the scope and meaning of ” § 1346, it has always been “as plain as a pikestaff that” bribes and kickbacks constitute honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 101, 71 S. Ct. 576, 95 L. Ed. 774 (1951), and the statute's mens rea requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, e.g., Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101-104, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945) (plurality opinion). See also Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 608, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973) (“[E]ven if the outermost boundaries of [a statute are] imprecise, any such uncertainty has little relevance . . . where appellants' conduct falls squarely within the 'hard core' of the statute's proscriptions.”). Today's decision clarifies that no other misconduct falls within § 1346's province. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997) (“[C]larity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute.”).

As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant risk that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it today, will be stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-McNally case law, but also from federal statutes proscribing--and defining--similar crimes. See, e.g.,18 U.S.C. §§ 201(b), 666(a)(2); 41 U.S.C. § 52(2)(“The term 'kickback' means any money, fee, commission, credit, gift, gratuity, thing of value, or compensation of any kind which is provided, directly or indirectly, to [enumerated persons] for the purpose of improperly obtaining or rewarding favorable  treatment in connection with [enumerated circumstances].”).45 Overlap with other federal statutes does not render § 1346 superfluous. The principal federal bribery statute, § 201, for example, generally applies only to federal public officials, so § 1346's application to state and local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct that might otherwise go unpunished. See also, e.g., United States v. Ganim, 510 F.3d 134, 147-149 (CA2 2007) (Sotomayor, J.) (reviewing honest-services conviction involving bribery in light of elements of bribery under other federal statutes); United States v. Whitfield, 590 F.3d 325, 352-353 (CA5 2009); United States v. Kemp, 500 F.3d 257, 281-286 (CA3 2007). A criminal defendant who participated in a bribery or kickback scheme, in short, cannot tenably complain about prosecution under § 1346 on vagueness grounds.

 C 

It remains to determine whether Skilling's conduct violated § 1346. Skilling's honest-services prosecution, the Government concedes, was not “prototypical.” Brief for United States 49. The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enron's shareholders by misrepresenting the company's fiscal health, thereby artificially inflating its stock price. It was the Government's theory at trial that Skilling “profited from the fraudulent scheme . . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and through the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron stock, which netted him $89 million.” Id., at 51.

The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations. See Record 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government to the District Court) (“[T]he indictment does not allege, and the government's evidence did not show, that [Skilling] engaged in bribery.”). It is therefore clear that, as we read § 1346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.

 Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy--honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud--Skilling's conviction is flawed. See Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298, 77 S. Ct. 1064, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1957) (constitutional error occurs when a jury is instructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a general verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory). This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently confirmed, in Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U.S. 57, 129 S. Ct. 530, 172 L. Ed. 2d 388 (2008)(per curiam), that errors of the Yates variety are subject to harmless-error analysis. The parties vigorously dispute whether the error was harmless. Compare Brief for United States 52 (“[A]ny juror who voted for conviction based on [the honest-services theory] also would have found [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities fraud.”) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government “cannot show that the conspiracy conviction rested only on the securities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally-flawed honest-services theory.”). We leave this dispute for resolution on remand.46The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, “if any of the three objects of Skilling's conspiracy offers a legally insufficient theory,” it “must set aside his conviction.” 554 F.3d at, 543. That reasoning relied on the mistaken premise that Hedgpeth v. Pulido, 555 U.S. 57, 129 S. Ct. 530, 172 L. Ed. 2d 388 (2008)(per curiam), governs only cases on collateral review. See 554 F.3d at, 543, n. 10. Harmless-error analysis, we clarify, applies equally to cases on direct appeal. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit, on remand, should take a fresh look at the parties' harmless-error arguments.

Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count touches any of Skilling's other convictions is also an open question. All of his convictions, Skilling contends, hinged on the conspiracy count and, like dominoes, must fall if it falls. The District Court, deciding Skilling's motion for bail pending appeal, found this argument dubious, App. 1141a-1142a, but the Fifth Circuit had no occasion to rule on it. That court may do so on remand.

 * * * 

For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Fifth Circuit's ruling on Skilling's fair-trial argument, vacate its ruling on his conspiracy conviction, and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

Frank G. Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in an Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted murders.  He was sentenced to death.  He filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitutional errors occurred at his trial.  First, Spisak claimed that the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation only those factors that the jury unanimously found to be mitigating.  See Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (1988).  Second, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm as a result of his counsel's inadequate closing argument at the penalty phase of the proceeding.  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). The Federal Court of Appeals accepted these arguments  and ordered habeas relief.  We now reverse the Court of Appeals. 

I 

In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders and two attempted murders at Cleveland State University in 1982.  The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a death sentence.  The Ohio courts denied Spisak's claims, both on direct appeal and on collateral review.  State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N.E.2d 800 (1988)(per curiam); State v. Spisak, No. 67229, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 1567, 1995 WL 229108 (Ohio App., 8th Dist., Cuyahoga Cty., Apr. 13, 1995); State v. Spisak, 73 Ohio St. 3d 151, 1995 Ohio 4, 652 N.E.2d 719 (1995)(per curiam).

Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.  Among other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase of his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two reasons we consider here.  The District Court denied his petition.  Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio, Apr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a.  But the Court of Appeals accepted Spisak's two claims, namely, his mitigation instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F.3d 684, 703-706, 708-711 (CA6 2006).  The Court of Appeals consequently ordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of habeas corpus forbidding Spisak's execution.  Id., at 715-716. 

The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.  We granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment. Hudson v. Spisak, 552 U.S. 945, 128 S. Ct. 373, 169 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2007).  We remanded the case for further consideration in light of two recent cases in which this Court had held that lower federal courts had not properly taken account of the deference federal law grants state-court determinations on federal habeas review. Ibid.; see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d); Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.S. 70, 127 S. Ct. 649, 166 L. Ed. 2d 482 (2006); Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007).  On remand, the Sixth Circuit reinstated its earlier  opinion.  Spisak v. Hudson, 512 F.3d 852, 853-854 (2008).  The State again sought certiorari.  We again granted the petition.  And we now reverse. 

II 

Spisak's first claim concerns the instructions and verdict forms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his trial.  The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instructions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instructions, taken together with the forms, "require[d]" juror "unanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor"--contrary to this Court's holding in Spisak v. Mitchell, supra.465 F.3d, at 708.   Since the parties do not dispute that the Ohio courts "adjudicated" this claim, i.e., they considered and rejected it "on the merits," the law permits a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the state-court decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States."  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).  Unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Spisak's claim does not satisfy this standard. 

The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that Mills sets forth the pertinent "clearly established Federal law."  While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether Mills was "clearly established Federal law" for the purpose of reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court's opinion, we shall assume the same.  Compare Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 390, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000) (Stevens, J., for the Court) (applicable date for purposes of determining whether "Federal law" is "established" is when the "state-court conviction became final"), with id., at 412, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (O'Connor, J., for the Court) (applicable date is "the time of the relevant state-court decision"); see State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N.E.2d 800(decided Apr. 13, 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 1354, 103 L. Ed. 2d 822 (decided Mar. 6, 1989); Mills v. Maryland, supra (decided June 6, 1988). 

 A 

The rule the Court set forth in Mills is based on two well-established principles.  First,  the Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or jury is "'"precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death."'" 486 U.S., at 374, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982), in turn quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion)).  Second,  the sentencing judge or jury "'may not refuse to consider or be precluded from considering "any relevant mitigating evidence."'" Mills, 486 U.S., at 374-375, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (quoting Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4, 106 S. Ct. 1669, 90 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986), in turn quoting Eddings, supra, at 114, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1). 

Applying these principles,  the Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist.  Mills, 486 U.S., at 380-381, 384, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384.  If, for example, the defense presents evidence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some jurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some only the second, and some only the third.  But if even one of the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating considerations exists, but that he is barred from considering it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held, the Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.  See id., at 380, 384, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384; see also McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 442-443, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990) ("Mills requires that each juror be permitted to consider and give effect to . . . all mitigating evidence in deciding . . . whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances . . . ").  Because the instructions in Mills would have led a reasonable juror to believe the contrary,  the Court held that the sentencing proceeding violated the Constitution.486 U.S., at 374-375, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384. 

B 

In evaluating the Court of Appeals' determination here, we have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in Mills and compared them with those used in the present case.  In the Mills sentencing phase, the trial judge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had three distinct parts.  Section I set forth a list of 10 specific aggravating circumstances next to which were spaces where the jury was to mark "yes" or "no."  Just above the list, the form said: "Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that each of the following aggravating circumstances which is marked 'yes' has been proven . . . and each aggravating circumstance which is marked 'no' has not been proven . . . ." Id., at 384-385, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).

Section II set forth a list of eight potentially mitigating circumstances (seven specific circumstances and the eighth designated as "other") next to which were spaces where the jury was to mark "yes" or "no."  Just above the list the form said: "Based upon the evidence we unanimously find that each of the following mitigating circumstances which is marked 'yes' has been proven to exist . . . and each mitigating circumstance marked 'no' has not been proven . . . ."  Id., at 387, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).

 Section III set forth the overall balancing question, along with spaces for the jury to mark "yes" or "no."  It said: "Based on the evidence we unanimously find that it has been proven . . . that the mitigating circumstances marked 'yes' in Section II outweigh the aggravating circumstances marked 'yes' in Section I."  Id., at 388-389, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).

Explaining the forms, the judge instructed the jury with an example.  He told the jury that it should mark "'yes'" on the jury form if it "'unanimously'" concluded that an aggravating circumstance had been proved. Id., at 378, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384.  Otherwise, he said, "'of course you must answer no.'"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  These instructions, together with the forms, told the jury to mark "yes" on Section II's list of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously concluded that the particular mitigating factor had been proved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section III only those mitigating factors marked "yes" in Section II.  Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that it could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors that the jury had unanimously found to exist.  See id., at 380-381, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384. 

The instructions and jury forms in this case differ significantly from those inMills. The trial judge instructed the jury that the aggravating factors it would consider were the specifications that the jury had found proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial--essentially, that each murder was committed in a course of conduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the murders, that the murder was committed with the intent to evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.  8 Tr. 2967-2972 (July 19, 1983). 

He then explained the concept of a "mitigating factor."  After doing so, he listed examples, including that "the defendant because of a mental disease or defect . . . lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law."  Id., at 2972-2973.  The court also told the jury that it could take account of "any other" mitigating consideration it found "relevant to the issue of whether the defendant  should be sentenced to death."  Id., at 2973.  And he instructed the jury that the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.  Id., at 2965. 

With respect to "the procedure" by which the jury should reach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following: "[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.  From this you must determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case. "If all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance in each separate count outweighs the mitigating factors, then you must return that finding to the Court. . . . . . "On the other hand, if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts outweigh the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court."  Id., at 2973-2975.

The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each aggravating factor.  The first of the two forms said: "'We the jury in this case . . . do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance . . . was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.  "'We the jury recommend that the sentence of death be imposed . . . .'"  Id., at 2975-2976.

The other verdict form read: "'We the jury . . . do find that the aggravating circumstances . . . are not sufficient to outweigh the mitigation factors present in this case. "'We the jury recommend that the defendant . . . be sentenced to life imprisonment . . . .'"  Id., at 2976.

The instructions and forms made clear that, to recommend a death sentence, the jury had to find, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances.  But the instructions did not say that the jury must determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.  Neither the instructions nor the forms said anything about how--or even whether--the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.  They focused only on the overall balancing question.  And the instructions repeatedly told the jury to "conside[r] all of the relevant evidence."  Id., at 2974.  In our view the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly bring about, either through what they said or what they implied, the circumstance that Mills found critical, namely, "a substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon receiving the judge's instructions in this case, and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance."  486 U.S., at 384, 108 S. Ct. 1860, 100 L. Ed. 2d 384.

We consequently conclude that the state court's decision upholding these forms and instructions was not "contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal  law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States" in Mills.28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). 

We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that the instructions "require[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives."  465 F.3d, at 709 (citing Mapes v. Coyle, 171 F.3d 408, 416-417 (CA6 1999)).  We have not, however, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason. Mills says nothing about the matter.  Neither the parties nor the courts below referred to Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980), or identified any other precedent from this Court setting forth this rule.  Cf. Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 379-384, 119 S. Ct. 2090, 144 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1999) (rejecting an arguably analogous claim).  But see post, at ____ - ____, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 609-610 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Whatever the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict forms in this case were we to consider them on direct appeal, the jury instructions at Spisak's trial were not contrary to "clearly established Federal law."  28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). 

III 

Spisak's second claim is that his counsel's closing argument at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inadequate as to violate the Sixth Amendment.   To prevail, Spisak must show both that "counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness," Strickland, 466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, and that there is a "reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different," id., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. 

The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak's claim was "not well-taken on the basis of our review of the record."  State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N.E.2d, at 802 (citing, inter alia, Strickland, supra). The District Court concluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job and that "[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability that, absent  counsel's alleged errors, the jury would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death."  Spisak v. Coyle, Case No. 1:95 CV 2675 (ND Ohio, Apr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 204a.  The Court of Appeals, however, reached a contrary conclusion.  It held that counsel's closing argument, measured by "'an objective standard of reasonableness,'" was inadequate, and it asserted that "a reasonable probability exists" that adequate representation would have led to a different result. Spisak v. Mitchell, 465 F.3d, at 703, 706 (quoting Strickland, supra, at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674).  Responding to the State's petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the Court of Appeals' terse finding of a "reasonable probability" that a more adequate argument would have changed a juror's vote. 

In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak's counsel described Spisak's killings in some detail.  He acknowledged that Spisak's admiration for Hitler inspired his crimes.  He portrayed Spisak as "sick," "twisted," and "demented."  8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983).  And he said that Spisak was "never going to be any different."  Ibid.  He then pointed out that all the experts had testified that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.  And, after a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his own decisions about calling expert witnesses and preparing them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not legally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently mentally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he should not be executed.  Counsel also told the jury that, when weighing Spisak's mental illness against the "substantial" aggravating factors present in the case, id., at 2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of "pride" for living in "a humane society" made up of "a humane people," id., at 2897-2900, 2926-2928.  That humanity, he said, required the jury to weigh the evidence "fairly" and to be "loyal to that oath" the jurors had taken to uphold the law.  Id., at 2926. 

 Spisak and his supporting amici say that this argument was constitutionally inadequate because:  (1) It overly emphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it overly emphasized Spisak's threats to continue his crimes; (3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based their mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing about any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5) it made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict against death. 

We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct that the closing argument was inadequate.  We nevertheless find no "reasonable probability" that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference. 

Any different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context:  Spisak admitted that he had committed three murders and two other shootings.  Spisak's defense at the guilt phase of the trial consisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.  And counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate Spisak's mentally defective condition, called him to the stand. 

Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace Rickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford.  He also admitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Hardaway, and shot at Coletta Dartt.  He committed these crimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler, who was Spisak's "spiritual leader" in a "war" for "survival" of "the Aryan people."  4 id., at 1343-1344, 1396 (July 5, 1983).  He said that he had purchased guns and stockpiled ammunition to further this war.  Id., at 1406-1408.  And he had hoped to "create terror" at Cleveland State University, because it was "one of the prime targets" where the "Jews and the system . . . are brainwashing the youth."  Id., at 1426-1428. 

Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot Rickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a sexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom.  He expressed  satisfaction at having "eliminated that particular threat . . . to me and to the white race."  5 id., at 1511 (July 7, 1983).  In June he saw a stranger, John Hardaway, on a train platform and shot him seven times because he had been looking for a black person to kill as "blood atonement" for a recent crime against two white women.  4 id., at 1416 (July 5, 1983).  He added that he felt "good" after shooting Hardaway because he had "accomplished something," but later felt "[k]ind of bad" when he learned that Hardaway had survived.  Id., at 1424-1425.  In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt because, he said, he heard her "making some derisive remarks about us," meaning the Nazi Party.  Id., at 1432-1435.  Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy Sheehan because he "thought he was one of those Jewish professors . . . that liked to hang around in the men's room and seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that go there."  5 id., at 1465-1466 (July 7, 1983).  Spisak added that he was "sorry about that" murder because he later learned Sheehan "wasn't Jewish like I thought he was."  Ibid.  And three days later, while on a "search and destroy mission," he shot and killed Brian Warford, a young black man who "looked like he was almost asleep" in a bus shelter, to fulfill his "duty" to "inflict the maximum amount of casualties on the enemies."  Id., at 1454-1455, 1478. 

Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit similar crimes if he had the chance.  He said about Warford's murder that he "didn't want to get caught that time because I wanted to be able to do it again and again and again and again."  Id., at 1699 (July 8, 1983).  In a letter written to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and Warford "the finest thing I ever did in my whole life" and expressed a wish that he "had a human submachine gun right now so I could exterminate" black men "and watch them scream and twitch in agony."  Id., at 1724-1725.  And he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would escape from jail, "go out and continue the war I started," and "continue to inflict the maximum  amount of damage on the enemies as I am able to do."  Id., at 1780-1781. 

The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak was lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives for these crimes.  The State contended instead that the shootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such as robbery.  See id., at 1680, 1816-1818. 

The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused to instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded expert testimony regarding Spisak's mental state.  The defense's expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a report diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a "schizotypal personality disorder" and an "atypical psychotic disorder," and as, at times, "unable to control his impulses to assault."  6 id., at 1882-1883, 1992 (July 11, 1983).  His testimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a voir dire, however.  On cross-examination, he conceded that he could not say Spisak failed Ohio's sanity standard at the time of the murders.  After Markey made the same concession before the jury, the court granted the prosecution's renewed motion to exclude Markey's testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.  And the court excluded the defense's proffered reports from other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined Spisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met the Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes.  Id., at 1898-1899, 1911-1912, 1995; id., at 2017, 2022 (July 12, 1983). 

During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense counsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.  Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that Spisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personality disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid thinking, gender identification conflict, and emotional instability.  She added that these defects "substantially impair his ability to  conform himself" to the law's requirements.  8 id., at 2428-2429, 2430-2441 (July 16, 1983).  Dr. Kurt Bertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered from a schizotypal personality disorder and that "mental illness does impair his reason to the extent that he has substantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial inability to refrain."  Id., at 2552-2556.  Dr. Markey, whose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase, again testified and agreed with the other experts' diagnoses.  Id., at 2692-2693, 2712-2713 (July 18, 1983). 

In light of this background and for the following reasons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in defense counsel's closing argument raise "a reasonable probability that," but for the deficient closing, "the result of the proceeding would have been different."  Strickland, 466 U.S., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.  We therefore cannot find the Ohio Supreme Court's decision rejecting Spisak's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim to be an "unreasonable application" of the law "clearly established" in Strickland.§ 2254(d)(1). 

First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately following the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds the government's evidence regarding the killings--which included photographs of the dead bodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel's vivid descriptions of the crimes--as well as Spisak's boastful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit further acts of violence.  We therefore do not see how a less descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging comments about Spisak could have made a significant difference. 

Similarly fresh in the jurors' minds was the three defense experts' testimony that Spisak suffered from mental illness.  The jury had heard the experts explain the specific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as well as what they had learned of his family background and his struggles with gender identity.  And the jury had heard the experts draw connections between his mental illness and the crimes.   We do not see how it could have made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his actual argument--which emphasized mental illness as a mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts' testimony--by repeating the facts or connections that the experts had just described. 

Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned.  All those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the "mental defect" factor that the defense experts described. 

Finally, in light of counsel's several appeals to the jurors' sense of humanity--he used the words "humane people" and "humane society" 10 times at various points in the argument--we cannot find that a more explicit or more elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result, either alone or together with the other circumstances just discussed.  Thus, we conclude that there is not a reasonable probability that a more adequate closing argument would have changed the result, and that the Ohio Supreme Court's rejection of Spisak's claim was not "contrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of" Strickland.28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). 

Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review under § 2254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because the Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the question whether counsel's closing argument caused Spisak prejudice.  That is, the Ohio Supreme Court's summary rejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court rested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was not ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not have made a difference, or (3) both.  See State v. Spisak, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N.E.2d, at 802.  Spisak argues that, under these circumstances, a federal court should not defer to a state court that may not have decided a question, but instead should decide the matter afresh.  Lower federal courts have rejected arguments similar to Spisak's.  See, e.g., Hennon v. Cooper, 109 F.3d 330, 334-335 (CA7 1997); see also Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.S. 225, 231, 237, 120 S. Ct. 727, 145 L. Ed. 2d 727 (2000) (applying the § 2254(d) standard in case involving a state court's summary denial of a claim, though not a Strickland claim, and without full briefing regarding whether or how § 2254(d) applied to a summary decision); Chadwick v. Janecka, 312 F.3d 597, 605-606 (CA3 2002) (Alito, J.) (relying on Weeks in holding that § 2254(d) applies where a state court denies a claim on the merits without giving any indication how it reached its decision); see generally 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure § 32.2, pp 1574-1579 (5th ed. 2005 and 2008 Supp.).  However, we need not decide whether deference under § 2254(d)(1) is required here.  With or without such deference, our conclusion is the same. 

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

The Federal Power Act (FPA or Act), 41 Stat. 1063, as amended, 16 U.S.C. § 791a et seq., authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) to superintend the sale of electricity in interstate commerce and provides that all wholesale-electricity rates must be "just and reasonable," § 824d(a).  Under this Court's Mobile-Sierra doctrine, FERC must presume that a rate set by "a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract" meets the statutory "just and reasonable" requirement.  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1, 554 U.S. 527, 530, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 2737, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607, 612 (2008)).  "The presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest."  Ibid.

This case stems from New England's difficulties in maintaining the reliability of its energy grid.  In 2006, after several attempts by the Commission and concerned parties to  address the problems, FERC approved a comprehensive settlement agreement (hereinafter Settlement Agreement or Agreement).  Most relevant here, the Agreement established rate-setting mechanisms for sales of energy capacity, and provided that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard would govern rate challenges.  Parties who opposed the settlement petitioned for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit.  Among multiple objections to FERC's order approving the Agreement, the settlement opponents urged that the rate challenges of nonsettling parties should not be controlled by the restrictive Mobile-Sierra public interest standard.  The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that "when a rate challenge is brought by a non-contracting third party, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine simply does not apply."  Maine Pub. Util. Comm'n v. FERC, 520 F.3d 464, 478, 380 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (2008)(per curiam).

We reverse the D. C. Circuit's judgment to the extent that it rejects the application of Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties.  Our decision in Morgan Stanley, announced three months after the D. C. Circuit's disposition, made clear that the Mobile-Sierra public interest standard is not an exception to the statutory just-and-reasonable standard; it is an application of that standard in the context of rates set by contract.  The "venerable Mobile-Sierra doctrine" rests on "the stabilizing force of contracts."  Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S., at 548, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607; see id., at 551, 128 S. Ct. at 2749, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 625 (describing contract rates as "a key source of stability").  To retain vitality, the doctrine must control FERC itself, and, we hold, challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting as well as contracting parties. 

I 

In a capacity market, in contrast to a wholesale-energy market, an electricity provider purchases from a generator an option to buy a quantity of energy, rather than purchasing the energy itself.  To maintain the reliability of the grid,  electricity providers generally purchase more capacity, i.e., rights to acquire energy, than necessary to meet their customers' anticipated demand.  For many years in New England, the supply of capacity was barely sufficient to meet the region's demand.  FERC and New England's generators, electricity providers, and power customers made several attempts to address this problem.  This case stems from the latest effort to design a solution. 

In 2003, a group of generators sought to enter into "reliability must-run" agreements with the New England Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates the region's transmission system.1An ISO is an independent company that has operational control, but not ownership, of the transmission facilities owned by member utilities.  ISOs "provide open access to the regional transmission system to all electricity generators at rates established in a single, unbundled, grid-wide tariff . . . ."  Midwest ISO Transmission Owners v. FERC, 373 F.3d 1361, 1364, 362 U.S. App. D.C. 314 (CADC 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In its orders addressing those agreements, FERC directed the ISO to develop a new market mechanism that would set prices separately for various geographical subregions.  Devon Power LLC, 103 FERC P61,082, pp. 61,266, 61,271 (2003). 

In March 2004, the ISO proposed a market structure responsive to FERC's directions.  See Devon Power LLC, 107 FERC P61,240, p. 62,020 (2004).  FERC set the matter for hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who issued a 177-page order largely accepting the ISO's proposal.  Devon Power LLC, 111 FERC P63,063, p. 65,205 (2005).  Several parties filed exceptions to the ALJ's order; on September 20, 2005, the full Commission heard arguments on the proposed market structure, and thereafter established settlement procedures.  Devon Power LLC, 113 FERC P61,075, p. 61,271 (2005). 

After four months of negotiations, on March 6, 2006, a settlement was reached.  Of the 115 negotiating parties, only 8 opposed the settlement. 

 The Settlement Agreement installed a "forward capacity market" under which annual auctions would set capacity prices; auctions would be conducted three years in advance of the time when the capacity would be needed.  Devon Power LLC, 115 FERC P61,340, pp. 62,304, 62,306-62,308 (2006).  Each energy provider would be required to purchase enough capacity to meet its share of the "installed capacity requirement," i.e., the minimum level of capacity needed to maintain reliability on the grid, as determined by the ISO.  Id., at 62,307.  For the three-year gap between the first auction and the time when the capacity procured in that auction would be provided,2The transition period runs from December 1, 2006, to June 1, 2010. the Agreement prescribed a series of fixed, transition-period payments to capacity-supplying generators.  Id., at 62,308-62,309. 

The issue before us centers on § 4.C of the Agreement (hereinafter Mobile-Sierra provision).  Under that provision, challenges to both transition-period payments and auction-clearing prices would be adjudicated under "the 'public interest' standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332, [76 S. Ct. 373, 100 L. Ed. 373] (1956)[,] and [FPC]v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, [76 S. Ct. 368, 100 L. Ed. 388] (1956) (the 'Mobile-Sierra' doctrine)."  App. 95.  Mobile-Sierra applies, § 4.C instructs, "whether the [price is challenged] by a Settling Party, a non-Settling Party, or [by] the FERC acting sua sponte." Ibid.

FERC approved the Settlement Agreement, "finding that as a package, it presents a just and reasonable outcome for this proceeding consistent with the public interest."  115 FERC, at 62,304.  The Mobile-Sierra provision, FERC explicitly determined, "appropriately balances the need for rate stability and the interests of the diverse entities who will be subject to the [forward capacity market's auction system]."  Id., at 62,335. 

 Six of the eight objectors to the settlement sought review in the D. C. Circuit.  For the most part, the Court of Appeals rejected the objectors' efforts to overturn FERC's order approving the settlement. 520 F.3d, at 467.  But the objectors prevailed on the Mobile-Sierra issue:  The D. C. Circuit held that Mobile-Sierra applies only to contracting parties.  Id., at 478.  In this Court, the parties have switched places.  Defenders of the settlement, including the Mobile-Sierra provision, are petitioners; objectors to the settlement, victorious in the Court of Appeals only on the Mobile-Sierra issue, are respondents. 

Because of the importance of the issue, and in light of our recent decision in Morgan Stanley, we granted certiorari, 556 U.S. 1207, 129 S. Ct. 2050, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1132 (2009), to resolve this question:  "[Does] Mobile-Sierra's public-interest standard appl[y] when a contract rate is challenged by an entity that was not a party to the contract[?]" Brief for Petitioners i.  Satisfied that the answer to that question is yes, we reverse the D. C. Circuit's judgment insofar as it rejected application of Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties. 

II 

The FPA gives FERC authority to regulate the "sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce."  See 16 U.S.C. § 824(b)(1).  The Act allows regulated utilities to set rates unilaterally by tariff; alternatively, sellers and buyers may agree on rates by contract.  See § 824d(c), (d).  Whether set by tariff or contract, however, all rates must be "just and reasonable."  § 824d(a).  Rates may be examined by the Commission, upon complaint or on its own initiative, when a new or altered tariff or contract is filed or after a rate goes into effect.  §§ 824d(e), 824e(a).  Following a hearing, the Commission may set aside any rate found "unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential," and replace it with a just and reasonable rate.  § 824e(a). 

 The Mobile-Sierra doctrine originated in twin decisions announced on the same day in 1956:  United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332, 76 S. Ct. 373, 100 L. Ed. 373, and FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348, 76 S. Ct. 368, 100 L. Ed. 388.  Both concerned rates set by contract rather than by tariff.  Mobile involved the Natural Gas Act, which, like the FPA, requires utilities to file all new rates with the regulatory commission. 15 U.S.C. § 717c(c).  In Mobile, we rejected a gas utility's argument that the file-all-new-rates requirement authorized the utility to abrogate a lawful contract with a purchaser simply by filing a new tariff. 350 U.S., at 336-337, 76 S. Ct. 373, 100 L. Ed. 373. Filing, we explained, was a precondition to changing a rate, not an authorization to do so in violation of a lawful contract.  Id., at 339-344, 76 S. Ct. 373, 100 L. Ed. 373; see Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S., at 533, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607. 

The Sierra case involved a further issue.  Not only had the Commission erroneously concluded that a newly filed tariff superseded a contract rate.  In addition, the Commission had suggested that, in any event, the contract rate, which the utility sought to escape, was itself unjust and unreasonable.  The Commission thought that was so "solely because [the contract rate] yield[ed] less than a fair return on the [utility's] net invested capital."  350 U.S., at 355, 76 S. Ct. 368, 100 L. Ed. 388 

The Commission's suggestion prompted this Court to home in on "the question of how the Commission may evaluate whether a contract rate is just and reasonable."  Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S., at 533, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607.  The Sierra Court answered the question this way: "[T]he Commission's conclusion appears on its face to be based on an erroneous standard.  . . .  [W]hile it may be that the Commission may not normally impose upon a public utility a rate which would produce less than a fair return, it does not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a rate affording less than a fair return or that, if it does so, it is entitled to be relieved of its improvident bargain. . . .  In such circumstances the sole concern of the Commission would seem  to be whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest--as where it might impair the financial ability of the public utility to continue its service, cast upon other consumers an excessive burden, or be unduly discriminatory."  350 U.S., at 354-355, 76 S. Ct. 368, 100 L. Ed. 388  (some emphasis added).

In a later case, we similarly explained:  "The regulatory system created by the [FPA] is premised on contractual agreements voluntarily devised by the regulated companies; it contemplates abrogation of these agreements only in circumstances of unequivocal public necessity."  Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 822, 88 S. Ct. 1344, 20 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1968).3Consistent with the lead role of contracts recognized in Mobile-Sierra, we held in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Memphis Light, Gas and Water Div., 358 U.S. 103, 110-113, 79 S. Ct. 194, 3 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1958), that parties may contract out of the Mobile-Sierra presumption.  They could do so, we ruled, by specifying in their contracts that a new rate filed with the Commission would supersede the contract rate.  Courts of Appeals have approved an option midway between Mobile-Sierra and Memphis Light: A contract that does not allow the seller to supersede the contract rate by filing a new rate may nonetheless permit the Commission to set aside the contract rate if it results in an unfair rate of return, without a further showing that it adversely affects the public interest.  See, e.g., Papago Tribal Util. Auth. v. FERC, 723 F.2d 950, 953, 232 U.S. App. D.C. 424 (CADC 1983); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. FERC, 587 F.2d 671, 675-676 (CA5 1979).

Two Terms ago, in Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S. 527, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607, the Court reaffirmed and clarified the Mobile-Sierra doctrine.  That case presented two questions:  First, does the Mobile-Sierra presumption (that contract rates freely negotiated between sophisticated parties meet the just-and-reasonable standard imposed by 16 U.S.C. § 824d(a)) "apply only when FERC has had an initial opportunity to review a contract rate without the presumption?" 554 U.S., at 531, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607.  "Second, does the presumption [generally] impose as high a bar to challenges by purchasers of wholesale electricity as it does to challenges by sellers?" Id., at 531, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607; see  id., at 548, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607.  Answering  no to the first question and yes to the second, the Court emphasized the essential role of contracts as a key factor fostering stability in the electricity market, to the long run benefit of consumers.  Id., at 547-548, 551, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 ; see, e.g., Market-Based Rates P 6, 72 Fed. Reg. 39906 (2007) (noting chilling effect on investments caused by "uncertainties regarding rate stability and contract sanctity"); Nevada Power Co. v. Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, L. L. C., 99 FERC P61,047, pp. 61,184, 61,190 (2002) ("Competitive power markets simply cannot attract the capital needed to build adequate generating infrastructure without regulatory certainty, including certainty that the Commission will not modify market-based contracts unless there are extraordinary circumstances."). 

Morgan Stanley did not reach the question presented here:  Does Mobile-Sierra's public interest standard apply to challenges to contract rates brought by noncontracting parties?  ButMorgan Stanley's reasoning strongly suggests that the D. C. Circuit's negative answer misperceives the aim, and diminishes the force, of the Mobile-Sierra doctrine. 

In unmistakably plain language, Morgan Stanley restated Mobile-Sierra's instruction to the Commission:  FERC "must presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale-energy contract meets the 'just and reasonable' requirement imposed by law.  The presumption may be overcome only if FERC concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest."  554 U.S., at 530, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 .  As our instruction to FERC in Morgan Stanley conveys, the public interest standard is not, as the D. C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and sometimes at odds with, the "just and reasonable" standard, see 520 F.3d, at 478; rather, the public interest standard defines "what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context."  Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S., at 546, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 .  And if FERC itself must presume just and reasonable a contract rate resulting  from fair, arms-length negotiations, how can it be maintained that noncontracting parties nevertheless may escape that presumption?4The D. C. Circuit emphasized a point no doubt true, but hardly dispositive:  Contracts bind parties, not nonparties.  Maine Pub. Util. Comm'n v. FERC, 520 F.3d 464, 478, 380 U.S. App. D.C. 257 (2008)(per curiam).Mobile-Sierraholds sway, however, because well-informed wholesale-market participants of approximately equal bargaining power generally can be expected to negotiate just-and-reasonable rates, see Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U.S. 527, 545, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2008) ), and because "contract stability ultimately benefits consumers," id., at 551, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607 .  These reasons for the presumption explain why FERC, surely not legally bound by a contract rate, must apply the presumption and, correspondingly, why third parties are similarly controlled by it.

Moreover,  the Mobile-Sierra doctrine does not overlook third-party interests; it is framed with a view to their protection.  The doctrine directs the Commission to reject a contract rate that "seriously harms the consuming public."  Morgan Stanley, 554 U.S., at 545-546, 128 S. Ct. 2733, 171 L. Ed. 2d 607; see Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 479, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002) (When a buyer and a seller agree upon a rate, "the principal regulatory responsibility [i]s not to relieve a contracting party of an unreasonable rate, . . . but to protect against potential discrimination by favorable contract rates between allied businesses to the detriment of other wholesale customers."  (emphasis added)). 

Finally, as earlier indicated, see supra, at ____ - ____, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 651, the D. C. Circuit's confinement of Mobile-Sierra to rate challenges by contracting parties diminishes the animating purpose of the doctrine:  promotion of "the stability of supply arrangements which all agree is essential to the health of the [energy] industry."  Mobile, 350 U.S., at 344, 76 S. Ct. 373, 100 L. Ed. 373.  That dominant concern was expressed by FERC in the order on review:  "Stability is particularly important in this case, which was initiated in part because of the unstable nature of [installed capacity] revenues and the effect that has on generating units, particularly those . . .  critical to maintaining reliability."  115 FERC, at 62,335.  A presumption applicable to contracting parties only, and inoperative as to everyone else--consumers, advocacy groups, state utility commissions, elected officials acting parens patriae--could scarcely provide the stability Mobile-Sierra aimed to secure.5The FPA authorizes "[a]ny person, electric utility, State, municipality, or State commission" to complain.  16 U.S.C. § 825e (emphasis added).  FERC regulations similarly permit "[a]ny person [to] file a complaint seeking Commission action."  18 CFR § 385.206(a) (2009) (emphasis added).

We therefore hold that the Mobile-Sierra presumption does not depend on the identity of the complainant who seeks FERC investigation.  The presumption is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties.  It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by third parties. 

III 

The objectors to the settlement appearing before us maintain that the rates at issue in this case--the auction rates and the transition payments--are prescriptions of general applicability rather than "contractually negotiated rates," hence Mobile-Sierra is inapplicable.  See Brief for Respondents 15-17, and n 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).  FERC agrees that the rates covered by the settlement "are not themselves contract rates to which the Commission was required to apply Mobile-Sierra." Brief for FERC 15.  But, FERC urges, "the Commission had discretion to do so," id., at 28; furthermore, "[t]he court of appeals' error in creating a third-party exception to the Mobile-Sierra presumption is a sufficient basis for reversing its judgment," id., at 22.  Whether the rates at issue qualify as "contract rates," and, if not, whether FERC had discretion to treat them analogously are questions raised before, but not ruled upon by, the Court of Appeals.  They remain open for that court's consideration on remand.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16. 

*   *   * 

 For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit is reversed to the extent that it rejects the application of Mobile-Sierra to noncontracting parties, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

We decide whether the Florida felony offense of battery by “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person, Fla. Stat. § 784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), “has as an element the use . . . of physical force against the person of another,” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), and thus constitutes a “violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act, § 924(e)(1).

I 

Curtis Johnson pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation  of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The Government sought an enhanced penalty under § 924(e), which provides that a person who violates § 922(g) and who “has three previous convictions” for “a violent felony” “committed on occasions different from one another” shall be imprisoned for a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. A “violent felony” is defined as “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that:

“(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or“(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” § 924(e)(2)(B).

Johnson's indictment specified five prior felony convictions. The Government contended that three of those convictions--for aggravated battery and for burglary of a dwelling in October 1986, and for battery in May 2003--rendered Johnson eligible for sentencing under § 924(e)(1). At the sentencing hearing, Johnson did not dispute that the two 1986 convictions were for “violent felon[ies],” but he objected to counting his 2003 battery conviction. That conviction was for  simple battery under Florida law, which ordinarily is a first-degree misdemeanor, Fla. Stat. § 784.03(1)(b), but is a third-degree felony for a defendant who (like Johnson) has been convicted of battery (even simple battery) before, § 784.03(2).

 Under § 784.03(1)(a), a battery occurs when a person either “1. [a]ctually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other,” or “2. [i]ntentionally causes bodily harm to another person.” Because the elements of the offense are disjunctive, the prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways. State v. Hearns, 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007). It can prove that the defendant  “[i]ntentionally caus[ed] bodily harm,” that he “intentionally str[uck]” the victim, or that he merely “[a]ctually and intentionally touche[d]” the victim.

Since nothing in the record of Johnson's 2003 battery conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it rested upon anything more than the least of these acts, see Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (2005) (plurality opinion), his conviction was a predicate conviction for a “violent felony” under the Armed Career Criminal Act only if “[a]ctually and intentionally touch[ing]” another person constitutes the use of “physical force” within the meaning of § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). The District Court concluded that it does, and accordingly sentenced Johnson under § 924(e)(1) to a prison term of 15 years and 5 months.

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed. 528 F.3d 1318 (2008). We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1315, 173 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2009).

II 

Florida has a statute similar to the Armed Career Criminal Act that imposes mandatory-minimum sentences upon “violent career criminal[s],” Fla. Stat. § 775.084(4)(d) (2007), defined to mean persons who have three convictions for certain felonies, including any “forcible felony,” § 775.084(1)(d)(1)(a). “[F]orcible felony” is defined to include a list of enumerated felonies--including murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, carjacking, aggravated assault, and aggravated battery--and also “any other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.” § 776.08. In Hearns, the Florida Supreme Court held that the felony offense of battery on a law enforcement officer, § 784.07(2)(b) --which requires the same conduct (directed against a law enforcement officer) as misdemeanor battery under § 784.03(1)(a) --was not a forcible felony. See 961 So. 2d, at 219. It said that since § 784.03(1)(a) requires proof of only the slightest unwanted physical touch,  “the use . . . of physical force” was not an element of the offense. Id., at 219.

Johnson argues that in deciding whether any unwanted physical touching constitutes “physical force” under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), we are bound by the Florida Supreme Court's conclusion in Hearns that it does not constitute “physical force.” That is not so. The meaning of “physical force” in § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) is a question of federal law, not state law. And in answering that question we are not bound by a state court's interpretation of a similar--or even identical--state statute.

We are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements of Fla. Stat. § 784.03(2). See Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, 916, 117 S. Ct. 1800, 138 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1997).  The Florida Supreme Court has held that the element of “actually and intentionally touching” under Florida's battery law is satisfied by any intentional physical contact, “no matter how slight.” Hearns, 961 So. 2d, at 218. The most “nominal contact,” such as a “ta[p] . . . on the shoulder without consent,” id., at 219, establishes a violation. We apply “th[is] substantive elemen[t] of the criminal offense,” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 324, n. 16, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979), in determining whether a felony conviction for battery under Fla. Stat. § 784.03(2) meets the definition of “violent felony” in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i).

III 

 Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) does not define “physical force,” and we therefore give the phrase its ordinary meaning. Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144-145, 116 S. Ct. 501, 133 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1995). The adjective “physical” is clear in meaning but not of much help to our inquiry. It plainly refers to force exerted by and through concrete bodies--distinguishing physical force from, for example, intellectual force or emotional force. It is the noun that poses the difficulty; “force” has a number of meanings. For present purposes we can exclude its specialized  meaning in the field of physics: a cause of the acceleration of mass. Webster's New International Dictionary 986 (2d ed. 1954) (hereinafter Webster's Second). In more general usage it means “[s]trength or energy; active power; vigor; often an unusual degree of strength or energy,” “[p]ower to affect strongly in physical relations,” or “[p]ower, violence, compulsion, or constraint exerted upon a person.” Id., at 985. Black's Law Dictionary 717 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's) defines “force” as “[p]ower, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing.” And it defines “physical force” as “[f]orce consisting in a physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.” Ibid. All of these definitions suggest a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching.

There is, however, a more specialized legal usage of the word “force”: its use in describing one of the elements of the common-law crime of battery, which consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another. See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 7.15(a), p. 301 (1986 and Supp. 2003); accord, Black's 173. The common law held this element of “force” to be satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 120 (1768) (hereinafter Blackstone); Lynch v. Commonwealth, 131 Va. 762, 765, 109 S. E. 427, 428 (1921); see also 2 LaFave & Scott, supra, § 7.15(a). The question is whether the term “force” in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) has the specialized meaning that it bore in the common-law definition of battery. The Government asserts that it does. We disagree.

 Although a common-law term of art should be given its established common-law meaning, United States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 411, 77 S. Ct. 397, 1 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1957), we do not assume that a statutory word is used as a term of art where that meaning does not fit. Ultimately, context determines meaning, Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859, 1961-2 C.B. 254 (1961), and we “do not force term-of-art definitions into contexts where they plainly  do not fit and produce nonsense,” Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 282, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting). Here we are interpreting the phrase “physical force” as used in defining not the crime of battery, but rather the statutory category of “violent felon[ies],” § 924(e)(2)(B). In Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2004), we interpreted the statutory definition of “crime of violence” in 18 U.S.C. § 16. That provision is very similar to § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), in that it includes any felony offense which “has as an element the use . . . of physical force against the person or property of another,” § 16(a). We stated:

“In construing both parts of § 16, we cannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term 'crime of violence.' The ordinary meaning of this term, combined with § 16's emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes . . . .” 543 U.S., at 11, 125 S. Ct. 377, 160 L. Ed. 2d 271.

Just so here. We think it clear that  in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony,” the phrase “physical force” means violent force--that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person. See Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 666, 672 (CA7 2003) (Easterbrook, J.). Even by itself, the word “violent” in § 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force. Webster's Second 2846 (defining “violent” as “[m]oving, acting, or characterized, by physical force, esp. by extreme and sudden or by unjust or improper force; furious; severe; vehement . . . ”); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989) (“[c]haracterized by the exertion of great physical force or strength”); Black's 1706 (“[o]f, relating to, or characterized by strong physical force”). When the adjective “violent” is attached to the noun “felony,” its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer. See id., at 1188 (defining “violent felony” as “[a] crime characterized by extreme physical force, such as murder, forcible rape, and  assault and battery with a dangerous weapon”); see also United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.) (“[T]he term to be defined, 'violent felony,' . . . calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence”).

It is significant, moreover, that the meaning of “physical force” the Government would seek to import into this definition of “violent felony” is a meaning derived from a common-law misdemeanor.At common law, battery--all battery, and not merely battery by the merest touching--was a misdemeanor, not a felony. See 4 Blackstone 216-218 (1769); see also 1 LaFave & Scott, supra, § 2.1(b), at 90; ALI, Model Penal Code § 211.1, Comment, p. 175 (1980). As the dissent points out, post, at 149-150, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 15-16 (opinion of Alito, J.), the dividing line between misdemeanors and felonies has shifted over time. But even today a simple battery--whether of the mere-touching or bodily-injury variety--generally is punishable as a misdemeanor.1The dissent notes, post, at 150, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 15-16, that, around the time the Armed Career Criminal Act became law, in “quite a few States” it was a felony offense to commit an unwanted physical touching of certain victims, such as police officers. That would be relevant for determining whether a conviction under one of those statutes meets the 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) requirement of being a “felony” conviction. But it has no bearing upon whether the substantive element of those offenses--making unwanted physical contact with certain special categories of individuals--involves the use of “force” within the meaning of § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), a statute applicable to all victims. See, e.g., 2 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 16.1(b) (2d ed. 2003 and Supp. 2009-2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann. §§ 242 and 243 (West 2008); Fla. Stat. § 784.03(1)(b); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, § 5/12-3(b) (West 2009); Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 22.01(b) (West Supp. 2009). It is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining “violent felony” a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its definition of a misdemeanor. Of course “physical force” can be given its common-law misdemeanor meaning by artful language, but here the only text that can be claimed to accomplish that is the phrase “physical  force” itself. Since, as we have seen, that is as readily (indeed, much more readily) taken to describe violent force, there is no reason to define “violent felony? by reference to a nonviolent misdemeanor.

The Government argues that we cannot construe 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) to reach only offenses that have as an element the use of violent force, because there is no modifier in § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) that specifies the degree of “physical force” required. As we have discussed, however, the term “physical force” itself normally connotes force strong enough to constitute “power”--and all the more so when it is contained in a definition of “violent felony.” Nor is there any merit to the dissent's contention, post, at 148-149, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 14, that the term “force” in § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) cannot be read to require violent force, because Congress specifically named “burglary” and “extortion” as “violent felon[ies]” in § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) notwithstanding that those offenses can be committed without violence. The point would have force (so to speak) if burglary and extortion were listed in § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), as felonies that have “as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.” In fact, however, they are listed in § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) as examples of felonies that “presen[t] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” The Government has not argued that intentional, unwanted touching qualifies under this latter provision. What the dissent's argument comes down to, then, is the contention that, since felonies that create a serious risk of physical injury qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(ii), felonies that involve a mere unwanted touching must involve the use of physical force and qualify as violent felonies under subparagraph (B)(i).  That obviously does not follow.2Even further afield is the dissent's argument, post, at 147, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 13-14, that since § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) requires conduct that “presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) must not. That is rather like saying a provision which includes (i) apples and (ii) overripe oranges must exclude overripe apples. It does not follow.

 The Government also asks us to draw a negative inference from the presence of the “bodily injury” specification added to the phrase “physical force” in § 922(g)(8)(C)(ii).  That provision forbids the possession of firearms by a person subject to a court order explicitly prohibiting the “use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against [an] intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.” Ibid. The absence of such language in § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), the Government contends, proves that the merest touch suffices. Even as a matter of logic that does not follow. Specifying that “physical force” must rise to the level of bodily injury does not suggest that without the qualification “physical force” would consist of the merest touch. It might consist, for example, of only that degree of force necessary to inflict pain--a slap in the face, for example. Moreover, this is not a case where Congress has “include[d] particular language in one section of a statute but omit[ted] it in another section of the same Act,” Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S. Ct. 296, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). Section 922(g)(8)(C)(ii) was enacted into law in 1994--eight years after enactment of the language in§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Compare Pub. L. 103-322, § 110401, 108 Stat. 2015 (1994), with Pub. L. 99-570, § 1402, 100 Stat. 3207-39 (1986).

IV 

The Government contends that interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) to require violent force will undermine its ability to enforce the firearm disability in § 922(g)(9) for persons who previously have been convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,” which is defined to include certain misdemeanor offenses that have, “as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . ,” § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The prediction is unfounded. We have interpreted the phrase “physical force” only in the context of a statutory definition of “violent felony.” We do not decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the context of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The issue is not before us, so we do not decide it.

In a similar vein, the Government asserts that our interpretation will make it more difficult to remove, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E), an alien convicted of a “crime of domestic violence.” That phrase is defined to mean “any crime of violence (as defined in [18 U.S.C. § 16])” committed by certain persons, including spouses, former spouses, and parents. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Government contends it will be harder to obtain removal based upon battery convictions that, like those in Florida, do not require the use of violent physical force. The dissent likewise anticipates that in the States it has identified, post, at 151-152, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 16, and n. 3, as having generic felony-battery statutes that cover both violent force and unwanted physical contact, our decision will render convictions under those statutes “outside the scope of [the Armed Career Criminal Act],” post, at 152, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 16.

This exaggerates the practical effect of our decision.  When the law under which the defendant has been convicted contains statutory phrases that cover several different generic crimes, some of which require violent force and some of which do not, the “ 'modified categorical approach' ” that we have approved, Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 41, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 174 L. Ed. 2d 22, 31 (2009), permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record--including charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms. See Chambers v. United States, 555 U.S. 122, 126, 129 S. Ct. 687, 172 L. Ed. 2d 484, 490 (2009); Shepard, 544 U.S., at 26, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (plurality opinion); Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S. Ct. 2143, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1990). Indeed, the Government has in the past obtained convictions under the Armed Career Criminal Act in precisely this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Simms, 441 F.3d 313, 316-317 (CA4 2006) (Maryland battery); cf. United States v. Robledo-Leyva, 307 Fed. Appx. 859, 862 (CA5) (Florida battery), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 831, 130 S. Ct. 64, 175 L. Ed. 2d 47 (2009); United States v. Luque-Barahona, 272 Fed. Appx. 521, 524-525 (CA7 2008) (same).

It may well be true, as the Government contends, that in many cases state and local records from battery convictions will be incomplete. But absence of records will often frustrate application of the modified categorical approach--not just to battery but to many other crimes as well. See, e.g.,Shepard, supra, at 22-23, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 161 L. Ed. 2d 205 (burglary). It is implausible that avoiding that common-enough consequence with respect to the single crime of battery, under the single statute that is the Armed Career Criminal Act, caused Congress to import a term of art that is a comical misfit with the defined term “violent felony.”



The Government asks us to remand to the Eleventh Circuit for its consideration of whether Johnson's 2003 battery conviction is a “violent felony” within the meaning of the so-called “residual clause” in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We decline to do so. The Government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause. App. 44-45. Moreover, the parties briefed the § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) issue to the Eleventh Circuit, which nonetheless reasoned that if Johnson's conviction under Fla. Stat. § 784.03(2) satisfied § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), then it was a predicate “violent felony” under § 924(e)(1); but “if not, then not.” 528 F.3d at 1320.

We reverse the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit, set aside Johnson's sentence, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA or Act), 92 Stat. 322, 15 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq., limits the circumstances in which petroleum franchisors may “terminate” a franchise or “fail to renew” a franchise relationship. § 2802. In these consolidated cases, service-station franchisees brought suit under the Act, alleging that a franchisor had constructively “terminate[d]” their franchises and had constructively “fail[ed] to renew” their franchise relationships. They asserted these claims even though the conduct of which they  complained had not compelled any of them to abandon their franchises and even though they had been offered and had accepted renewal agreements. We hold that a franchisee cannot recover for constructive termination under the PMPA if the franchisor's allegedly wrongful conduct did not compel the franchisee to abandon its franchise. Additionally, we conclude that a franchisee who signs and operates under a renewal agreement with a franchisor may not maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal. We therefore reverse in part and affirm in part.

 A 

Petroleum refiners and distributors supply motor fuel to the public through service stations that often are operated by independent franchisees. In the typical franchise arrangement, the franchisor leases the service-station premises to the franchisee, grants the franchisee the right to use the franchisor's trademark, and agrees to sell motor fuel to the franchisee for resale. Franchise agreements remain in effect for a stated term, after which the parties can opt to renew the franchise relationship by executing a new agreement.

Enacted in 1978, the PMPA was a response to widespread concern over increasing numbers of allegedly unfair franchise terminations and nonrenewals in the petroleum industry. See, e.g., Comment, 1980 Duke L. J. 522, 524-531. The Act establishes minimum federal standards governing the termination and nonrenewal of petroleum franchises.  Under the Act's operative provisions, a franchisor may “terminate” a “franchise” during the term stated in the franchise agreement and may “fail to renew” a “franchise relationship” at the conclusion of that term only if the franchisor provides written notice and takes the action in question for a reason specifically recognized in the statute. 15 U.S.C. §§ 2802, 2804. Consistent with the typical franchise arrangement, a “franchise” is defined as “any contract” that authorizes a  franchisee to use the franchisor's trademark, as well as any associated agreement providing for the supply of motor fuel or authorizing the franchisee to occupy a service station owned by the franchisor.1Courts sometimes describe these three types of agreements as the “statutory elements” of a petroleum franchise. See, e.g., Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F.3d 33, 37, n. 1 (CA1 2008).§ 2801(1). The Act defines a “franchise relationship” in more general terms: the parties' “respective motor fuel marketing or distribution obligations and responsibilities” that result from the franchise arrangement. § 2801(2).

 To enforce these provisions, a franchisee may bring suit in federal court against any franchisor that fails to comply with the Act's restrictions on terminations and nonrenewals. See § 2805. Successful franchisees can benefit from a wide range of remedies, including compensatory and punitive damages, reasonable attorney's fees and expert costs, and equitable relief. See §§ 2805(b), (d). The Act also requires district courts to grant preliminary injunctive relief to aggrieved franchisees, if there are “sufficiently serious questions going to the merits” that present “a fair ground for litigation” and the balance of hardships favors such relief. § 2805(b)(2).

B 

This litigation involves a dispute between Shell Oil Company (Shell), a petroleum franchisor, and several Shell franchisees in Massachusetts.2Shell Oil Products Company LLC, another party in this litigation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Oil Company. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 08-372, p. iii. Pursuant to their franchise agreements with Shell, each franchisee was required to pay Shell monthly rent for use of the service-station premises. For many years, Shell offered the franchisees a rent subsidy that reduced the monthly rent by a set amount for every gallon of motor fuel a franchisee sold above a specified threshold. Shell renewed the subsidy annually through notices  that “explicitly provided for cancellation [of the rent subsidy] with thirty days' notice.” Marcoux v. Shell Oil Prods. Co., 524 F.3d 33, 38 (CA1 2008). Nonetheless, Shell representatives made various oral representations to the franchisees “that the [s]ubsidy or something like it would always exist.” Ibid.

In 1998, Shell joined with two other oil companies to create Motiva Enterprises LLC (Motiva), a joint venture that combined the companies' petroleum-marketing operations in the eastern United States. Id., at 37. Shell assigned to Motiva its rights and obligations under the relevant franchise agreements. Motiva, in turn, took two actions that led to this lawsuit. First, effective January 1, 2000, Motiva ended the volume-based rent subsidy, thus increasing the franchisees' rent. Id., at 38. Second, as each franchise agreement expired, Motiva offered the franchisees new agreements that contained a different formula for calculating rent. For some (but not all) of the franchisees, annual rent was greater under the new formula.

 C 

In July 2001, 63 Shell franchisees (hereinafter dealers) filed suit against Shell and Motiva in Federal District Court. Their complaint alleged that Motiva's discontinuation of the rent subsidy constituted a breach of contract under state law. Additionally, the dealers asserted two claims under the PMPA. First, they maintained that Shell and Motiva, by eliminating the rent subsidy, had “constructively terminated” their franchises in violation of the Act. Second, they claimed that Motiva's offer of new franchise agreements that calculated rent using a different formula amounted to a “constructive nonrenewal” of their franchise relationships.3The dealers also claimed that Shell and Motiva had violated the Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Massachusetts, by setting unreasonable prices under the open-price terms of their fuel-supply agreements with the dealers. The jury found in favor of the dealers on this claim, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 524 F.3d, at 51. That issue is not before us.524 F.3d, at 47.

 After a 2-week trial involving eight of the dealers, the jury found against Shell and Motiva on all claims. Both before and after the jury's verdict, Shell and Motiva moved for judgment as a matter of law on the dealers' two PMPA claims. They argued that they could not be found liable for constructive termination under the Act because none of the dealers had abandoned their franchises in response to Motiva's elimination of the rent subsidy--something Shell and Motiva said was a necessary element of any constructive termination claim. Similarly, they argued that the dealers' constructive nonrenewal claims necessarily failed because seven of the eight dealers had signed and operated under renewal agreements with Motiva, and the eighth had sold his franchise prior to the expiration of his franchise agreement. The District Court denied these motions, and Shell and Motiva appealed.

The First Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. In affirming the judgment on the dealers' constructive termination claims, the Court of Appeals held that a franchisee is not required to abandon its franchise to recover for constructive termination under the PMPA. See id., at 45-47. Instead, the court ruled, a simple breach of contract by an assignee of a franchise agreement can amount to constructive termination under the Act, so long as the breach resulted in “such a material change that it effectively ended the lease, even though the [franchisee] continued to operate [its franchise].” Id., at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). Turning to the dealers' constructive nonrenewal claims, the First Circuit agreed with Shell and Motiva that a franchisee cannot maintain a claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA “where the franchisee has signed and operates under the renewal agreement complained of.” Id., at 49. The court thus reversed the judgment on those claims.

We granted certiorari. See 557 U.S. 903, 129 S. Ct. 2788, 174 L. Ed. 2d 289 (2009).

 II 

The first question we are asked to decide is whether a service-station franchisee may recover for constructive termination under the PMPA when the franchisor's allegedly wrongful conduct did not force the franchisee to abandon its franchise. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that  a necessary element of any constructive termination claim under the Act is that the franchisor's conduct forced an end to the franchisee's use of the franchisor's trademark, purchase of the franchisor's fuel, or occupation of the franchisor's service station.4Because resolving this question is sufficient to decide these cases, we need not address Shell and Motiva's alternative argument that the PMPA does not embrace claims for constructive termination at all. Several Courts of Appeals have held that the Act does create a cause of action for constructive termination. See, e.g.,524 F.3d, at 44-45 (case below); Clark v. BP Oil Co., 137 F.3d 386, 390-391 (CA6 1998); Shukla v. BP Exploration & Oil, Inc., 115 F.3d 849, 852-853 (CA11 1997). Others have reserved judgment on the issue. See, e.g., Abrams Shell v. Shell Oil Co., 343 F.3d 482, 486-488 (CA5 2003); Portland 76 Auto/Truck Plaza, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 153 F.3d 938, 948 (CA9 1998). We leave the question for another day.

A 

 When given its ordinary meaning, the text of the PMPA prohibits only that franchisor conduct that has the effect of ending a franchise. As relevant here, the Act provides that ?no franchisor . . . may . . . terminate any franchise,” except for an enumerated reason and after providing written notice. 15 U.S.C. §§ 2802(a)-(b). The Act specifies that “[t]he term 'termination' includes cancellation,” § 2801(17), but it does not further define the term “terminate” or the incorporated term “cancel.” We therefore give those terms their ordinary meanings. See Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S. Ct. 788, 130 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1995).

The word “terminate” ordinarily means “put an end to.” Webster's New International Dictionary 2605 (2d ed. 1957);  see also The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1465 (1967). The term “cancel” carries a similar meaning: to “annul or destroy.” Webster's, supra, at 389; see also Random House, supra, at 215 (“to make void; revoke; annul”). The object of the verb “terminate” is the noun “franchise,” a term the Act defines as “any contract” for the provision of one (or more) of the three elements of a typical petroleum franchise. § 2801(1). Thus, when given its ordinary meaning, the Act is violated only if an agreement for the use of a trademark, purchase of motor fuel, or lease of a premises is “put [to] an end” or “annul[ed] or destroy[ed].” Conduct that does not force an end to the franchise, in contrast, is not prohibited by the Act's plain terms.

The same conclusion follows even if Congress was using the words “terminate” and “cancel” in their technical, rather than ordinary, senses. When Congress enacted the PMPA, those terms had established meanings under the Uniform Commercial Code.5The difference between a “termination” and a “cancellation” under the Uniform Commercial Code relates to how the contracting party justifies its ending of the contractual relationship. A “termination” occurs when “either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach.” U. C. C. § 2-106(3) (1972). By contrast, a “cancellation” occurs when “either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other.” § 2-106(4).That difference might well explain why Congress felt compelled to specify that “cancellation[s],” no less than “termination[s],” are covered by the Act. Prior to the PMPA, franchisors often leveraged their greater bargaining power to end franchise agreements for minor or technical breaches by the franchisee. See, e.g., Chestnut Hill Gulf, Inc. v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 940 F.2d 744, 746-747 (CA1 1991). By specifying that the Act covers “cancellation[s]” as well as “termination[s],” Congress foreclosed any argument that a termination for breach is not covered by the Act because it is technically a “cancellation” rather than a “termination.” Under both definitions, however,  a “termination” or “cancellation” occurs only when a contracting party “puts an end to the contract.” U. C. C. § 2-106(3)-(4) (1972);  see also U. C. C. § 2-106(3)-(4), 1 U.L.A. 695, 695-696 (2004). Thus, a franchisee who continues  operating a franchise--occupying the same premises, receiving the same fuel, and using the same trademark--has not had the franchise “terminate[d]” in either the ordinary or technical sense of the word.

Requiring franchisees to abandon their franchises before claiming constructive termination is also consistent with the general understanding of the doctrine of constructive termination. As applied in analogous legal contexts--both now and at the time Congress enacted the PMPA-- a plaintiff must actually sever a particular legal relationship in order to maintain a claim for constructive termination. For example, courts have long recognized a theory of constructive discharge in the field of employment law. See Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141-143, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204 (2004) (tracing the doctrine to the 1930's). To recover for constructive discharge, however, an employee generally is required to quit his or her job. See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1449 (4th ed. 2007); 3 L. Larson, Labor and Employment Law § 59.05[8] (2009); 2 EEOC Compliance Manual § 612.9(a) (2008); cf. Suders, supra, at 141-143, 148, 124 S. Ct. 2342, 159 L. Ed. 2d 204; Young v. Southwestern Savings & Loan Assn., 509 F.2d 140, 144 (CA5 1975); Muller v. United States Steel Corp., 509 F.2d 923, 929 (CA10 1975). Similarly, landlord-tenant law has long recognized the concept of constructive eviction. See Rapacz, Origin and Evolution of Constructive Eviction in the United States, 1 DePaul L. Rev. 69 (1951). The general rule under that doctrine is that a tenant must actually move out in order to claim constructive eviction. See id., at 75; Glendon, The Transformation of American Landlord-Tenant Law, 23 Boston College L. Rev. 503, 513-514 (1982); 1 H. Tiffany, Real Property §§ 141, 143 (3d ed. 1939).6Before Congress enacted the PMPA, at least one court, it is true, had held that a tenant asserting constructive eviction could obtain declaratory relief without abandoning the premises--although the court observed that the tenant still would have to abandon the premises in order to obtain rescission. See Charles E. Burt, Inc. v. Seven Grand Corp., 340 Mass. 124, 129-130, 163 N.E.2d 4, 7-8 (1959). But as even the dealers concede, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38, the clear majority of authority required a tenant to leave the premises before claiming constructive eviction.For similar reasons, the Second Restatement of Property is of no help to the dealers. Although it would allow a tenant to bring a constructive eviction claim without moving out, it noted that this proposition was “contrary to the present weight of judicial authority.” 1 Restatement (Second) of Property § 6.1, Reporter's Note 1, p. 230 (1976).

 As generally understood in these and other contexts, a termination is deemed “constructive” because it is the plaintiff, rather than the defendant, who formally puts an end to the particular legal relationship--not because there is no end to the relationship at all. There is no reason why a different understanding should apply to constructive termination claims under the PMPA. At the time when it enacted the statute, Congress presumably was aware of how courts applied the doctrine of constructive termination in these analogous legal contexts. Cf. Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 258-259, 129 S. Ct. 788, 172 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009). And in the absence of any contrary evidence, we think it reasonable to interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with this well-established body of law.

The Court of Appeals was of the view that analogizing to doctrines of constructive termination in other contexts was inappropriate because “sunk costs, optimism, and the habit of years might lead franchisees to try to make the new arrangements work, even when the terms have changed so materially as to make success impossible.” 524 F.3d, at 46. But surely these same factors compel employees and tenants--no less than service-station franchisees--to try to make their changed arrangements work. Nonetheless, courts have long required plaintiffs asserting such claims to show an actual severance of the relevant legal relationship. We see no reason for a different rule here.

Additionally, allowing franchisees to obtain PMPA relief for conduct that does not force an end to a franchise would extend the reach of the Act much further than its text and structure suggest. Prior to 1978, the regulation of petroleum  franchise agreements was largely a matter of state law. See Dersch Energies, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 314 F.3d 846, 861 (CA7 2002); Comment, 32 Emory L. J. 273, 277-283 (1983). In enacting the PMPA, Congress did not regulate every aspect of the petroleum franchise relationship but instead federalized only the two parts of that relationship with which it was most concerned: the circumstances in which franchisors may terminate a franchise or decline to renew a franchise relationship. See 15 U.S.C. § 2802; Dersch Energies, supra, at 861-862. Congress left undisturbed state-law regulation of other types of disputes between petroleum franchisors and franchisees. See § 2806(a) (pre-empting only those state laws governing franchise terminations or nonrenewals).

The dealers would have us interpret the PMPA in a manner that ignores the Act's limited scope. On their view, and in the view of the Court of Appeals, the PMPA prohibits, not just unlawful terminations and nonrenewals, but also certain serious breaches of contract that do not cause an end to the franchise. See Brief for Respondents in No. 08-372, pp. 28-35 (hereinafter Respondents' Brief); 524 F.3d, at 44-47. Reading the Act to prohibit simple breaches of contract, however, would be inconsistent with the Act's limited purpose and would further expand federal law into a domain traditionally reserved for the States. Without a clearer indication that Congress intended to federalize such a broad swath of the law governing petroleum franchise agreements, we decline to adopt an interpretation of the Act that would have such sweeping consequences. See, e.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S. Ct. 515, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1971).7Adopting such a broad reading of the PMPA also would have serious implications for run-of-the-mill franchise disputes. The Act requires courts to award attorney's fees and expert-witness fees in any case in which a plaintiff recovers more than nominal damages. See 15 U.S.C. § 2805(d)(1)(C). The Act also permits punitive damages, § 2805(d)(1)(B), a remedy ordinarily not available in breach-of-contract actions, see Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 187-188, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 (2002). Accepting the dealers' reading of the statute, therefore, would turn everyday contract disputes into high-stakes affairs.

 Finally, important practical considerations inform our decision. Adopting the dealers' reading of the PMPA would require us to articulate a standard for identifying those breaches of contract that should be treated as effectively ending a franchise, even though the franchisee in fact continues to use the franchisor's trademark, purchase the franchisor's fuel, and occupy the service-station premises.8The First Circuit, for example, approved of a test that asks whether the breach resulted in “such a material change that it effectively ended the lease, even though the plaintiffs continued to operate [their franchises].” 524 F.3d, at 46 (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard, it seems to us, does little more than restate the relevant question. While we do not decide whether the PMPA contemplates claims for constructive termination, we observe that the Court of Appeals' unwillingness or inability to establish a more concrete standard underscores the difficulties and inherent contradictions involved in crafting a standard for finding a “termination” when no termination has in fact occurred. We think any such standard would be indeterminate and unworkable. How is a court to determine whether a breach is serious enough effectively to end a franchise when the franchisee is still willing and able to continue its operations? And how is a franchisor to know in advance which breaches a court will later determine to have been so serious? The dealers have not provided answers to these questions. Nor could they. Any standard for identifying when a simple breach of contract amounts to a PMPA termination, when all three statutory elements remain operational, simply evades coherent formulation.

B 

The dealers suggest that this interpretation of the PMPA fails to provide franchisees with much-needed protection from unfair and coercive franchisor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise. That argument, however, ignores the fact that franchisees still have state-law remedies available to them.  The pre-emptive scope of the PMPA is limited: The Act pre-empts only those state or local laws that govern the termination of petroleum franchises or the nonrenewal of petroleum franchise relationships. See 15 U.S.C. § 2806(a). Outside of those areas, therefore, franchisees can still rely on state-law remedies to address wrongful franchisor conduct that does not have the effect of ending the franchise. Indeed, that happened in this very lawsuit. The dealers argued in the District Court that Motiva's elimination of the rent subsidy not only constructively terminated their franchises in violation of the PMPA but also amounted to a breach of contract under state law. The jury found in their favor on their state-law claims and awarded them almost $1.3 million in damages. See App. 376-379. Thus, the dealers' own experience demonstrates that franchisees do not need a PMPA remedy to have meaningful protection from abusive franchisor conduct.

The dealers also charge that this interpretation of the PMPA cannot be correct because it renders other provisions of the Act meaningless. Respondents' Brief 21-22, 24-25. While we agree that  we normally should construe statutes “in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions,” we believe our interpretation is faithful to this “well-established principl[e] of statutory interpretation.” United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City of New York, 556 U.S. 928, 933, 129 S. Ct. 2230, 2234, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (2009).

To begin, the dealers insist that our reading of the term “terminate” will require franchisees to go out of business before they can obtain preliminary relief and thus will render useless the Act's preliminary injunction mechanism. We disagree.  To obtain a preliminary injunction, it is true, a franchisee must show, among other things, that “the franchise of which he is a party has been terminated.” 15 U.S.C. § 2805(b)(2)(A)(i) (emphasis added). But that does not necessarily mean that a franchisee must go out of business before obtaining an injunction. For example, in cases of actual termination, the Act requires franchisors to provide  franchisees with written notice of termination well in advance of the date on which the termination “takes effect.” § 2804(a). A franchisee that receives notice of termination “has been terminated” within the meaning of § 2805(b)(2)(A)(i), even though the termination “takes effect” on a later date, just as an employee who receives notice of discharge can be accurately described as having been discharged, even though the employee's last day at work may perhaps be weeks later. Thus, franchisees that receive notice of impending termination can invoke the protections of the Act's preliminary injunction mechanism well before having to go out of business.9The Government reads the Act to permit a dealer to seek preliminary injunctive relief if a franchisor announces its “intent to engage in conduct that would leave the franchisee no reasonable alternative but to abandon” one (or more) of the franchise elements. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21. Because we do not decide whether the PMPA permits constructive termination claims at all, see n. 4, supra, we need not address this argument. Contrary to the dealers' assertions, therefore, our interpretation of the Act gives meaningful effect to the PMPA's preliminary injunction provisions.

Our interpretation also gives effect to the Act's alternative statute-of-limitations accrual dates. The 1-year limitations period governing PMPA claims runs from the later of either (1) “the date of termination of the franchise” or (2) “the date the franchisor fails to comply with the requirements of” the Act. § 2805(a). Some violations of the PMPA, however, cannot occur until after a franchise has been terminated. See, e.g., § 2802(d)(1) (franchisor must share with a franchisee certain parts of a condemnation award when the termination was the result of a condemnation or taking); § 2802(d)(2) (franchisor must grant a franchisee a right of first refusal if the franchise was terminated due to the destruction of the service station and the station subsequently is rebuilt). The second accrual date listed in § 2805(a), therefore, shows only that the limitations period runs from the  date of these types of post-termination violations. It does not suggest that Congress intended franchisees to maintain claims under the PMPA to redress franchisor conduct that does not force an end to the franchise.

We therefore hold that a necessary element of any constructive termination claim under the PMPA is that the complained-of conduct forced an end to the franchisee's use of the franchisor's trademark, purchase of the franchisor's fuel, or occupation of the franchisor's service station. Because none of the dealers in this litigation abandoned any element of their franchise operations in response to Motiva's elimination of the rent subsidy,10After Motiva withdrew the rent subsidy, seven of the dealers continued operating their franchises for the full terms of their franchise agreements and then signed new agreements that did not include the subsidy. See App. 161, 164, 316-321 (Mac's Shell Service, Inc.); id., at 138-139, 314-315 (Cynthia Karol); id., at 154-155, 310-311 (Akmal, Inc.); id., at 185-186, 268-269 (Sid Prashad); id., at 190, 312-313 (J & M Avramidis, Inc.); id., at 179-182, 322-323 (RAM Corp., Inc.); id., at 148-153, 324-325 (John A. Sullivan). These dealers necessarily cannot establish that the elimination of the subsidy “terminate[d]” their franchises “prior to the conclusion of the term” stated in their franchise agreements. 15 U.S.C. § 2802(a)(1). Whether they ceased operations after their franchise agreements expired, moreover, is irrelevant. Indeed, in the Court of Appeals, the dealers abandoned any claim for constructive termination based on the subsequent franchise agreements. See Appellees' Brief in No. 05-2770 etc. (CA1), p. 40, n. 29.One dealer did leave his franchise before his franchise agreement expired. App. 204, 330-331 (Stephen Pisarczyk). But that dealer not only continued to operate for seven months after the subsidy ended, id., at 204, but also during that period entered into an agreement with Motiva to extend the term of his franchise agreement, id., at 330-331. Moreover, that dealer had been planning to leave the service-station business before Motiva eliminated the subsidy, and he never claimed that his decision to leave had anything to do with Motiva's rent policies. See id., at 202-207. they cannot maintain a constructive termination claim on the basis of that conduct.

 III 

The second question we are asked to decide is whether a franchisee who is offered and signs a renewal agreement can nonetheless maintain a claim for “constructive nonrenewal” under the PMPA. For reasons similar to those given above, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a franchisee that chooses to accept a renewal agreement cannot thereafter assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the Act.11As is true with respect to the dealers' constructive termination claims, it is not necessary for us to decide in these cases whether the Act at all recognizes claims for “constructive nonrenewal.” We therefore do not express a view on that question.

 The plain text of the statute leaves no room for a franchisee to claim that a franchisor has unlawfully declined to renew a franchise relationship--constructively or otherwise--when the franchisee has in fact accepted a new franchise agreement. As relevant here, a franchisor violates the PMPA only when it “fail[s] to renew” a franchise relationship for a reason not provided for in the Act or after not providing the required notice. See 15 U.S.C. § 2802. The Act defines the term “fail to renew,” in turn, as a “failure to reinstate, continue, or extend the franchise relationship.” § 2801(14). Thus,  the threshold requirement of any unlawful nonrenewal action--a requirement the franchisee bears the burden of establishing, see § 2805(c)--is that the franchisor did not “reinstate, continue, or renew” the franchise relationship once a franchise agreement expired. But if a franchisee signs a renewal agreement, the franchisor clearly has “reinstate[d], continue[d], or extend[ed]” the franchise relationship. True, the franchisee might find some of the terms in the new agreement objectionable. But the Act prohibits only unlawful “fail[ures] to renew” a franchise relationship, not renewals of a franchise relationship on terms that are less than favorable to the franchisee. A franchisee that signs a renewal agreement, in short, cannot carry the threshold burden of showing a “nonrenewal of the franchise relationship,” § 2805(c), and thus necessarily cannot establish that the franchisor has violated the Act.

The dealers point out that several of them signed their renewal agreements “under protest,” and they argue that they thereby explicitly preserved their ability to assert a claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. That argument misunderstands the legal significance of signing a renewal agreement. Signing a renewal agreement does not constitute a waiver of a franchisee's legal rights--something that signing “under protest” can sometimes help avoid. See, e.g., U. C. C. § 1-207, 1 U. L. A. 318. Instead, signing a renewal agreement negates the very possibility of a violation of the PMPA.  When a franchisee signs a renewal agreement--even “under protest”--there has been no “fail[ure] to renew,” and thus the franchisee has no cause of action under the Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 2805(a).

The Act's structure and purpose confirm this interpretation.  By requiring franchisors to renew only the “franchise relationship,” as opposed to the same franchise agreement, see § 2802; see also § 2801(2), the PMPA contemplates that franchisors can respond to market demands by proposing new and different terms at the expiration of a franchise agreement. To that end, the Act authorizes franchisors to decline to renew a franchise relationship if the franchisee refuses to accept changes or additions that are proposed “in good faith and in the normal course of business” and that are not designed to convert the service station to direct operation by the franchisor. § 2802(b)(3)(A). Additionally, the Act creates a procedural mechanism for resolving disputes over the legality of proposed new terms. If the parties cannot agree, the franchisor has the option of either modifying the objectionable terms or pursuing nonrenewal, in which case it must provide the franchisee with written notice well in advance of the date when the nonrenewal takes effect. § 2804(a)(2). Once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal, it can seek a preliminary injunction under the Act's  relaxed injunctive standard, maintaining the status quo while a court determines the lawfulness of the proposed changes. See § 2805(b)(2); supra, at 188-189, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 45.12The availability of preliminary injunctive relief under the Act also explains why the dealers are wrong to suggest that our holding will force franchisees “to choose between accepting an unlawful and coercive contract in order to stay in business [or] rejecting it and going out of business in order to preserve a cause of action.” Respondents' Brief 51 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A franchisee presented with “unlawful and coercive” terms can simply reject those terms and, if the franchisor pursues nonrenewal, seek a preliminary injunction under the Act once the franchisee receives notice of nonrenewal. Indeed, the PMPA substantially relaxes the normal standard for obtaining preliminary-injunctive relief, § 2805(b)(2)(A)(ii), thus allowing a franchisee with anything close to a meritorious claim to obtain relief. It is possible, of course, that a franchisor could fail to renew a franchise relationship without providing the statutorily required notice. But in that circumstance, a franchisee would not only have a sure-fire claim for unlawful nonrenewal, see § 2802(b)(1)(A), but also presumably could seek a preliminary injunction forcing the franchisor to resume providing the franchise elements for the duration of the litigation.

Allowing franchisees to pursue nonrenewal claims even after they have signed renewal agreements would undermine this procedural mechanism and, in the process, would frustrate franchisors' ability to propose new terms. Under the dealers' theory, franchisees have no incentive to object to burdensome new terms and seek a preliminary injunction if a franchisor pursues nonrenewal. Instead, a franchisee could simply sign the new franchise agreement and decide later whether to sue under the PMPA. Franchisees would then have the option of either continuing to operate under the new agreement or, if the terms of the agreement later proved unfavorable, bringing suit under the PMPA alleging that the newly imposed terms are unlawful. And because the PMPA has a 1-year statute of limitations, see § 2805(a), franchisees would retain that option for the entire first year of a new franchise agreement. Accepting the dealers' argument, therefore, would cast a cloud of uncertainty over all  renewal agreements and could chill franchisors from proposing new terms in response to changing market conditions and consumer needs.

Finally, accepting the dealers' argument would greatly expand the PMPA's reach. Under the balance struck by the plain text of the statute, a franchisee faced with objectionable new terms must decide whether challenging those terms is worth risking the nonrenewal of the franchise relationship; if the franchisee rejects the terms and the franchisor seeks nonrenewal, the franchisee runs the risk that a court will ultimately determine that the proposed terms were lawful under the PMPA. See § 2802(b)(3)(A). That risk acts as a restraint, limiting the scope of franchisor liability under the Act to that with which Congress was most concerned: the imposition of arbitrary and unreasonable new terms on a franchisee that are designed to force an end to the petroleum franchise relationship. See, e.g., ibid.; Comment, 32 Emory L. J., at 277-283. Allowing franchisees both to sign a franchise agreement and to pursue a claim under the PMPA would eliminate that restraint and thus permit franchisees to challenge a much broader range of franchisor conduct--conduct to which the dealer might object but not consider so serious as to risk the nonrenewal of the franchise by mounting a legal challenge. As explained, the PMPA was enacted to address the narrow areas of franchise terminations and nonrenewals, not to govern every aspect of the petroleum franchise relationship. See supra, at 186, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 48; Dersch Energies, 314 F.3d, at 861. We thus decline to adopt an interpretation that would expand the Act in such a fashion.13It also is worth noting that, although the concept of “constructive nonrenewal” does not arise frequently in other areas of the law, the little authority on this concept supports our conclusion that  a plaintiff who signs a new agreement cannot maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal. See American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Baker, 22 F.3d 880, 892-894 (CA9 1994) (insured who accepts a successor insurance policy cannot maintain a claim for constructive nonrenewal of the previous policy); American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pa. v. Continisio, 17 F.3d 62, 65-66 (CA3 1994) (same); Adams v. Greenwood, 10 F.3d 568, 572 (CA8 1993) (same).

* * *

 We hold that a franchisee who is offered and signs a renewed franchise agreement cannot maintain a claim for unlawful nonrenewal under the PMPA. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the dealers' nonrenewal claims.

IV 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed in part and affirmed in part. The cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

We consider in this case what a mutual fund shareholder must prove in order to show that a mutual fund investment adviser breached the “fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services” that is imposed by § 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b) (hereinafter § 36(b)).

I

A 

The Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 789, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-1 et seq., regulates investment companies, including mutual funds. “A mutual fund is a pool of assets, consisting primarily of [a] portfolio [of] securities, and belonging to the individual investors holding shares in the fund.” Burks v. Lasker, 441 U.S 471, 480, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1979). The following arrangements are typical. A separate entity called an investment adviser creates the mutual fund, which may have no employees of its own. See Kamen v. Kemper Financial Services, Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 93, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1991); Daily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U.S. 523, 536, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1984); Burks, 441 U.S., at 480-481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. The adviser selects the fund's directors, manages the fund's investments, and provides other services. See id., at 481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. Because of the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser, the fund often “ 'cannot, as a practical matter sever its relationship with the adviser. Therefore, the forces of arm's-length bargaining do not work in the mutual fund industry in the same manner as they do in other sectors of the American economy.' ” Ibid. (quoting S. Rep. No. 91-184, p. 5 (1969) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).

 “Congress adopted the [Investment Company Act of 1940] because of its concern with the potential for abuse inherent in the structure of investment companies.” Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 536, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (internal quotation marks omitted). Recognizing that the relationship between a fund and its investment adviser was “fraught with potential conflicts of interest,” the Act created protections for mutual fund shareholders. Id., at 536-538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (internal quotation marks omitted); Burks, supra, at 482-483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. Among other things, the Act required that no more than 60 percent of a fund's directors could be affiliated with the adviser and that fees for investment advisers be approved by the directors and the shareholders of the fund. See §§ 10, 15(c), 54 Stat. 806, 813.

The growth of mutual funds in the 1950's and 1960's prompted studies of the 1940 Act's effectiveness in protecting investors. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 537-538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Studies commissioned or authored by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) identified problems relating to the independence of investment company boards and the compensation received by investment advisers. See ibid. In response to such concerns, Congress amended the Act in 1970 and bolstered shareholder protection in two primary ways.

First, the amendments strengthened the “cornerstone” of the Act's efforts to check conflicts of interest, the independence of mutual fund boards of directors, which negotiate and scrutinize adviser compensation. Burks, supra, at 482, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404.  The amendments required that no more than 60 percent of a fund's directors be “persons who are interested persons,” e.g., that they have no interest in or affiliation with the investment adviser.1 An “affiliated person” includes (1) a person who owns, controls, or holds the power to vote 5 percent or more of the securities of the investment adviser; (2) an entity which the investment adviser owns, controls, or in which it holds the power to vote more than 5 percent of the securities; (3) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser; (4) an officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of the investment adviser; (5) an investment adviser or a member of the investment adviser's board of directors; or (6) the depositor of an unincorporated investment adviser. See § 80a-2(a)(3). The Act defines “interested person” to include not only all affiliated persons but also a wider swath of people such as the immediate family of affiliated persons, interested persons of an underwriter or investment adviser, legal counsel for the company, and interested broker-dealers. § 80a-2(a)(19).15 U.S.C. § 80a-10(a);§ 80a-2(a)(19); see also Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. These board members are given “a host of special responsibilities.” Burks, 441 U.S. at 482-483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. In particular, they must “review and approve the contracts of the investment adviser” annually, id., at 483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404, and a majority of these directors must approve an adviser's compensation, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-15(c). Second, § 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, of the Act imposed upon investment advisers a “fiduciary duty” with respect to compensation received from a mutual fund, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b), and granted individual investors a private right of action for breach of that duty, ibid.

The “fiduciary duty” standard contained in § 36(b) represented a delicate compromise. Prior to the adoption of the 1970 amendments, shareholders challenging investment adviser fees under state law were required to meet “common-law standards of corporate waste, under which an unreasonable or unfair fee might be approved unless the court deemed it 'unconscionable' or 'shocking,' ” and “security holders challenging adviser fees under the [Investment Company Act] itself had been required to prove gross abuse of trust.” Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 540, n. 12, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Aiming to give shareholders a stronger remedy, the SEC proposed a provision that would have empowered the Commission to bring actions to challenge a fee that was not “reasonable” and to intervene in any similar action brought by or on behalf of an investment company. Id., at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. This approach was included in a bill that passed the House. H. R. 9510, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., § 8(d) (1967); see also S. 1659, 90th Cong.,  1st Sess., § 8(d) (as introduced May 1, 1967). Industry representatives, however, objected to this proposal, fearing that it “might in essence provide the Commission with ratemaking authority.” Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645.

The provision that was ultimately enacted adopted “a different method of testing management compensation,” id., at 539, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (quoting S. Rep., at 5, internal quotation marks omitted), that was more favorable to shareholders than the previously available remedies but that did not permit a compensation agreement to be reviewed in court for “reasonableness.” This is the fiduciary duty standard in § 36(b).

B 

Petitioners are shareholders in three different mutual funds managed by respondent Harris Associates L. P., an investment adviser. Petitioners filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois pursuant to § 36(b) seeking damages, an injunction, and rescission of advisory agreements between Harris Associates and the mutual funds. The complaint alleged that Harris Associates had violated § 36(b) by charging fees that were “disproportionate to the services rendered” and “not within the range of what would have been negotiated at  arm's length in light of all the surrounding circumstances.” App. 52.

The District Court granted summary judgment for Harris Associates. Applying the standard adopted in Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F.2d 923 (CA2 1982), the court concluded that petitioners had failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to “whether the fees charged . . . were so disproportionately large that they could not have been the result of arm's-length bargaining.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. The District Court assumed that it was relevant to compare the challenged fees with those that Harris Associates charged its other clients. Id., at 30a. But in light of those comparisons as well as comparisons with fees charged by other investment advisers to similar mutual  funds, the court held that it could not reasonably be found that the challenged fees were outside the range that could have been the product of arm's-length bargaining. Id., at 29a-32a.

A panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed based on different reasoning, explicitly “disapprov[ing] the Gartenberg approach.” 527 F.3d 627, 632 (2008). Looking to trust law, the panel noted that, while a trustee “owes an obligation of candor in negotiation,” a trustee, at the time of the creation of a trust, “may negotiate in his own interest and accept what the settlor or governance institution agrees to pay.” Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242, and Comment f). The panel thus reasoned that “[a] fiduciary duty differs from rate regulation. A fiduciary must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation.” 527 F.3d, at 632. In the panel's view, the amount of an adviser's compensation would be relevant only if the compensation were “so unusual” as to give rise to an inference “that deceit must have occurred, or that the persons responsible for decision have abdicated.” Ibid.

The panel argued that this understanding of § 36(b) is consistent with the forces operating in the contemporary mutual fund market. Noting that “[t]oday thousands of mutual funds compete,” the panel concluded that “sophisticated investors” shop for the funds that produce the best overall results, “mov[e] their money elsewhere” when fees are “excessive in relation to the results,” and thus “create a competitive pressure” that generally keeps fees low. Id., at 633-634. The panel faulted Gartenberg on the ground that it “relies too little on markets.” 527 F.3d, at 632. And the panel firmly rejected a comparison between the fees that Harris Associates charged to the funds and the fees that Harris Associates charged other types of clients, observing that “[d]ifferent clients call for different commitments of time” and that costs, such as research, that may benefit several categories of clients “make it hard to draw inferences from fee levels.” Id., at 634.

 The Seventh Circuit denied rehearing en banc by an equally divided vote. 537 F.3d 728 (2008)(per curiam). The dissent from the denial of rehearing argued that the panel's rejection of Gartenberg was based “mainly on an economic analysis that is ripe for reexamination.” 537 F.3d, at 730 (opinion of Posner, J.). Among other things, the dissent expressed concern that Harris Associates charged “its captive funds more than twice what it charges independent funds,” and the dissent questioned whether high adviser fees actually drive investors away. Id., at 731.

 We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over the proper standard under § 36(b).2See 527 F.3d 627 (CA7 2008) (case below); Migdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int'l, Inc., 248 F.3d 321 (CA4 2001); Krantz v. Prudential Invs. Fund Management LLC, 305 F.3d 140 (CA3 2002)(per curiam). After we granted certiorari in this case, another Court of Appeals adopted the standard of Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc., 694 F.2d 923 (CA2 1982). See Gallus v. Ameriprise Financial, Inc., 561 F.3d 816 (CA8 2009).556 U.S. 1104, 129 S. Ct. 1579, 173 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2009).

II

A 

Since Congress amended the Investment Company Act in 1970, the mutual fund industry has experienced exponential growth. Assets under management increased from $38.2 billion in 1966 to over $9.6 trillion in 2008. The number of mutual fund investors grew from 3.5 million in 1965 to 92 million in 2008, and there are now more than 9,000 open- and closed-end funds.3Compare H. R. Rep. No. 2337, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., p. vii (1966), with Investment Company Institute, 2009 Fact Book 15, 20, 72 (49th ed.), online at http://www.icifactbook.org/pdf/2009_factbook.pdf (as visited Mar. 9, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

During this time, the standard for an investment adviser's fiduciary duty has remained an open question in our Court, but, until the Seventh Circuit's decision below, something of a consensus had developed regarding the standard set forth  over 25 years ago in Gartenberg, 694 F.2d 923. The [Gartenberg standard] has been adopted by other federal courts,4See, e.g., Gallus, supra, at 822-823; Krantz, supra; In re Franklin Mut. Funds Fee Litigation, 478 F. Supp. 2d 677, 683, 686 (NJ 2007); Yameen v. Eaton Vance Distributors, Inc., 394 F. Supp. 2d 350, 355 (Mass. 2005); Hunt v. Invesco Funds Group, Inc., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40944, 2006 WL 1581846, *2 (SD Tex., June 5, 2006); Siemers v. Wells Fargo & Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60858, 2006 WL 2355411, *15-*16 (ND Cal., Aug. 14, 2006); see also Amron v. Morgan Stanley Inv. Advisors Inc., 464 F.3d 338, 340-341 (CA2 2006). and “[t]he SEC's regulations have recognized, and formalized, Gartenberg-like factors.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23. See17 CFR § 240.14a-101, Sched. 14A, Item 22, par. (c)(11)(i) (2009); 69 Fed. Reg. 39801, n.3, 39807-39809 (2004). In the present case, both petitioners and respondent generally endorse the Gartenberg approach, although they disagree in some respects about its meaning.

In Gartenberg, the Second Circuit noted that Congress had not defined what it meant by a “fiduciary duty” with respect to compensation but concluded that “the test is essentially whether the fee schedule represents a charge within the range of what would have been negotiated at arm's-length in the light of all of the surrounding circumstances.” 694 F.2d, at 928. The Second Circuit elaborated that, “[t]o be guilty of a violation of § 36(b), . . . the adviser-manager must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining.” Ibid. “To make this determination,” the court stated, “all pertinent facts must be weighed,” id., at 929, and the court specifically mentioned “the adviser-manager's cost in providing the service, . . . the extent to which the adviser-manager realizes economies of scale as the fund grows larger, and the volume of orders which must be processed by the manager,” id., at  930.5 Other factors cited by the Gartenberg court include (1) the nature and quality of the services provided to the fund and shareholders; (2) the profitability of the fund to the adviser; (3) any “fall-out financial benefits,” those collateral benefits that accrue to the adviser because of its relationship with the mutual fund; (4) comparative fee structure (meaning a comparison of the fees with those paid by similar funds); and (5) the independence, expertise, care, and conscientiousness of the board in evaluating adviser compensation. 694 F.2d, at 929-932 (internal quotation marks omitted). Observing that competition among advisers for  the business of managing a fund may be “virtually non-existent,” the court rejected the suggestion that “the principal factor to be considered in evaluating a fee's fairness is the price charged by other similar advisers to funds managed by them,” although the court did not suggest that this factor could not be “taken into account.” Id., at 929. The court likewise rejected the “argument that the lower fees charged by investment advisers to large pension funds should be used as a criterion for determining fair advisory fees for money market funds,” since a “pension fund does not face the myriad of daily purchases and redemptions throughout the nation which must be handled by [a money market fund].” Id., at 930, n. 3.6A money market fund differs from a mutual fund in both the types of investments and the frequency of redemptions. A money market fund often invests in short-term money market securities, such as short-term securities of the United States Government or its agencies, bank certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Investors can invest in such a fund for as little as a day, so, from the investor's perspective, the fund resembles an investment “more like a bank account than [a] traditional investment in securities.” Id., at 925.

B 

The meaning of § 36(b)'s reference to “a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services”7Section 36 (b) provides as follows:   “[T]he investment adviser of a registered investment company shall be deemed to have a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, or of payments of a material nature, paid by such registered investment company, or by the security holders thereof, to such investment adviser.” 84 Stat. 1429 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b)). is hardly pellucid, but based on the terms of that provision and the role that a shareholder action for breach of that duty plays in the overall structure of the Act, we conclude that Gartenberg was correct in its basic formulation of what § 36(b) requires:  To face liability under § 36(b), an investment adviser must charge a fee that is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's/length bargaining.

1 

We begin with the language of § 36(b). As noted, the Seventh Circuit panel thought that the phrase “fiduciary duty” incorporates a standard taken from the law of trusts. Petitioners agree but maintain that the panel identified the wrong trust-law standard. Instead of the standard that applies when a trustee and a settlor negotiate the trustee's fee at the time of the creation of a trust, petitioners invoke the standard that applies when a trustee seeks compensation after the trust is created. Brief for Petitioners 20-23, 35-37. A compensation agreement reached at that time, they point out, “ 'will not bind the beneficiary' if either 'the trustee failed to make a full disclosure of all circumstances affecting the agreement' ” which he knew or should have known or if the agreement is unfair to the beneficiary. Id., at 23 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Trusts § 242, Comment i). Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the term “fiduciary” is not exclusive to the law of trusts, that the phrase means different things in different contexts, and that there is no reason to believe that § 36(b) incorporates the specific meaning of the term in the law of trusts. Brief for Respondent 34-36.

We find it unnecessary to take sides in this dispute. In Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281 (1939), we discussed the meaning of the concept of fiduciary duty in a context that is analogous to that presented here, and we also looked to trust law. At issue in Pepper was whether a bankruptcy court could disallow a dominant or controlling shareholder's claim for compensation against a bankrupt corporation. Dominant  or controlling shareholders, we held, are “fiduciar[ies]” whose “powers are powers [held] in trust.” Id., at 306, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281. We then explained:

 “Their dealings with the corporation are subjected to rigorous scrutiny and where any of their contracts or engagements with the corporation is challenged the burden is on the director or stockholder not only to prove the good faith of the transaction but also to show its inherent fairness from the viewpoint of the corporation and those interested therein. . . . The essence of the test is whether or not under all the circumstances the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm's length bargain. If it does not, equity will set it aside.” Id., at 306-307, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 281 (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see also Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., 254 U.S. 590, 599, 41 S. Ct. 209, 65 L. Ed. 425 (1921) (standard of fiduciary duty for interested directors).

We believe that this formulation expresses the meaning of the phrase “fiduciary duty” in § 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429. The Investment Company Act modifies this duty in a significant way: It shifts the burden of proof from the fiduciary to the party claiming breach, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b)(1), to show that the fee is outside the range that arm's-length bargaining would produce.

The Gartenberg approach fully incorporates this understanding of the fiduciary duty as set out in Pepper and reflects § 36(b)(1)'s imposition of the burden on the plaintiff. As noted, Gartenberg insists that all relevant circumstances be taken into account, see 694 F.2d, at 929, as does § 36(b)(2), 84 Stat. 1429 (“[A]pproval by the board of directors . . . shall be given such consideration by the court as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances” (emphasis added)). And Gartenberg uses the range of fees that might result from arm's-length bargaining as the benchmark for reviewing challenged fees.

 2 

Gartenberg's approach also reflects § 36(b)'s place in the statutory scheme and, in particular, its relationship to the other protections that the Act affords investors.

 Under the Act, scrutiny of investment-adviser compensation by a fully informed mutual fund board is the “cornerstone of the . . . effort to control conflicts of interest within mutual funds.” Burks, 441 U.S., at 482, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. The Act interposes disinterested directors as “independent watchdogs” of the relationship between a mutual fund  and its adviser. Id., at 484, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (internal quotation marks omitted). To provide these directors with the information needed to judge whether an adviser's compensation is excessive, the Act requires advisers to furnish all information “reasonably . . . necessary to evaluate the terms” of the adviser's contract, 15 U.S.C § 80a-15(c), and gives the SEC the authority to enforce that requirement. See § 80a-41. Board scrutiny of adviser compensation and shareholder suits under § 36(b), 84 Stat. 1429, are mutually reinforcing but independent mechanisms for controlling conflicts. See Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 541, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (Congress intended for § 36(b) suits and directorial approval of adviser contracts to act as “independent checks on excessive fees”); Kamen, 500 U.S., at 108, 111 S. Ct. 1711, 114 L. Ed. 2d 152 (“Congress added § 36(b) to the [Act] in 1970 because it concluded that the shareholders should not have to rely solely on the fund's directors to assure reasonable adviser fees, notwithstanding the increased disinterestedness of the board” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

 In recognition of the role of the disinterested directors, the Act instructs courts to give board approval of an adviser's compensation “such consideration . . . as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances.” § 80a-35(b)(2). Cf. Burks,supra, at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (“[I]t would have been paradoxical for Congress to have been willing to rely largely upon [boards of directors as] 'watchdogs' to protect shareholder  interests and yet, where the 'watchdogs' have done precisely that, require that they be totally muzzled”).

From this formulation, two inferences may be drawn. First, a measure of deference to a board's judgment may be appropriate in some instances. Second, the appropriate measure of deference varies depending on the circumstances.

Gartenberg heeds these precepts. Gartenberg advises that  “the expertise of the independent trustees of a fund, whether they are fully informed about all facts bearing on the [investment adviser's] service and fee, and the extent of care and conscientiousness with which they perform their duties are important factors to be considered in deciding whether they and the [investment adviser] are guilty of a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of § 36(b).” 694 F.2d, at 930.

III 

While both parties in this case endorse the basic Gartenberg approach, they disagree on several important questions that warrant discussion.

The first concerns comparisons between the fees that an adviser charges a captive mutual fund and the fees that it charges its independent clients. As noted, the Gartenberg court rejected a comparison between the fees that the adviser in that case charged a money market fund and the fees that it charged a pension fund. 694 F.2d, at 930, n. 3 (noting that “[t]he nature and extent of the services required by each type of fund differ sharply”). Petitioners contend that such a comparison is appropriate, Brief for Petitioners 30-31, but respondent disagrees. Brief for Respondent 38-44.  Since the Act requires consideration of all relevant factors, 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b)(2); see also § 80a-15(c), we do not think that there can be any categorical rule regarding the comparisons of the fees  charged different types of clients. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 537, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (discussing concern with investment advisers' practice of charging higher fees to mutual funds than to their other clients). Instead, courts may  give such comparisons the weight that they merit in light of the similarities and differences between the services that the clients in question require, but courts must be wary of inapt comparisons. As the panel below noted, there may be significant differences between the services provided by an investment adviser to a mutual fund and those it provides to a pension fund which are attributable to the greater frequency of shareholder redemptions in a mutual fund, the higher turnover of mutual fund assets, the more burdensome regulatory and legal obligations, and higher marketing costs. 527 F.3d, at 634 (“Different clients call for different commitments of time”). If the services rendered are sufficiently different that a comparison is not probative, then courts must reject such a comparison. Even if the services provided and fees charged to an independent fund are relevant, courts should be mindful that the Act does not necessarily ensure fee parity between mutual funds and institutional clients, contrary to petitioners' contentions. See id., at 631(“Plaintiffs maintain that a fiduciary may charge its controlled clients no more than its independent clients”).8Comparisons with fees charged to institutional clients, therefore, will not “doo[m] [a]ny [f]und to [t]rial.” Brief for Respondent 49; see also Strougo v. BEA Assocs., 188 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (SDNY 2002) (suggesting that fee comparisons, where permitted, might produce a triable issue). First,  plaintiffs bear the burden in showing that fees are beyond the range of arm's-length bargaining. § 80a-35(b)(1). Second, a showing of relevance requires courts to assess any disparity in fees in light of the different markets for advisory services. Only where plaintiffs have shown a large disparity in fees that cannot be explained by the different services in addition to other evidence that the fee is outside the arm's-length range will trial be appropriate. Cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a; see alsoIn re Alliance Bernstein Mut. Fund Excessive Fee Litigation, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34853, 2006 WL 1520222, *2 (SDNY, May 31, 2006) (citing report finding that fee differential resulted from different services and different liabilities assumed).

By the same token,  courts should not rely too heavily on comparisons with fees charged to mutual funds by other advisers. These comparisons are problematic because these  fees, like those challenged, may not be the product of negotiations conducted at arm's length. See 537 F.3d, at 731-732 (opinion dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc); Gartenberg, supra, at 929 (“Competition between money market funds for shareholder business does not support an inference that competition must therefore also exist between [investment advisers] for fund business. The former may be vigorous even though the latter is virtually non-existent”).

Finally, a court's evaluation of an investment adviser's fiduciary duty must take into account both procedure and substance. See 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b)(2) (requiring deference to board's consideration “as is deemed appropriate under all the circumstances”); cf. Daily Income Fund, 464 U.S., at 541, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645 (“Congress intended security holder and SEC actions under § 36(b), on the one hand, and directorial approval of adviser contracts, on the other, to act as independent checks on excessive fees”). Where a board's process for negotiating and reviewing investment-adviser compensation is  robust, a reviewing court should afford commensurate deference to the outcome of the bargaining process. See Burks,441 U.S., at 484, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (unaffiliated directors serve as independent watchdogs). Thus, if the disinterested directors considered the relevant factors, their decision to approve a particular fee agreement is entitled to considerable weight, even if a court might weigh the factors differently. Cf. id., at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. This is not to deny that a fee may be excessive even if it was negotiated by a board in possession of all relevant information, but such a determination must be based on evidence that the fee “is so disproportionately large that it bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining.” Gartenberg, 694 F.2d, at 928.

In contrast,  where the board's process was deficient or the adviser withheld important information, the court must take a more rigorous look at the outcome. When an investment adviser fails to disclose material information to the  board, greater scrutiny is justified because the withheld information might have hampered the board's ability to function as “an independent check on management.” Burks, supra, at 484, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (internal quotation marks omitted). “Section 36(b) is sharply focused on the question of whether the fees themselves were excessive.” Migdal v. Rowe Price-Fleming Int'l, Inc., 248 F.3d 321, 328 (CA4 2001); see also 15 U.S.C. § 80a-35(b) (imposing a “fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of compensation for services, or of payments of a material nature” (emphasis added)). But an adviser's compliance or noncompliance with its disclosure obligations is a factor that must be considered in calibrating the degree of deference that is due a board's decision to approve an adviser's fees.

It is also important to note that  the standard for fiduciary breach under § 36(b) does not call for judicial second-guessing of informed board decisions. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645; see also Burks, 441 U.S., at 483, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404 (“Congress consciously chose to address the conflict-of-interest problem through the Act's independent-directors section, rather than through more drastic remedies”). “[P]otential conflicts [of interests] may justify some restraints upon the unfettered discretion of even disinterested mutual fund directors, particularly in their transactions with the investment adviser,” but they do not suggest that a court may supplant the judgment of disinterested directors apprised of all relevant information, without additional evidence that the fee exceeds the arm's-length range. Id., at 481, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404. In reviewing compensation under § 36(b), the Act does not require courts to engage in a precise calculation of fees representative of arm's-length bargaining. See 527 F.3d, at 633 (“Judicial price-setting does not accompany fiduciary duties”). As recounted above, Congress rejected a “reasonableness” requirement that was criticized as charging the courts with rate-setting responsibilities. See Daily Income Fund, supra, at 538-540, 104 S. Ct. 831, 78 L. Ed. 2d 645. Congress' approach recognizes that  courts are not well suited to make such precise calculations. Cf.GMC v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 308, 117 S. Ct. 811, 136 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1997) (“[T]he Court is institutionally unsuited to gather the facts upon which economic predictions can be made, and professionally untrained to make them”); Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 539, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002); see also Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 25 (CA1 1990) (opinion for the court by Breyer, C. J.) (“[H]ow is a judge or jury to determine a 'fair price'”). Gartenberg's “so disproportionately large” standard, 694 F.2d, at 928, reflects this congressional choice to “rely largely upon [independent director] 'watchdogs' to protect shareholders interests.” Burks, supra, at 485, 99 S. Ct. 1831, 60 L. Ed. 2d 404.

By focusing almost entirely on the element of disclosure, the Seventh Circuit panel erred. See 527 F.3d, at 632 (An investment adviser “must make full disclosure and play no tricks but is not subject to a cap on compensation”). The [Gartenberg standard], which the panel rejected, may lack sharp analytical clarity, but we believe that it accurately reflects the compromise that is embodied in § 36(b), and it has provided a workable standard for nearly three decades. The debate between the Seventh Circuit panel and the dissent from the denial of rehearing regarding today's mutual fund market is a matter for Congress, not the courts.

IV 

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

Since its enactment during the Civil War,  the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, has authorized both the Attorney General and private qui tam relators to recover from persons who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the United States. The Act now contains a provision barring qui tam actions based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in certain specified sources. § 3730(e)(4)(A). The question before us is whether  the reference to “administrative” reports, audits, and investigations in that provision  encompasses disclosures made in state and local sources as well as federal sources. We hold that it does.1On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119. Section 10104(j)(2) of this legislation replaces the prior version of 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4) with new language. The legislation makes no mention of retroactivity, which would be necessary for its application to pending cases given that it eliminates petitioners' claimed defense to a qui tam suit. See Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 948, 117 S. Ct. 1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997). Throughout this opinion, we use the present tense in discussing the statute as it existed at the time this case was argued.

I 

In 1995 the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) entered into contracts with two counties in North Carolina authorizing them to perform, or to hire others to perform, cleanup and repair work in areas that had suffered extensive flooding. The Federal Government agreed to shoulder 75 percent of the contract costs. Respondent Karen T. Wilson was at that time an employee of the Graham  County Soil and Conservation District, a special-purpose government body that had been delegated partial responsibility for coordinating and performing the remediation effort. Suspecting possible fraud in connection with this effort, Wilson voiced her concerns to local officials in the summer of 1995. She also sent a letter to, and had a meeting with, agents of the USDA.

Graham County officials began an investigation. An accounting firm hired by the county performed an audit and, in 1996, issued a report (Audit Report) that identified several potential irregularities in the county's administration of the contracts. Shortly thereafter, the North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources issued a report (DEHNR Report) identifying similar problems. The USDA's Office of Inspector General eventually issued a third report that contained additional findings.

In 2001 Wilson filed this action, alleging that petitioners, the Graham County and Cherokee County Soil and Water Conservation Districts and a number of local and federal officials, violated the False Claims Act (FCA) by knowingly submitting false claims for payment pursuant to the 1995 contracts. She further alleged that petitioners retaliated against her for aiding the federal investigation of those false claims. Following this Court's review of the statute of limitations applicable to Wilson's retaliation claim, Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 125 S. Ct. 2444, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390 (2005), the Court of Appeals ordered that that claim be dismissed as time barred. 424 F.3d 437 (CA4 2005). On remand, the District Court subsequently dismissed Wilson's qui tam action for lack of jurisdiction. App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a-105a. The court found that Wilson had failed to refute that her action was based upon allegations publicly disclosed in the Audit Report and the DEHNR Report. Id., at 95a-98a. Those reports, the District Court determined, constituted “administrative . . . report[s], . . . audit[s], or investigation[s]” within the  meaning of the FCA's public disclosure bar, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(A). 

The Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the District Court because the reports had been generated by state and local entities. “[O]nly federal administrative reports, audits or investigations,” the Fourth Circuit concluded, “qualify as public disclosures under the FCA.” 528 F.3d 292, 301 (2008) (emphasis added). The Circuits having divided over this issue,2Compare 528 F.3d, at 301-307 (limiting this portion of the public disclosure bar to federal sources), and United States ex rel. Dunleavy v. County of Delaware, 123 F.3d 734, 745-746 (CA3 1997) (same), with United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470 F.3d 914, 918-919 (CA9 2006) (concluding that state and local sources may qualify), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1165, 128 S. Ct. 1119, 169 L. Ed. 2d 948 (2008), and Battle v. Board of Regents for State of Ga., 468 F.3d 755, 762 (CA11 2006)(per curiam) (assuming without analysis that state audits may qualify). The Eighth Circuit appears to have taken a “middle road” on this issue, 528 F.3d, at 301, holding that disclosures made in nonfederal forums may count as “ 'administrative . . . report[s]' ” or “ 'audit[s]' ” under § 3730(e)(4)(A) in some instances, as when they relate to “a cooperative federal-state program through which the federal government provides financial assistance,” Hays v. Hoffman, 325 F.3d 982, 989, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 877, 124 S. Ct. 277, 157 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2003). we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 557 U.S. 918, 129 S. Ct. 2824, 174 L. Ed. 2d 551 (2009).

II 

We have examined the FCA's qui tam provisions in several recent opinions.3See, e.g.,Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 127 S. Ct. 1397, 167 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2007) (construing § 3730(e)(4)(A)'s original source exception); Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S. 119, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2003) (holding that local governments are subject to qui tam liability); Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 120 S. Ct. 1858, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2000) (holding that States are not subject to private FCA actions). At issue in this case is the FCA's public disclosure bar, which deprives courts of jurisdiction over qui tam suits when the relevant information has already entered the public domain through certain channels. The statute contains three categories of jurisdiction-stripping disclosures. Following the example of the Court of Appeals, see 528 F.3d, at 300-301, we have inserted Arabic numerals to identify these categories:

“No court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions [1] in a criminal, civil, or administrative  hearing, [2] in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office [(GAO)] report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or [3] from the news media, unless the action is brought by the Attorney General or the person bringing the action is an original source[4A separate statutory provision defines an “original source” as “an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the Government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.” 31 U.S.C. § 3730(e)(4)(B).] of the information.” § 3730(e)(4)(A) (footnote omitted).

This dispute turns on the meaning of the adjective “administrative” in the second category  (Category 2): whether it embraces only forums that are federal in nature, as respondent alleges, or whether it extends to disclosures made in state and local sources such as the DEHNR Report and the Audit Report, as petitioners allege.

In debating this question, petitioners have relied primarily on the statute's text whereas respondent and the Solicitor General, as her amicus, have relied heavily on considerations of history and policy. Although there is some overlap among the three types of argument, it is useful to discuss them separately. We begin with the text.

 III 

The term “administrative” “may, in various contexts, bear a range of related meanings,” Chandler v. Judicial Council of Tenth Circuit, 398 U.S. 74, 103, n. 8, 90 S. Ct. 1648, 26 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in denial of writ), pertaining to private bodies as  well as to governmental bodies. When used to modify the nouns “report, hearing, audit, or investigation,” in the context of a statutory provision about “the public disclosure” of fraud on the United States, the term is most naturally read to describe the activities of governmental agencies. See Black's Law Dictionary 49 (9th ed. 2009) (hereinafter Black's) (defining “administration,” “[i]n public law, [as] the practical management and direction of the executive department and its agencies”). Given that “administrative” is not itself modified by “federal,” there is no immediately apparent textual basis for excluding the activities of state and local agencies (or their contractors) from its ambit. As the Court of Appeals recognized,  “the statute by its express terms does not limit its reach to federal administrative reports or investigations.” 528 F.3d, at 301. “[T]here is nothing inherently federal about the word 'administrative,' and Congress did not define the term in the FCA.” Id., at 302.

The Court of Appeals' conclusion that “administrative” nevertheless reaches only federal sources rested on its application of the interpretive maxim noscitur a sociis. See id., at 302-305. This maxim, literally translated as “ 'it is known by its associates,' ” Black's 1160, counsels lawyers reading statutes that “a word may be known by the company it keeps,” Russell Motor Car Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 514, 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778, 58 Ct. Cl. 708 (1923). All participants in this litigation acknowledge that the terms “congressional” and “[GAO]” are federal in nature; Congress is the Legislative Branch of the Federal Government,5See U.S. Const., Art. I, § 1; id.,§ 4, cl. 1 (distinguishing “State . . . Legislature[s]” from “the Congress”). and the GAO is a federal agency.6The statute refers to the GAO, mistakenly, as the “Government Accounting Office.” It is undisputed that the intended referent was the General Accounting Office, now renamed the Government Accountability Office. See 31 U.S.C. § 3730, p. 254, n. 2 (compiler's note); 528 F.3d 292, 300, n. 4 (CA4 2008); United States ex rel. Mistick PBT v. Housing Authority of Pittsburgh, 186 F.3d 376, 387 (CA3 1999) (Alito, J.), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1018, 120 S. Ct. 1418, 146 L. Ed. 2d 310 (2000); see also Mistick, 186 F.3d, at 398 (Becker, C. J., dissenting) (noting that courts have “frequently” made the same scrivener's error). We have described the GAO as “an independent agency within the Legislative Branch that exists in large part to serve the needs of Congress.” Bowsher v. Merck & Co., 460 U.S. 824, 844, 103 S. Ct. 1587, 75 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1983). Relying on our opinions in S. D. Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Environmental Protection, 547 U.S. 370, 126 S. Ct. 1843, 164 L. Ed. 2d 625 (2006), and Beecham v. United States, 511 U.S. 368, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383 (1994), the Court of Appeals reasoned that “the placement of 'administrative' squarely in the middle of a list of obviously federal sources strongly suggests that 'administrative' should likewise be restricted to federal administrative reports, hearings, audits, or investigations.” 528 F.3d, at 302. In so holding, the Court of Appeals embraced what we might call the Sandwich Theory of the Third Circuit. Both courts “ 'f[ou]nd it hard to believe that the drafters of this provision intended the word “administrative” to refer to both state and federal reports when it lies sandwiched between  modifiers which are unquestionably federal in character.' ” Ibid.(quoting United States ex rel. Dunleavy v. County of Delaware, 123 F.3d 734, 745 (CA3 1997)).

We find this use of noscitur a sociis unpersuasive. A list of three items, each quite distinct from the other no matter how construed, is too short to be particularly illuminating. Although this list may not be “completely disjunctive,” 528 F.3d, at 302 --it refers to “congressional, administrative, or [GAO]” sources, § 3730(e)(4)(A), rather than “congressional, or administrative, or [GAO]” sources--neither is it completely harmonious. The substantive connection, or fit, between the terms “congressional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” is not so tight or so self-evident as to demand that we “rob” any one of them “of its independent and ordinary significance.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 338-339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979); see also Russell, 261 U.S., at 519, 43 S. Ct. 428, 67 L. Ed. 778 ( “That a word may be known by the company it keeps is . . . not an invariable rule, for the word may have a character of its own not to be submerged by its association”). The adjectives in Category 2 are too few and too disparate to qualify as “a string of statutory terms,” S. D. Warren Co., 547 U.S., at 378, 126 S. Ct. 1843, 164 L. Ed. 2d 625, or “items in a list,” Beecham, 511 U.S., at 371, 114 S. Ct. 1669, 128 L. Ed. 2d 383, in the sense that we used those phrases in the cited cases.7In Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859, 1961-2 C.B. 254 (1961), the Court applied the noscitur a sociis maxim in construing a statutory provision that referred to “ '[i]ncome resulting from exploration, discovery, or prospecting,' ” id., at 305, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859 (quoting § 456(a)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Justice Sotomayor contends that “the three terms in Category 2 are no more 'distinct' or 'disparate' than the phrase at issue in Jarecki.” Post, at 305-306, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 243 (dissenting opinion) (citation omitted). We disagree. Whether taken in isolation or in context, the phrase “congressional, administrative, or GAO” is not as cohesive as the phrase “exploration, discovery, or prospecting.” That is one reason why noscitur a sociis proved illuminating in Jarecki, and why it is less helpful in this case. On their “face,” the terms “exploration,” “discovery,” and “prospecting” all describe processes of searching, seeking, speculating; the centrality of such activities to “the oil and gas and mining industries” gave a clue that it was those industries Congress had in mind when it drafted the provision. 367 U.S., at 307, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859 (internal quotation marks omitted). The terms “congressional,” “administrative,” and “GAO” do not share any comparable core of meaning--or indeed any “common feature” at all, post, at 306, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 243--apart from a governmental connotation. It takes the Sandwich Theory to graft a federal limitation onto “administrative.”

More importantly, we need to evaluate “administrative” within the larger scheme of the public disclosure bar. Both parties acknowledge, as they must, that  “[s]tatutory language has meaning only in context,” Graham County Soil, 545 U.S., at 415, 125 S. Ct. 2444, 162 L. Ed. 2d 390; where they differ is in determining the relevant context. The Sandwich Theory presupposes that Category 2 is the only piece of § 3730(e)(4)(A) that matters. We agree with petitioners, however, that all of the sources listed in § 3730(e)(4)(A) provide interpretive guidance. All of these sources drive at the same end: specifying the types of disclosures that can foreclose qui tam actions. In light of the public disclosure bar's grammatical structure, it may be convenient and even clarifying to parse the list of sources into three categories. But it does not follow that we should treat these categories as islands unto themselves.  Courts have a “duty to construe statutes, not isolated provisions.” Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 568, 115 S. Ct. 1061, 131 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1995).

When we consider the entire text of the public disclosure bar, the case for limiting “administrative” to federal sources becomes significantly weaker. The “news media” referenced in Category 3 plainly have a broader sweep. The Federal Government funds certain media outlets, and certain private outlets have a national focus; but no one contends that Category 3 is limited to these sources. There is likewise no textual basis for assuming that the “criminal, civil, or administrative hearing[s]” listed in Category 1 must be federal hearings.8A number of lower courts have concluded that, as used in Category 1, “ 'hearing' is roughly synonymous with 'proceeding.' ” United States ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F.3d 645, 652, 304 U.S. App. D.C. 347 (CADC 1994); see also 1 J. Boese, Civil False Claims and Qui Tam Actions § 4.02[B], p. 4-59, and n. 231 (3d ed. 2006) (hereinafter Boese); C. Sylvia, The False Claims Act: Fraud Against the Government § 11:35, p. 642 (2004) (hereinafter Sylvia). Of the numerous types of sources that serve a common function in § 3730(e)(4)(A), then, only two are distinctly federal in nature, while one (the news media) is distinctly nonfederal in nature.

If the Court of Appeals was correct that the term “administrative” encompasses state and local sources in Category 1, see 528 F.3d, at 303, it becomes even harder to see why the term would not do the same in Category 2. See Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243, 93 S. Ct. 477, 34 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1972) (“[A] legislative body generally uses a particular word with a consistent meaning in a given context”). Respondent and the Solicitor General assert that § 3730(e)(4)(A)'s two references to “administrative” can be distinguished because Category 1 is best understood to refer to adjudicative proceedings, whereas Category 2 is best understood to refer to legislative or quasi-legislative activities such as rulemaking, oversight, and investigations. See Brief for Respondent 16-18; Brief  for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-26 (hereinafter Brief for United States). Yet even if this reading were correct, state and local administrative reports, hearings, audits, and investigations of a legislative-type character are presumably just as public, and just as likely to put the Federal Government on notice of a potential fraud, as state and local administrative hearings of an adjudicatory character.9See Bly-Magee, 470 F.3d, at 918 (“Indeed, the statute would seem to be inconsistent if it included state and local administrative hearings as sources of public disclosures [in Category 1] and then, in the next breath, excluded state administrative reports as sources”); In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litig., 467 F. Supp. 2d 1117, 1143-1144 (Wyo. 2006) (“There is no reason to conclude that Congress intended to limit administrative reports, audits, and investigations to federal actions, while simultaneously allowing all state and local civil litigation, state and local administrative hearings, and state and local news media to be treated as public disclosures. To interpret the statute so narrowly would have the anomalous result of allowing public disclosure status to the most obscure local news report and the most obscure state and local civil lawsuit or administrative hearing, but denying public disclosure status to a formal public report of a state government agency”).

 Respondent and the Solicitor General try to avoid this inference, and to turn a weakness into a strength, by further averring that the sources listed in Category 1 are themselves only federal. See Brief for Respondent 23-24; Brief for United States 25-26. No court has ever taken such a view of these sources. See 528 F.3d, at 303 (citing cases from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits  and stating that “[t]he courts have easily concluded that [Category 1] applies to state-level hearings”); Sylvia § 11:37, at 643, n. 1 (citing additional cases).10Following the Court of Appeals, see 528 F.3d, at 303, respondent asserts that only the Ninth Circuit, in A-1 Ambulance Serv., Inc. v. California, 202 F.3d 1238, 1244 (2000), has explicitly considered and rejected the argument that Category 1 is limited to federal sources. Brief for Respondent 23-24. At least one other Circuit, however, has done the same, see United States ex rel. Hafter v. Spectrum Emergency Care, Inc., 190 F.3d 1156, 1161, n. 6 (CA10 1999), and no lower court, as far as we are aware, has so much as suggested that an alternative construction might be viable. Moreover, the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuit cases cited by the Court of Appeals postdate A-1 Ambulance and Dunleavy, 123 F.3d 734, both of which put litigants and courts on notice of the possibility that § 3730(e)(4)(A) might be limited to federal sources. The arguments in favor of reading  a federal limitation into Category 1 are supported, if at all, by legislative history and policy; they find no support in the statute's text.

Moving from the narrow lens of the Sandwich Theory to a bird's-eye view, respondent and the Solicitor General also maintain that the “exclusively federal focus” of the FCA counsels against reading the public disclosure bar to encompass nonfederal sources. Brief for Respondent 10, 18; Brief for United States 13. The FCA undoubtedly has a federal focus. But so does every other federal statute. And as respondent and the Solicitor General elsewhere acknowledge, quite a few aspects of the FCA, including a reference to “administrative” proceedings in § 3733(l)(7)(A)11On its face, § 3733(l)(7)(A) is silent as to whether it includes nonfederal proceedings. Respondent and the Solicitor General suggest that it does, though they fairly argue that this provision, relating to civil investigative demands, has little if any relevance to the case at hand. See Brief for Respondent 21, n. 8; Brief for United States 31-32. and the reference to “news media” in § 3730(e)(4)(A) itself, are not just federal. In any event, the “federal focus” of the statute, as a whole, does not shine light on the specific question whether the public disclosure bar extends to certain nonfederal contexts.  It is the fact of “public disclosure”--not Federal Government creation or receipt--that is the touchstone of § 3730(e)(4)(A).

Respondent and the Solicitor General make one last argument grounded in the statutory text: It would be anomalous, they say, for state and local administrative reports to count as public disclosures, when state legislative reports do not. See Brief for Respondent 15; Brief for United States 15-16. Yet neither respondent nor the Solicitor General disputes the contention of petitioners and their amici that, at the time the public disclosure bar was enacted in 1986, Congress rarely gave state legislatures a meaningful role in administering or overseeing federally funded programs. See Brief for Petitioners 36-39; Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 8-13. As in the instant case, the Federal Government was far more likely to enter into contracts with, and to provide moneys to, state and local executive agencies. Whether or not state legislative sources should have been included in § 3730(e)(4)(A), their exclusion therefore carries no clear implications for the status of state administrative sources.

In sum, although the term “administrative” may be sandwiched in Category 2 between terms that are federal in nature, those terms are themselves sandwiched between phrases that have been generally understood to include nonfederal sources; and one of those phrases, in  Category 1, contains the exact term that is the subject of our inquiry. These textual clues negate the force of the noscitur a sociis canon, as it was applied by the Court of Appeals.12The Court of Appeals repeatedly referred to the three categories in § 3730(e)(4)(A) as “clauses.” See 528 F.3d, at 300-305. Were they in fact clauses rather than prepositional phrases, reliance on noscitur a sociis might have been supported by one of our earliest cases using that term, Watson v. Mercer, 33 U.S. 88, 8 Pet. 88, 105, 8 L. Ed. 876 (1834) (Reporter's statement of the case), which suggested that “different clauses of the same sentence” should be presumed “to embrace the subject matter of the sentence.” The Court of Appeals' mistaken reference to “clauses” is of course less significant than its failure to treat the public disclosure bar as an integrated whole. Cf. Stevens, The Shakespeare Canon of Statutory Construction, 140 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1373, 1376 (1992) (emphasizing importance of reading provisions in their broader statutory context). We are not persuaded that the associates with which “administrative” keeps company in § 3730(e)(4)(A) endow it with an exclusively federal character.

IV 

As originally enacted, the FCA did not limit the sources from which a relator could acquire the information to bring a qui tam action. In United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (1943), we upheld the relator's recovery even though he had discovered the fraud by reading a federal criminal indictment--a quintessential “parasitic” suit. Id., at 545-548, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443; see id., at 545, 63 S. Ct. 379, 87 L. Ed. 443 (“Even if, as the government suggests, the petitioner has contributed nothing to the discovery of this crime, he has contributed much to accomplishing one of the purposes for which the Act was passed”). Congress promptly reacted to that decision by amending the statute to preclude qui tam actions “based upon evidence or information in the possession of the United States, or any agency, officer or employee thereof, at the time such suit was brought.” Act of Dec. 23, 1943, 57 Stat. 609 (codified at 31 U.S.C. § 232(C) (1946 ed.)). This amendment erected what came to be known as a Government knowledge bar: “[O]nce the United States learned of a false claim, only the Government could assert its rights under the FCA against the false claimant.” Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939, 949, 117 S. Ct. 1871, 138 L. Ed. 2d 135 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the years that followed the 1943 amendment, the volume and efficacy of qui tam litigation dwindled. “Seeking the golden mean between adequate incentives for whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information and discouragement of opportunistic plaintiffs who have no significant information to contribute of their own,” United States ex rel. Springfield Terminal R. Co. v. Quinn, 14 F.3d 645, 649, 304 U.S. App. D.C. 347 (CADC 1994), Congress overhauled the statute once again in 1986 “to make the FCA a 'more useful tool against fraud in modern times,' ” Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S. 119, 133, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2003) (quoting S. Rep. No. 99-345, p. 2 (1986) (hereinafter S. Rep.)).

The present text of § 3730(e)(4) was enacted in 1986 as part of this larger reform. Congress apparently concluded that a total bar on qui tam actions based on information already in the Government's possession thwarted a significant number of potentially valuable claims. Rather than simply repeal the Government knowledge bar, however, Congress replaced  it with the public disclosure bar in an effort to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits such as the one in Hess. How exactly § 3730(e)(4) came to strike this balance in the way it did is a matter of considerable uncertainty. The House and Senate Judiciary Committees each reported bills that contained very different public disclosure bars from the one that emerged in the Statutes at Large; the Senate bill, for example, did not include the words “administrative,” “audit,” or “investigation” in its version of Category 2, nor did it contain an original source exception. See S. Rep., at 42-43 (text of proposed § 3730(e)(4)).13See also H. R. Rep. No. 99-660, pp. 2-3 (1986) (text of proposed § 3730(b)(5)). The public disclosure bar that was enacted more closely resembles the version in the Senate bill.

In respondent and her amici's view, this background counsels in favor of an exclusively federal interpretation of “administrative” for three separate reasons. First, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar suggests that Congress intended such a result. Second, a major aim of the 1986 amendments was to limit the scope of the Government knowledge bar, and “[c]onstruing [ § 3730(e)(4)(A)] as limited to disclosures in federal proceedings furthers Congress's purpose 'to encourage more private enforcement suits.' ” Brief for United States 21 (quoting S. Rep., at 23-24). Third, whereas federal administrative proceedings can be presumed to provide the Attorney General with a fair opportunity to decide whether to bring an FCA action based on revelations made therein, the Attorney General is much less likely to learn of fraud disclosed in state proceedings. Respondent and her amici further maintain that it would be perverse to include nonfederal sources in Category 2, as local governments would then be able to shield themselves from qui tam liability by discretely disclosing evidence of fraud in “public” reports.14State governments are already shielded from qui tam liability under our precedent. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 120 S. Ct. 1858, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836.

These arguments are reasonable so far as they go, but they do not go very far. As many have observed, the drafting history of the public disclosure bar raises more questions than it answers.15See, e.g.,Dunleavy, 123 F.3d, at 745 (“Congress gave us little specific guidance to determine the scope of public disclosure sources”); United States ex rel. Stinson, Lyons, Gerlin & Bustamante, P. A. v. Prudential Ins. Co., 944 F.2d 1149, 1154 (CA3 1991) (“The bill that eventuated in the 1986 amendments underwent substantial revisions during its legislative path. This provides ample opportunity to search the legislative history and find some support somewhere for almost any construction of the many ambiguous terms in the final version”); id., at 1163 (Scirica, J., dissenting) (“One difficulty in interpreting the 1986 amendments is that Congress was never completely clear about what kind of 'parasitic' suits it was attempting to avoid”); Boese § 4.02[A], at 4-46 (“The present Section 3730(e)(4) was enacted . . . without explanation by Congress”); id., § 4.02[A], at 4-47 to 4-48 (“[A]pplicable legislative history explaining versions [of § 3730(e)(4)] not adopted is of little help in deciphering this provision. Because Section 3730(e)(4) was drafted subsequent to the completion of the House and Senate Committee reports on the proposed False Claims Act Amendments, those reports, which contained discussion of altogether different bars, cannot be used in interpreting it. And the sponsors' interpretations of the provision ultimately enacted . . . are spare, often incorrect, and wide-ranging enough to provide some support for almost any construction of its many ambiguities”). Significant substantive changes--including the introduction of the term we are construing in this case--were inserted without floor debate, as “technical” amendments. That the original Senate bill mentioned only congressional and GAO  sources in Category 2 is therefore of little moment. Neither the House nor the Senate Committee Report explained why a federal limitation would be appropriate, and the subsequent addition of “administrative” sources to this Category might be taken as a sign that such a limitation was rejected by the full Chambers.16Justice Sotomayor makes a valiant effort to unearth from the legislative history “the balance Congress evidently sought to achieve through the 1986 amendments.” Post, at 312, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 247. But her reconstruction of the history assigns little weight to the side of this balance preserved by the public disclosure bar: the desire to minimize “the potential for parasitic lawsuits by those who learn of the fraud through public channels and seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to the exposure of the fraud,” United States ex rel. Doe v. John Doe Corp., 960 F.2d 318, 319 (CA2 1992). And her narrative contains no account of why Category 2 emerged in the form that it did. Any such account would necessarily be an exercise in speculation, as the record is silent on the matter. In our view, neither the general trajectory of 20th-century FCA reform nor the specific statements made during the 1986 legislative process clearly point one way or the other on the question before us.

 Respondent and her amici place particular emphasis on a remark made by the lead sponsor of the Senate bill, Senator Grassley. See Brief for Respondent 29; Brief for United States 20; Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as Amicus Curiae 13-14; Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 30-31. In a floor statement, Grassley said that “the term 'Government' in the definition of original source is meant to include any Government source of disclosures cited in [the public disclosure bar]; that is, Government includes Congress, the General Accounting Office, any executive or independent agency as well as all other governmental bodies that may have publicly disclosed the allegations.” 132 Cong. Rec. 20536 (1986). Yet even if a single sentence by a single legislator were entitled to any meaningful weight, Senator Grassley's remark merely begs the question before us. His formulation fails to indicate whether the “other governmental bodies” may be state or local bodies. It also turns on a term, “Government” with a capital “G,” that does not appear in the codified version of the public disclosure bar, which Congress subsequently revised in numerous respects prior to passage.

There is, in fact, only one item in the legislative record that squarely corroborates respondent's reading of the statute: a letter sent by the primary sponsors of the 1986 amendments to the Attorney General in 1999. See 145 Cong. Rec. 16032 (1999) (reproducing text of letter in which Rep. Berman and Sen. Grassley state: “We did intend, and any fair reading of the statute will confirm, that the disclosure must be in a federal criminal, civil or administrative hearing. Disclosure in a state proceeding of any kind should not be a bar to a subsequent qui tam suit”). Needless to say, this letter does not qualify as legislative “history,” given that it was written 13 years after the amendments were enacted. It is consequently of scant or no value for our purposes.17 See Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 118, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1980); Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557, 580, n. 10, 126 S. Ct. 2749, 165 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2006); see also Hafter, 190 F.3d, at 1161, n. 6 (refusing to credit the Berman-Grassley letter in interpreting the public disclosure bar). Respondent and her amici additionally contend that the enactment of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (PFCRA), 100 Stat. 1934 (codified at 31 U.S.C. § 3801 et seq.), shortly before the enactment of the FCA amendments supports their reading of the latter. See Brief for Respondent 30-33; Brief for United States 14-15; Brief for Taxpayers Against Fraud Education Fund as Amicus Curiae 28-29. Yet while “there is no question that the PFCRA was designed to operate in tandem with the FCA,” Stevens, 529 U.S., at 786, n. 17, 120 S. Ct. 1858, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, or that the PFCRA is addressed to federal administrative agencies, there is also no explicit evidence to suggest that Congress intended to limit Category 2's reference to “administrative” sources to the same set of agencies. The FCA's public disclosure bar serves a distinct function not replicated in the PFCRA; the text of the public disclosure bar contains no reference to the PFCRA; and no Member of Congress, so far as we are aware, articulated any such intent.

We do not doubt that Congress passed the 1986 amendments to the FCA “to strengthen the Government's hand in fighting false claims,” Cook County, 538 U.S., at 133-134, 123 S. Ct. 1239, 155 L. Ed. 2d 247, and “to encourage more private enforcement suits,” S. Rep., at 23-24. It is equally beyond cavil, however, that Congress passed the public disclosure bar to bar a subset of those suits that it deemed unmeritorious or downright harmful. The question before us concerns the precise scope of that subset; and on this matter, the record is all but opaque. While “the absence of specific legislative history in no way modifies the conventional judicial duty to give faithful meaning to the language Congressadopted in the light of the evident legislative purpose in enacting the law in question,” United States v. Bornstein, 423 U.S. 303, 310, 96 S. Ct. 523, 46 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1976), there is no “evident legislative purpose” to guide our resolution of the discrete issue that confronts us.

V 

Respondent and her amici likewise fail to prove their case that petitioners' reading of the statute will lead to results that Congress could not have intended. Their argument rests on an empirical proposition: “While federal inquiries and their outcomes are readily available to Department of Justice [(DOJ)] attorneys, many state and local reports and investigations never come to the attention of federal authorities.” Brief for United States 22; see also 528 F.3d, at 306 (“Because the federal government is unlikely to learn about state and local investigations, a large number of fraudulent claims against the government would go unremedied without the financial incentives offered by the qui tam provisions of the FCA”). This proposition is not implausible, but it is sheer conjecture. Numerous federal investigations may be occurring at any given time, and DOJ attorneys may not reliably learn about their findings. DOJ attorneys may learn about quite a few state and local inquiries, especially when the inquiries are conducted pursuant to a joint federal-state program financed in part by federal dollars, such as the program at issue in this case.18In some instances, federal law dictates that state and local governments receiving federal funds perform an audit of their programs. See 31 U.S.C. § 7502(a)(1)(B) (requiring nonfederal entities that expend federal awards above a certain amount to “undergo a single audit” in accordance with specified conditions); Brief for State of Pennsylvania et al. as Amici Curiae 7-10 (discussing the Single Audit Act of 1984). It bears mention that, to the extent one is worried about Federal Government ignorance of state and local antifraud efforts, see post, at 312-313, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 247 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), today's ruling may induce federal authorities to pay closer attention to such efforts going forward. Just how accessible to the Attorney General a typical state or local source will be, as compared to a federal source, is an open question. And it is not even the right question. The statutory touchstone, once again, is whether the allegations of fraud have been “public[ly] disclos[ed],” § 3730(e)(4)(A), not  whether they have landed on the desk of a DOJ lawyer.

Respondent's argument also gives insufficient weight to Congress' decision to bar qui tam actions based on disclosures “from the news media.” Ibid. Because there was no such bar prior to 1986, the addition of the news media as a jurisdiction-stripping category forecloses the suggestion that the 1986 amendments implemented a single-minded intent to increase the availability of qui tam litigation. And since the “news media” include a large number of local newspapers and radio stations, this category likely describes a multitude of sources that would seldom come to the attention of the Attorney General.

As for respondent and her amici's concern that local governments will insulate themselves from qui tam liability “through careful, low key 'disclosures' ” of potential fraud, Brief for American Center for Law and Justice as Amicus Curiae 17, this argument rests not just on speculation but indeed on rather strained speculation. Any such disclosure would not immunize the local government from FCA liability in an action brought by the United States, see Rockwell Int'l Corp. v. United States, 549 U.S. 457, 478, 127 S. Ct. 1397, 167 L. Ed. 2d 190 (2007) --and to the contrary it could tip off the Attorney General that such an action might be fruitful. It seems to us that petitioners have the more clear-eyed view when they assert that, “[g]iven the fact that the submission of a false claim to the United States subjects a defendant to criminal liability, fines, debarment, treble damages and attorneys' fees, no rational entity would prepare a report that self-discloses fraud with the sole purpose of cutting off qui tam actions.” Reply Brief for Petitioners 19; see also United States ex rel. Bly-Magee v. Premo, 470 F.3d 914, 919 (CA9 2006) (“The fear [of self-insulating disclosures] is unfounded in general because it is unlikely that an agency trying to cover up its fraud would reveal the requisite 'allegations or transactions' underlying the fraud in a public document”).19Petitioners and their amici also counter with public policy arguments of their own. Under the Court of Appeals' reading of the statute, they allege, there is an increased likelihood that parasitic relators will beat more deserving relators to the courthouse, Brief for Petitioners 31, and that state and local governments will find their antifraud investigations impeded, or will decline to conduct such investigations in the first place, on account of “opportunistic potential relators trolling state records and reports, available to the public,” in search of a qui tam claim, Brief for Commonwealth of Pennsylvania et al. as Amici Curiae 11.

Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that Congress carefully preserved the rights of the most deserving qui tam plaintiffs: those whistle-blowers who qualify as original sources. Notwithstanding public disclosure of the allegations made by a qui tam plaintiff, her case may go forward if she is “an original source of the information.” § 3730(e)(4)(A). It is therefore flat wrong to suggest that a finding for petitioners will “ 'in effect return us to the unduly restrictive “government knowledge” standard' ” that prevailed prior to 1986. Brief for United States 31 (quotingDunleavy, 123 F.3d, at 746); see Brief for Respondent 34 (asserting that “petitioners' construction would reimpose a form of the 'government knowledge' bar” (capitalization omitted)). Today's ruling merely confirms that disclosures made in one type of context--a state or local report, audit, or investigation--may trigger the public disclosure bar. It  has no bearing on disclosures made in other contexts, and it leaves intact the ability of original sources to prosecute qui tam actions irrespective of the state of Government knowledge. Whether respondent can qualify as an “original source,” as that term is defined in § 3730(e)(4), is one of many issues that remain open on remand.

VI 

Respondent and the Solicitor General have given numerous reasons why they believe their reading of the FCA moves it closer to the golden mean between an inadequate and an excessive scope for private enforcement. Congress may well have endorsed those views in its recent amendment to the public disclosure bar. See n. 1, supra. With respect to the version of § 3730(e)(4)(A) that is before us, however, we conclude that the term “administrative” in Category 2 is not limited to federal sources.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioner Jose Padilla, a native of Honduras, has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for more than 40 years. Padilla served  this Nation with honor as a member of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War. He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.1Padilla's crime, like virtually every drug offense except for only the most insignificant marijuana offenses, is a deportable offense under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i).

In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he “ 'did not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.' " 253 S. W. 3d 482, 483 (Ky. 2008). Padilla relied on his counsel's erroneous advice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made his deportation virtually mandatory. He alleges that he would have insisted on going to trial if he had not received incorrect advice from his attorney.

Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme Court of Kentuckydenied Padilla postconviction relief without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing. The court held that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant from erroneous advice about deportation because it is merely a “collateral” consequence  of his conviction. Id., at 485. In its view, neither counsel's failure to advise petitioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel's incorrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.

We granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1317, 173 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009), to decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla's counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation. Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that we do not address.

I 

The landscape of federal immigration law has changed dramatically over the last 90 years. While once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation. The “drastic measure” of deportation or removal, Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 10, 68 S. Ct. 374, 92 L. Ed. 433 (1948), is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.

The Nation's first 100 years was “a period of unimpeded immigration.” C. Gordon & H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure § 1.2a, p. 5 (1959). An early effort to empower the President to order the deportation of those immigrants he “judge[d] dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,” Act of June 25, 1798, ch. 58, 1 Stat. 571, was short lived and unpopular. Gordon § 1.2, at 5. It was not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute barring convicts and prostitutes from entering the country, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477. Gordon § 1.2b, at 6. In 1891, Congress added to the list of excludable persons those “who have been convicted of a felony or other infamous  crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.” Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.2In 1907, Congress expanded the class of excluded persons to include individuals who “admit” to having committed a crime of moral turpitude. Act of Feb. 20, 1907, ch. 1134, § 2, 34 Stat. 899.

The Immigration Act of 1917 (1917 Act) brought “radical changes” to our law. S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 54-55 (1950). For the first time in our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens deportable based on conduct committed on American soil. Id., at 55. Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the deportation of “any alien who is hereafter sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States . . . .” 39 Stat. 889. And § 19 also rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who commit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time after entry. Ibid.Congress did not, however, define the term “moral turpitude.”

While the 1917 Act was “radical” because it authorized deportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the Act also included a critically important procedural protection to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the time of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sentencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had the power to make a recommendation “that such alien shall not be deported.” Id., at 890.3As enacted, the statute provided:  “That the provision of this section respecting the deportation of aliens convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude shall not apply to one who has been pardoned, nor shall such deportation be made or directed if the court, or judge thereof, sentencing such alien for such crime shall, at the time of imposing judgment or passing sentence or within thirty days thereafter, . . . make a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor that such alien shall not be deported in pursuance of this Act.” 1917 Act, 39 Stat. 889-890. This provision was codified in 8 U.S.C. § 1251(b) (1994 ed.)(transferred to § 1227 (2006 ed.)). The judge's nondeportation recommendation was binding on the Secretary of Labor and, later, the Attorney General after control of immigration removal matters was transferred from the former to the latter. See Janvier v. United States, 793 F.2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). This procedure, known as a judicial recommendation  against deportation, or JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to prevent deportation; the statute was “consistently . . . interpreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority to decide whether a particular conviction should be disregarded as a basis for deportation,” Janvier v. United States, 793 F.2d 449, 452 (CA2 1986). Thus, from 1917 forward, there was no such creature as an automatically deportable offense. Even as the class of deportable offenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate unjust results on a case-by-case basis.

Although narcotics offenses--such as the offense at issue in this case--provided a distinct basis for deportation as early as 1922,4Congressfirst identified narcotics offenses as a special category of crimes triggering deportation in the 1922 Narcotic Drug Act. Act of May 26, 1922, ch. 202, 42 Stat. 596. After the 1922 Act took effect, there was some initial confusion over whether a narcotics offense also had to be a crime of moral turpitude for an individual to be deportable. See Weedin v. Moy Fat, 8 F.2d 488, 489 (CA9 1925) (holding that an individual who committed narcotics offense was not deportable because offense did not involve moral turpitude). However, lower courts eventually agreed that the narcotics offense provision was “special,” Chung Que Fong v. Nagle, 15 F.2d 789, 790 (CA9 1926); thus, a narcotics offense did not need also to be a crime of moral turpitude (or to satisfy other requirements of the 1917 Act) to trigger deportation. See United States ex rel. Grimaldi v. Ebey, 12 F.2d 922, 923 (CA7 1926); Todaro v. Munster, 62 F.2d 963, 964 (CA10 1933). the JRAD procedure was generally available  to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions. See United States v. O'Rourke, 213 F.2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954). Except for “technical, inadvertent and insignificant violations of the laws relating to narcotics,” ibid., it appears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes involving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act's broad JRAD provision. See ibid. (recognizing that until 1952 a JRAD in a narcotics  case “was effective to prevent deportation” (citing Dang Nam v. Bryan, 74 F.2d 379, 380-381 (CA9 1934))).

In light of both the steady expansion of deportable offenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD, it is unsurprising that, in the wake of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the Second Circuit held that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see Janvier,793 F.2d 449. See also United States v. Castro, 26 F.3d 557 (CA5 1994). In its view, seeking a JRAD was “part of the sentencing” process, Janvier, 793 F.2d, at 452, even if deportation itself is a civil action. Under the Second Circuit's reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a noncitizen's ability to remain in the country was a central issue to be resolved during the sentencing process--not merely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel's duty to provide effective representation.

However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our law. Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),5The INA separately codified the moral turpitude offense provision and the narcotics offense provision within 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a) (1994 ed.) under subsections (a)(4) and (a)(11), respectively. See 66 Stat. 201, 204, 206. The JRAD procedure, codified in 8 U.S.C. § 1251(b) (1994 ed.), applied only to the “provisions of subsection (a)(4),” the crimes-of-moral-turpitude provision. 66 Stat. 208; see United States v. O'Rourke, 213 F.2d 759, 762 (CA8 1954) (recognizing that, under the 1952 INA, narcotics offenses were no longer eligible for JRADs). and in 1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050. In 1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General's authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation, 110 Stat. 3009-596, an authority that had been exercised to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens during the 5-year period prior to 1996, INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 296, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001). Under contemporary law,  if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments,  his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses.6The changes to our immigration law have also involved a change in nomenclature; the statutory text now uses the term “removal” rather than “deportation.” See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U.S. 348, 350, n. 1, 121 S. Ct. 2268, 150 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2001). See 8 U.S.C. § 1229b. Subject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is not available for an offense related to trafficking in a controlled substance. See § 1101(a)(43)(B); § 1228.

These changes to our immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen's criminal conviction. The importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of  crimes has never been more important. These changes confirm our view that,  as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part--indeed, sometimes the most important part7See Brief for Asian American Justice Center et al. as Amici Curiae 12-27 (providing real-world examples). --of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.

II 

 Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is entitled to “the effective  assistance of competent counsel.” McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); Strickland, 466 U.S., at 686, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padilla's ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he sought about the risk of deportation concerned only collateral matters, i.e., those matters not within the sentencing authority of the state trial court.8There is some disagreement among the courts over how to distinguish between direct and collateral consequences. See Roberts, Ignorance Is Effectively Bliss: Collateral Consequences, Silence, and Misinformation in the Guilty-Plea Process, 95 Iowa L. Rev. 119, 124, n. 15 (2009). The disagreement over how to apply the direct/collateral distinction has no bearing on the disposition of this case because, as even Justice Alito agrees, counsel must, at the very least, advise a noncitizen “defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse immigration consequences,” post, at 375, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 299 (opinion concurring in judgment). See also post, at 387, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 307 (“I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinformation”). In his concurring opinion, Justice Alito has thus departed from the strict rule applied by the Supreme Court of Kentucky and in the two federal cases that he cites, post, at 375-376, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 300.253 S. W. 3d,  at 483-484 (citing Commonwealth v. Fuartado, 170 S. W. 3d 384 (2005)). In its view, “collateral consequences are outside the scope of representation required by the Sixth Amendment,” and, therefore, the “failure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of possible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.” 253 S. W. 3d, at 483. The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this view.9 See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 202 F.3d 20 (CA1 2000); United States v. Del Rosario, 902 F.2d 55, 284 U.S. App. D.C. 90 (CADC 1990); United States v. Yearwood, 863 F.2d 6 (CA4 1988); Santos-Sanchez v. United States, 548 F.3d 327 (CA5 2008); Broomes v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 1251 (CA10 2004); United States v. Campbell, 778 F.2d 764 (CA11 1985); Oyekoya v. State, 558 So. 2d 990 (Ala. Crim. App. 1989); State v. Rosas, 183 Ariz. 421, 904 P.2d 1245 (App. 1995); State v. Montalban, 2000-2739 (La. 2/26/02), 810 So. 2d 1106; Commonwealth v. Frometa, 520 Pa. 552, 555 A.2d 92 (1989).

We, however, have never applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally “reasonable professional assistance” required under Strickland, 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Whether that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not consider in this case because of the unique nature of deportation.

We have long recognized that  deportation is a particularly severe “penalty,” Fong Yue Ting v. United States, 149 U.S. 698, 740, 13 S. Ct. 1016, 37 L. Ed. 905 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction. Although removal proceedings are civil in nature, see INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1038, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process. Our law has enmeshed criminal convictions and  the penalty of deportation  for nearly a century, see Part I, supra, at 360-364, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 290-293. And, importantly, recent changes in our immigration law have made removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders. Thus, we find it “most difficult” to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context. United States v. Russell, 686 F.2d 35, 38, 222 U.S. App. D.C. 313 (CADC 1982). Moreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defendants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense find it even more difficult. See St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 322, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (“There can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions”).

 Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is, because of its close connection to the criminal process, uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence. The collateral versus direct distinction is thus ill suited to evaluating a Strickland claim concerning the specific risk of deportation. We conclude that advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Stricklandapplies to Padilla's claim.

III 

 Under Strickland, we first determine whether counsel's representation “fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” 466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Then we ask whether “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The first prong--constitutional deficiency--is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community: “The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.” Id., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. We long have recognized that “[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards and the like . . . are guides to determining what is reasonable . . . .” Ibid.;Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4, 7, 130 S. Ct. 13, 175 L. Ed. 2d 255 (2009)(per curiam); Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 191, and n. 6, 125 S. Ct. 551, 160 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2004); Wiggins v. Smith,539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). Although they are “only guides,” Strickland, 466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, and not “inexorable commands,” Bobby, 558 U.S., at 8, 130 S. Ct. 13, 175 L. Ed. 2d 255, these standards may be valuable measures of the prevailing professional norms of effective representation, especially as these standards have been adapted to deal with the intersection of modern criminal prosecutions and immigration law.

The weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that  counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation. National Legal Aid and Defender Assn., Performance Guidelines for Criminal Defense Representation § 6.2 (1995); G. Herman, Plea Bargaining § 3.03, pp. 20-21 (1997); Chin & Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697, 713-718 (2002); A. Campbell, Law of Sentencing  § 13:23, pp. 555, 560 (3d ed. 2004); Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, 2 Compendium of Standards for Indigent Defense Systems, Standards for Attorney Performance, pp. D10, H8-H9, J8 (2000) (providing survey of guidelines across multiple jurisdictions); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 4-5.1(a), p. 197 (3d ed. 1993); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty 14-3.2(f), p. 116 (3d ed. 1999). “[A]uthorities of every stripe--including the American Bar Association, criminal defense and public defender organizations, authoritative treatises, and state and city bar publications--universally require defense attorneys to advise as to the risk of deportation consequences for non-citizen clients . . . .” Brief for Legal Ethics, Criminal Procedure, and Criminal Law Professors as Amici Curiae 12-14 (footnotes omitted) (citing, inter alia, National Legal Aid and Defender Assn., Performance Guidelines for Criminal Prosecution §§ 6.2-6.4 (1997); S. Bratton & E. Kelley, Practice Points: Representing a Noncitizen  in a Criminal Case, 31 The Champion 61 (Jan./Feb. 2007); N. Tooby, Criminal Defense of Immigrants § 1.3 (3d ed. 2003); 2 Criminal Practice Manual §§ 45:3, 45:15 (West 2009)).

We too have previously recognized that “ '[p]reserving the client's right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence.' " St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 322, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (quoting 3 Criminal Defense Techniques §§ 60A.01, 60A.02[2] (1999)). Likewise, we have recognized that “preserving the possibility of” discretionary relief from deportation under § 212(c) of the 1952 INA, 66 Stat. 187, repealed by Congress in 1996, “would have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.” St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 323, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347. We expected that counsel who were unaware of the discretionary relief measures would “follo[w] the advice of numerous practice guides” to advise themselves of the importance of this particular form of discretionary relief. Ibid., n. 50.

In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence for Padilla's conviction. See 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (“Any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance . . . , other than a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable”). Padilla's counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute, which addresses not some broad classification of crimes but specifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses. Instead, Padilla's counsel provided him false assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal from this country. This is not a hard case in which to find deficiency:  The consequences of Padilla's plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel's advice was incorrect.

Immigration law can be complex,  and it is a legal specialty of its own. Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it. There will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain. The duty of the private practitioner in such cases is more limited.  When the law is not succinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios posited by Justice Alito), a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.10As Justice Alito explains at length, deportation consequences are often unclear. Lack of clarity in the law, however, does not obviate the need for counsel to say something about the possibility of deportation, even though it will affect the scope and nature of counsel's advice. But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.

Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first prong of Strickland. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief on his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy Strickland's second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.

IV 

The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that Strickland applies to Padilla's claim only to the extent that he has alleged affirmative misadvice. In the United States' view, “counsel is not constitutionally required to provide advice on matters that will not be decided in the criminal case . . . ,” though counsel is required to provide accurate advice if she  chooses to discuss these matters. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 10.

Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General's proposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support among the lower courts. See, e.g., United States v. Couto, 311 F.3d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); United States v. Kwan, 407 F.3d 1005 (CA9 2005); Sparks v. Sowders, 852 F.2d 882 (CA6 1988); United States v. Russell, 686 F.2d 35, 222 U.S. App. D.C. 313 (CADC 1982); State v. Rojas-Martinez, 2005 UT 86, 125 P. 3d 930, 935; In re Resendiz, 25 Cal. 4th 230, 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 431, 19 P. 3d 1171 (2001). Kentucky describes these decisions isolating an affirmative misadvice claim as “result-driven, incestuous . . . [, and] completely lacking in legal or rational bases.” Brief for Respondent 31. We do not share that view, but we agree that there is no relevant difference “between an act of commission and an act of omission” in this context. Id., at 30; Strickland, 466 U.S., at 690, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (“The court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance”); see also State v. Paredez, 2004-NMSC-036, 2004 NMSC 36, 136 N. M. 533, 538-539, 101 P.3d 799.

A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite two absurd results. First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available. Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of “the advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.” Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 50-51, 116 S. Ct. 356, 133 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1995). When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all.11As the Commonwealth conceded at oral argument, were a defendant's lawyer to know that a particular offense would result in the client's deportation and that, upon deportation, the client and his family might well be killed due to circumstances in the client's home country, any decent attorney would inform the client of the consequences of his plea. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38. We think the same result should follow when the stakes are not life and death but merely “banishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 390-391, 68 S. Ct. 10, 92 L. Ed. 17 (1947). Second, it would deny a  class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available. It is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation, and the failure to do so “clearly satisfies the first prong of the Strickland analysis.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 62, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).

We have given serious consideration to the concerns that the Solicitor General, respondent, and amici have stressed regarding the importance of protecting the finality of convictions obtained through guilty pleas. We confronted a similar “floodgates” concern in Hill, see id., at 58, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203, but nevertheless appliedStrickland to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.12However, we concluded that, even though Strickland applied to petitioner's claim, he had not sufficiently alleged prejudice to satisfy Strickland's second prong. Hill, 474 U.S., at 59-60, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203. This disposition further underscores the fact that it is often quite difficult for petitioners who have acknowledged their guilt to satisfy Strickland's prejudice prong.Justice Alito believes that the Court misreads Hill, post, at 383-384, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 305. In Hill, the Court recognized--for the first time--that Strickland applies to advice respecting a guilty plea. 474 U.S., at 58, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (“We hold, therefore, that the two-part Strickland v. Washington test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel”). It is true that Hill does not control the question before us. But its import is nevertheless clear. Whether Strickland applies to Padilla's claim follows from Hill, regardless of the fact that the Hill Court did not resolve the particular question respecting misadvice that was before it.

A flood did not follow in that decision's wake. Surmounting Strickland's high bar is never an easy task. See, e.g., 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 ( “Judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential”); id., at 693, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (observing that “[a]ttorney errors . . . are as likely to be utterly harmless in a  particular case as they are to be prejudicial”). Moreover,  to obtain relief on this type of claim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 480, 486, 120 S. Ct. 1029, 145 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2000). There is no reason to doubt that lower courts--now quite experienced with applying Strickland--can effectively and efficiently use its framework to separate specious claims from those with substantial merit.

It seems unlikely that our decision today will have a significant effect on those convictions already obtained as the result of plea bargains. For at  least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client's plea. See supra, at 368-371, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 295-296. We should, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their obligation to render competent advice at the time their clients considered pleading guilty. Strickland, 466 U.S., at 689, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674.

Likewise, although we must be especially careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied Strickland to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage, practice has shown that pleas are less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained after a trial. Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal convictions.13See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics 2003, p. 418 (31st ed. 2005) (Table 5.17) (only approximately 5%, or 8,612 out of 68,533, of federal criminal prosecutions go to trial); id., at 450 (Table 5.46) (only approximately 5% of all state felony criminal prosecutions go to trial). But they account for only approximately 30% of the habeas petitions filed.14See V. Flango, National Center for State Courts, Habeas Corpus in State and Federal Courts 36-38 (1994) (demonstrating that 5% of defendants whose conviction was the result of a trial account for approximately 70% of the habeas petitions filed). The nature of relief secured by a successful collateral  challenge to a guilty plea--an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to trial--imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of the bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a different calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately, the challenge may result in a less favorable outcome for the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a conviction obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside potential.

Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process. By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties. As in this case, a criminal episode may provide the basis for multiple charges, of which only a subset mandate deportation following conviction. Counsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence. At the same time, the threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does not mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a charge that does.

In sum, we have long recognized that  the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Hill, 474 U.S., at 57, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203; see also Richardson, 397 U.S., at 770-771, 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763. The severity of deportation--“the equivalent of  banishment or exile,” Delgadillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 390-391, 68 S. Ct. 10, 92 L. Ed. 17 (1947) --only underscores how critical it is for counsel  to inform her noncitizen client that he faces a risk of deportation.15To this end, we find it significant that the plea form currently used in Kentucky courts provides notice of possible immigration consequences. Ky. Admin. Office of Courts, Motion to Enter Guilty Plea, Form AOC-491 (rev. Feb. 2003), http://courts.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/55E1F54E-ED5C-4A30-B1D5-4C43C7ADD63C/0/491.pdf (as visited Mar. 29, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Further, many States require trial courts to advise defendants of possible immigration consequences. See, e.g., Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(C) (2009-2010); Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 1016.5 (West 2008); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 54-1j (2009); D. C. Code § 16-713 (2001); Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.172(c)(8) (Supp. 2010); Ga. Code Ann. § 17-7-93(c) (1997); Haw. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 802E-2 (2007); Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 2.8(2)(b)(3) (Supp. 2009); Md. Rule 4-242 (Lexis 2009); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 278, § 29D (West 2009); Minn. Rule Crim. Proc. 15.01 (2009); Mont. Code Ann. § 46-12-210 (West 2009); N. M. Rule Crim. Form 9-406 (2009); N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law Ann. § 220.50(7)(West Supp. 2009); N. C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 15A-1022 (Lexis 2007); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2943.031 (West 2006); Ore. Rev. Stat. § 135.385 (2007); R. I. Gen. Laws § 12-12-22 (Lexis Supp. 2008); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 26.13(a)(4) (Vernon Supp. 2009); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, § 6565(c)(1) (Supp. 2009); Wash. Rev. Code § 10.40.200 (2008); Wis. Stat. § 971.08 (2005-2006).

V 

 It is our responsibility under the Constitution to ensure that no criminal defendant--whether a citizen or not--is left to the “mercies of incompetent counsel.” Richardson, 397 U.S., at 771, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763. To satisfy this responsibility, we now hold that counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation. Our longstanding Sixth Amendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as a consequence of a criminal plea, and the concomitant impact of deportation on families living lawfully in this country demand no less.

Taking as true the basis for his motion for postconviction relief, we have little difficulty concluding that Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient. Whether Padilla is entitled to relief will depend on whether he can demonstrate prejudice as a result thereof, a question we do not reach because it was not passed on below.  See Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 530, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2002).

The judgment of the Supreme Court of Kentucky is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari in this case to decide whether imposing class arbitration on parties whose arbitration clauses are “silent” on that issue is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.

I

A 

Petitioners are shipping companies that serve a large share of the world market for parcel tankers--seagoing vessels with compartments that are separately chartered to customers wishing to ship liquids in small quantities. One of those customers is AnimalFeedsInternational Corp. (hereinafter AnimalFeeds), which supplies raw ingredients, such as fish oil, to animal-feed producers around the world. AnimalFeeds ships its goods pursuant to a standard contract known in the maritime trade as a charter party.1“[C]harter parties are commonly drafted using highly standardized forms specific to the particular trades and business needs of the parties.” Comment, A Comparative Analysis of Charter Party Agreements “Subject to” Respective American and British Laws and Decisions . . . It’s All in the Details, 26 Tulane Mar. L. J. 291, 294 (2001-2002); see also 2 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law § 11–1, p. 200 (3d ed. 2001). Numerous charter parties are in regular use, and the charter party that AnimalFeeds uses is known as the “Vegoilvoy” charter party. Petitioners assert, without contradiction, that charterers  like AnimalFeeds, or their agents--not the shipowners--typically select the particular charter party that governs their shipments. Accord, Trowbridge, Admiralty Law Institute: Symposium on Charter Parties: The History, Development, and Characteristics of the Charter Concept, 49 Tulane L. Rev. 743, 753 (1975) (“Voyage charter parties are highly standardized, with many commodities and charterers having their own specialized forms”).

Adopted in 1950, the Vegoilvoy charter party contains the following arbitration clause:

“Arbitration. Any dispute arising from the making, performance or termination of this Charter Party shall be settled in New York, Owner and Charterer each appointing an arbitrator, who shall be a merchant, broker or individual experienced in the shipping business; the two thus chosen, if they cannot agree, shall nominate a third arbitrator who shall be an Admiralty lawyer. Such arbitration shall be conducted in conformity with the provisions and procedure of the United StatesArbitration Act [i.e., the FAA], and a judgment of the Court shall be entered upon any award made by said arbitrator.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 69a.

In 2003, a Department of Justice criminal investigation revealed that petitioners were engaging in an illegal price-fixing conspiracy. When AnimalFeeds learned of this, it brought a putative class action against petitioners in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, asserting antitrust claims for supracompetitive prices that petitioners allegedly charged their customers over a period of several years.

Other charterers brought similar suits. In one of these, the District Court for the District of Connecticut held that the charterers’ claims were not subject to arbitration under the applicable arbitration clause, but the Second Circuit reversed. See JLM Industries, Inc. v. Stolt-Nielsen S. A., 387 F.3d 163, 183 (2004). While that appeal was pending, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered the consolidation of then-pending actions against petitioners, including AnimalFeeds’ action, in the District of Connecticut. See In re Parcel Tanker Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., 296 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1371, and n. 1 (2003). The parties agree that as a consequence of these judgments and orders, AnimalFeeds and petitioners must arbitrate their antitrust dispute.

B 

In 2005, AnimalFeeds served petitioners with a demand for class arbitration, designating New York City as the place of arbitration and seeking to represent a class of “[a]ll direct purchasers of parcel tanker transportation services globally for bulk liquid chemicals, edible oils, acids, and other specialty liquids from [petitioners] at any time during the period from August 1, 1998, to November 30, 2002.” 548 F.3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The parties entered into a supplemental agreement providing for the question of class arbitration to be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators who were to “follow and be bound by Rules 3 through 7 of the American Arbitration Association’s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations (as effective Oct. 8, 2003).” App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a. These rules (hereinafter Class Rules) were developed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) after our decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414 (2003), and Class Rule 3, in accordance with the plurality opinion in that case, requires an arbitrator, as a threshold matter, to determine “whether the applicable arbitration clause permits the arbitration to proceed on behalf of or against a class.” App. 56a.

The parties selected a panel of arbitrators and stipulated that the arbitration clause was “silent” with respect to class arbitration. Counsel for AnimalFeeds explained to the arbitration panel that the term “silent” did not simply mean that  the clause made no express reference to class arbitration. Rather, he said, “[a]ll the parties agree that when a contract is silent on an issue there’s been no agreement that has been reached on that issue.” Id., at 77a.

After hearing argument and evidence, including testimony from petitioners’ experts regarding arbitration customs and usage in the maritime trade, the arbitrators concluded that the arbitration clause allowed for class arbitration. They found persuasive the fact that other arbitrators ruling after Bazzle had construed “a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration,” but the panel acknowledged that none of these decisions was “exactly comparable” to the present dispute. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. Petitioners’ expert evidence did not show an “inten[t] to preclude class arbitration,” the arbitrators reasoned, and petitioners’ argument would leave “no basis for a class action absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class members.” Id., at 51a.

The arbitrators stayed the proceeding to allow the parties to seek judicial review, and petitioners filed an application to vacate the arbitrators’ award in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. See 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4)(authorizing a district court to “make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration . . . where the arbitrators exceeded their powers”); Petition To Vacate Arbitration Award, No. 1:06–CV–00420–JSR (SDNY), App. in No. 06–3474–cv (CA2), p. A–17, 16 (citing § 10(a)(4) as a ground for vacatur of the award); see also id., at A–15 to A–16, 9 (invoking the District Court’s jurisdiction under 9 U.S.C. § 203 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1333). The District Court vacated the award, concluding that the arbitrators’ decision was made in “manifest disregard” of the law insofar as the arbitrators failed to conduct a choice-of-law analysis. 435 F. Supp. 2d 382, 384-385 (SDNY 2006). See Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427, 436-437, 74 S. Ct. 182, 98 L. Ed. 168 (1953) (“[T]he interpretations of the law by the arbitrators  in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation”); see also Petition To Vacate Arbitration Award, supra, at A–17, 17 (alleging that the arbitration panel “manifestly disregarded the law”). Had such an analysis been conducted, the District Court held, the arbitrators would have applied the rule of federal maritime law requiring that contracts be interpreted in light of custom and usage. 435 F. Supp. 2d, at 385-386.

AnimalFeeds appealed to the Court of Appeals, which reversed. See 9 U.S.C. § 16(a)(1)(E) (“An appeal may be taken from . . . an order . . . vacating an award”). As an initial matter, the Court of Appeals held that the “manifest disregard” standard survived our decision in Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008), as a “judicial gloss” on the enumerated grounds for vacatur of arbitration awards under 9 U.S.C. § 10. 548 F.3d, at 94. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals concluded that, because petitioners had cited no authority applying a federal maritime rule of custom and usage against class arbitration, the arbitrators’ decision was not in manifest disregard of federal maritime law. Id., at 97-98. Nor had the arbitrators manifestly disregarded New York law, the Court of Appeals continued, since nothing in New York case law established a rule against class arbitration. Id., at 98-99.

We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 903, 129 S. Ct. 2793, 174 L. Ed. 2d 289 (2009).2Invoking an argument not pressed in or considered by the courts below, the dissent concludes that the question presented is not ripe for our review. See post, at 688, 689-692, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 626, 627-629 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). In so doing, the dissent offers no clear justification for now embracing an argument “we necessarily considered and rejected” in granting certiorari. United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 40, 112 S. Ct. 1735, 118 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1992).  Ripeness reflects constitutional considerations that implicate “Article III limitations on judicial power,” as well as “prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.” Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U.S. 43, 57, n. 18, 113 S. Ct. 2485, 125 L. Ed. 2d 38 (1993). In evaluating a claim to determine whether it is ripe for judicial review, we consider both “the fitness of the issues for judicial decision” and “the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.” National Park Hospitality Assn. v. Department of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 808, 123 S. Ct. 2026, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (2003). To the extent the dissent believes that the question on which we granted certiorari is constitutionally unripe for review, we disagree. The arbitration panel’s award means that petitioners must now submit to class determination proceedings before arbitrators who, if petitioners are correct, have no authority to require class arbitration absent the parties’ agreement to resolve their disputes on that basis. See Class Rule 4(a) (cited in App. 57a); Brief for AAA as Amicus Curiae 17. Should petitioners refuse to proceed with what they maintain is essentially an ultra vires proceeding, they would almost certainly be subject to a petition to compel arbitration under 9 U.S.C. § 4. Cf. Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, 419 U.S. 102, 143, 95 S. Ct. 335, 42 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1974) ( “Where the inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the disputed provisions will come into effect”). We think it is clear on these facts that petitioners have demonstrated sufficient hardship, and that their question is fit for our review at this time. To the extent the dissent believes that the question is prudentially unripe, we reject that argument as waived, Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 56, n. 4, 123 S. Ct. 518, 154 L. Ed. 2d 466 (2002), and we see no reason to disregard the waiver. We express no view as to whether, in a similar case, a federal court may consider a question of prudential ripeness on its own motion. See National Park Hospitality Assn., supra, at 808, 123 S. Ct. 2026, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1017  (“[E]ven in a case raising only prudential concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court’s own motion”).

A 

Petitioners contend that the decision of the arbitration panel must be vacated, but  in order to obtain that relief, they must clear a high hurdle. It is not enough for petitioners to show that the panel committed an error--or even a serious error. See Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 531 U.S. 57, 62, 121 S. Ct. 462, 148 L. Ed. 2d 354 (2000); Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38, 108 S. Ct. 364, 98 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1987). “It is only when [an] arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively ‘dispense[s] his own brand of industrial justice’ that his decision may be unenforceable.” Major League Baseball Players Assn. v. Garvey, 532 U.S. 504, 509, 121 S. Ct. 1724, 149 L. Ed. 2d 740 (2001)(per curiam) (quoting Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car  Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S. Ct. 1358, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1424 (1960)). In that situation, an arbitration decision may be vacated under § 10(a)(4) of the FAA on the ground that the arbitrator “exceeded [his] powers,” for the task of an arbitrator is to interpret and enforce a contract, not to make public policy. In this case, we must conclude that what the arbitration panel did was simply to impose its own view of sound policy regarding class arbitration.3We do not decide whether “ ‘manifest disregard’ ” survives our decision in Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 585, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008), as an independent ground for review or as a judicial gloss on the enumerated grounds for vacatur set forth at 9 U.S.C. § 10. AnimalFeeds characterizes that standard as requiring a showing that the arbitrators “knew of the relevant [legal] principle, appreciated that this principle controlled the outcome of the disputed issue, and nonetheless willfully flouted the governing law by refusing to apply it.” Brief for Respondent 25 (internal quotation marks omitted). Assuming, arguendo, that such a standard applies, we find it satisfied for the reasons that follow.

B

1 

In its memorandum of law filed in the arbitration proceedings, AnimalFeeds made three arguments in support of construing the arbitration clause to permit class arbitration:

“The parties’ arbitration clause should be construed to allow class arbitration because (a) the clause is silent on the issue of class treatment and, without express prohibition, class arbitration is permitted under Bazzle; (b) the clause should be construed to permit class arbitration as a matter of public policy; and (c) the clause would be unconscionable and unenforceable if it forbade class arbitration.” App. in No. 06–3474–cv (CA2), at A–308 to A–309 (emphasis added).

The arbitrators expressly rejected AnimalFeeds’ first argument, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a, and said nothing about the third. Instead, the panel appears to have rested  its decision on AnimalFeeds’ public policy argument.  Because the parties agreed their agreement was “silent” in the sense that they had not reached any agreement on the issue of class arbitration, the arbitrators’ proper task was to identify the rule of law that governs in that situation. Had they engaged in that undertaking, they presumably would have looked either to the FAA itself or to one of the two bodies of law that the parties claimed were governing, i.e., either federal maritime law or New York law. But the panel did not consider whether the FAA provides the rule of decision in such a situation; nor did the panel attempt to determine what rule would govern under either maritime or New York law in the case of a “silent” contract. Instead, the panel based its decision on post-Bazzle arbitral decisions that “construed a wide variety of clauses in a wide variety of settings as allowing for class arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel did not mention whether any of these decisions were based on a rule derived from the FAA or on maritime or New York law.4The panel’s reliance on these arbitral awards confirms that the panel’s decision was not based on a determination regarding the parties’ intent. All of the arbitral awards were made under the AAA’s Class Rules, which were adopted in 2003, and thus none was available when the parties here entered into the Vegoilvoy charter party during the class period ranging from 1998 to 2002. See 548 F.3d 85, 87 (CA2 2008) (defining the class period). Indeed, at the hearing before the panel, counsel for AnimalFeeds conceded that “[w]hen you talk about expectations, virtually every one of the arbitration clauses that were the subject of the 25 AAA decisions were drafted before [Bazzle]. So therefore, if you are going to talk about the parties’ intentions, pre-[Bazzle] class arbitrations were not common, post [Bazzle]they are common.” App. 87a. Moreover, in its award, the panel appeared to acknowledge that none of the cited arbitration awards involved a contract between sophisticated business entities. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a.

Rather than inquiring whether the FAA, maritime law, or New York law contains a “default rule” under which an arbitration clause is construed as allowing class arbitration in the absence of express consent, the panel proceeded as if it  had the authority of a common-law court to develop what it viewed as the best rule to be applied in such a situation. Perceiving a post-Bazzle consensus among arbitrators that class arbitration is beneficial in “a wide variety of settings,” the panel considered only whether there was any good reason not to follow that consensus in this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–50a. The panel was not persuaded by “court cases denying consolidation of arbitrations,”5See Government of United Kingdom v. Boeing Co., 998 F.2d 68, 71, 74 (CA2 1993); see also Glencore, Ltd. v. Schnitzer Steel Prods. Co., 189 F.3d 264, 268 (CA2 1999); Champ v. Siegel Trading Co., 55 F.3d 269, 275 (CA7 1995). Unlike the subsequent arbitration awards that the arbitrators cited, these decisions were available to the parties when they entered into their contracts. by undisputed evidence that the Vegoilvoy charter party had “never been the basis of a class action,” or by expert opinion that “sophisticated, multinational commercial parties of the type that are sought to be included in the class would never intend that the arbitration clauses would permit a class arbitration.”6Petitioners produced expert evidence from experienced maritime arbitrators demonstrating that it is customary in the shipping business for parties to resolve their disputes through bilateral arbitration. See, e.g., App. 126a (expert declaration of John Kimball) (“In the 30 years I have been practicing as a maritime lawyer, I have never encountered an arbitration clause in a charter party that could be construed as allowing class action arbitration”); id., at 139a (expert declaration of Bruce Harris) (“I have been working as a maritime arbitrator for thirty years and this matter is the first I have ever encountered where the issue of a class action arbitration has even been raised”). These experts amplified their written statements in their live testimony, as well. See, e.g., id., at 112a, 113a (Mr. Kimball) (opining that the prospect of a class action in a maritime arbitration would be “quite foreign” to overseas shipping executives and charterers); id., at 111a–112a (Mr. Harris) (opining that in the view of the London Corps of International Arbitration, class arbitration is “inconceivable”).  Under both New York law and general maritime law, evidence of “custom and usage” is relevant to determining the parties’ intent when an express agreement is ambiguous. See Excess Ins. Co. v. Factory Mut. Ins.

Consolidated Edison Co. of N.

See also Great Circle Lines, Ltd. v. Matheson & Co., 681 F.2d 121, 125 (CA2 1982) (“Certain long-standing customs of the shipping industry are crucial factors to be considered when deciding whether there has been a meeting of the minds on a maritime contract”); Samsun Corp. v. Khozestan Mashine Kar Co., 926 F. Supp. 436, 439 (SDNY 1996) (“[W]here as here the contract is one of charter party, established practices and customs of the shipping industry inform the court’s analysis of what the parties agreed to”); Hough, Admiralty Jurisdiction--Of Late Years, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 529, 536 (1924) (noting that “maritime law is a body of sea customs” and the “custom of the sea . . . includes a customary interpretation of contract language”). Id., at 50a–51a. Accordingly, finding no convincing ground for departing from the post-Bazzle arbitral consensus, the panel held that class arbitration was permitted in this case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a. The conclusion is inescapable that the panel simply imposed its own conception of sound policy.7The dissent calls this conclusion “hardly fair,” noting that the word “ ‘policy’ is not so much as mentioned in the arbitrators’ award.” Post, at 694, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 630. But just as merely saying something is so does not make it so, cf. United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 614, 120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000), the arbitrators need not have said they were relying on policy to make it so. At the hearing before the arbitration panel, one of the arbitrators recognized that the body of post-Bazzle arbitration awards on which AnimalFeeds relied involved “essentially consumer non-value cases.” App. 82a. In response, counsel for AnimalFeeds defended the applicability of those awards by asserting that the “vast majority” of the claimants against petitioners “have negative value claims . . . meaning it costs more to litigate than you would get if you won.” Id., at 82a–83a. The panel credited this body of awards in concluding that petitioners had not demonstrated the parties’ intent to preclude class arbitration, and further observed that if petitioners’ anticonsolidation precedents controlled, then “there would appear to be no basis for a class action absent express agreement among all parties and the putative class members.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 50a, 51a.

 2 

It is true that the panel opinion makes a few references to intent, but none of these shows that the panel did anything other than impose its own policy preference. The opinion states that, under Bazzle, “arbitrators must look to the language of the parties’ agreement to ascertain the parties’ intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action,” and the panel added that “[t]his is also consistent with New York law.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a. But the panel had no occasion to “ascertain the parties’ intention” in the present case because the parties were in complete agreement regarding their intent. In the very next sentence after the one quoted above, the panel acknowledged that the parties in this case agreed that the Vegoilvoy charter party was “silent on whether [it] permit[ted] or preclude[d] class arbitration,” but that the charter party was “not ambiguous so as to call for parol evidence.” Ibid. This stipulation left no room for an inquiry regarding the parties’ intent, and any inquiry into that settled question would have been outside the panel’s assigned task.

The panel also commented on the breadth of the language in the Vegoilvoy charter party, see id., at 50a, but since the only task that was left for the panel, in light of the parties’ stipulation, was to identify the governing rule applicable in a case in which neither the language of the contract nor any other evidence established that the parties had reached any agreement on the question of class arbitration, the particular wording of the charter party was quite beside the point.

In sum, instead of identifying and applying a rule of decision derived from the FAA or either maritime or New York  law, the arbitration panel imposed its own policy choice and thus exceeded its powers. As a result,  under § 10(b) of the FAA, we must either “direct a rehearing by the arbitrators” or decide the question that was originally referred to the panel. Because we conclude that there can be only one possible outcome on the facts before us, we see no need to direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.

III

A 

The arbitration panel thought that Bazzle “controlled” the “resolution” of the question whether the Vegoilvoy charter party “permit[s] this arbitration to proceed on behalf of a class,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 48a–49a, but that understanding was incorrect.

Bazzle concerned contracts between a commercial lender (Green Tree) and its customers. These contracts contained an arbitration clause but did not expressly mention class arbitration. Nevertheless, an arbitrator conducted class arbitration proceedings and entered awards for the customers.

The South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the awards. Bazzle v. Green Tree Financial Corp., 351 S. C. 244, 569 S.E.2d 349 (2002). After discussing both Seventh Circuit precedent holding that a court lacks authority to order classwide arbitration under § 4 of the FAA, see Champ v. Siegel Trading Co.,55 F.3d 269 (1995), and conflicting California precedent, see Keating v. Superior Court of Alameda Cty., 31 Cal.3d 584, 183 Cal. Rptr. 360, 645 P.2d 1192 (1982), the State Supreme Court elected to follow the California approach, which it characterized as permitting a trial court to “order class-wide arbitration under adhesive but enforceable franchise contracts,” 351 S.C., at 259, 266, 569 S.E.2d, at 357, 360. Under this approach, the South Carolina court observed, a trial judge must “[b]alanc[e] the potential inequities and inefficiencies”  of requiring each aggrieved party to proceed on an individual basis against “resulting prejudice to the drafting party” and should take into account factors such as “efficiency” and “equity.” Id., at 260, 569 S.E.2d 349, and n. 15, 569 S.E.2d, at 357, and n. 15.

Applying these standards to the case before it, the South Carolina Supreme Court found that the arbitration clause in the Green Tree contracts was “silent regarding class-wide arbitration.” Id., at 263, 569 S.E.2d, at 359 (emphasis deleted). The court described its holding as follows:

“[W]e . . . hold that class-wide arbitration may be ordered when the arbitration agreement is silent if it would serve efficiency and equity, and would not result in prejudice. If we enforced a mandatory, adhesive arbitration clause, but prohibited class actions in arbitration where the agreement is silent, the drafting party could effectively prevent class actions against it without having to say it was doing so in the agreement.” Id., at 266, 569 S.E.2d, at 360 (footnote omitted).

When Bazzle reached this Court, no single rationale commanded a majority. The opinions of the Justices who joined the judgment--that is, the plurality opinion and Justice Stevens’ opinion--collectively addressed three separate questions. The first was which decisionmaker (court or arbitrator) should decide whether the contracts in question were “silent” on the issue of class arbitration. The second was what standard the appropriate decisionmaker should apply in determining whether a contract allows class arbitration. (For example, does the FAA entirely preclude class arbitration? Does the FAA permit class arbitration only under limited circumstances, such as when the contract expressly so provides? Or is this question left entirely to state law?) The final question was whether, under whatever standard is appropriate, class arbitration had been properly ordered in the case at hand.

The plurality opinion decided only the first question, concluding that the arbitrator and not a court should decide whether the contracts were indeed “silent” on the issue of class arbitration. The plurality noted that, “[i]n certain limited circumstances,” involving “gateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy,” it is assumed “that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators,” to make the decision. 539 U.S., at 452, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414. But the plurality opined that the question whether a contract with an arbitration clause forbids class arbitration “does not fall into this narrow exception.” Ibid. The plurality therefore concluded that the decision of the State Supreme Court should be vacated and that the case should be remanded for a decision by the arbitrator on the question whether the contracts were indeed “silent.” The plurality did not decide either the second or the third question noted above.

Justice Stevens concurred in the judgment vacating and remanding because otherwise there would have been “no controlling judgment of the Court,” but he did not endorse the plurality’s rationale. Id., at 455, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part). He did not take a definitive position on the first question, stating only that “[a]rguably the interpretation of the parties’ agreement should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator.” Ibid. (emphasis added). But because he did not believe that Green Tree had raised the question of the appropriate decisionmaker, he preferred not to reach that question and, instead, would have affirmed the decision of the State Supreme Court on the ground that “the decision to conduct a class-action arbitration was correct as a matter of law.” Ibid. Accordingly, his analysis bypassed the first question noted above and rested instead on his resolution of the second and third questions. Thus, Bazzle did not yield a majority decision on any of the three questions.

 B 

Unfortunately, the opinions in Bazzle appear to have baffled the parties in this case at the time of the arbitration proceeding. For one thing, the parties appear to have believed that the judgment in Bazzle requires an arbitrator, not a court, to decide whether a contract permits class arbitration. See App. 89a (transcript of argument before arbitration panel) (counsel for Stolt-Nielsen states: “What [Bazzle] says is that the contract interpretation issue is left up to the arbitrator, that’s the rule in [Bazzle]”). In fact, however, only the plurality decided that question. But we need not revisit that question here because the parties’ supplemental agreement expressly assigned this issue to the arbitration panel, and no party argues that this assignment was impermissible.

Unfortunately, however, both the parties and the arbitration panel seem to have misunderstood Bazzle in another respect, namely, that it established the standard to be applied by a decisionmaker in determining whether a contract may permissibly be interpreted to allow class arbitration. The arbitration panel began its discussion by stating that the parties “differ regarding the rule of interpretation to be gleaned from [the Bazzle] decision.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a (emphasis added). The panel continued:

“Claimants argue that Bazzle requires clear language that forbids class arbitration in order to bar a class action. The Panel, however, agrees with Respondents that the test is a more general one--arbitrators must look to the language of the parties’ agreement to ascertain the parties’ intention whether they intended to permit or to preclude class action.” Ibid.

As we have explained, however,Bazzle did not establish the rule to be applied in deciding whether class arbitration is  permitted.8AnimalFeeds invokes the parties’ supplemental agreement as evidence that petitioners “waived” any claim that the arbitrators could not construe the arbitration agreement to permit class arbitration. Brief for Respondent 15. The dissent concludes, likewise, that the existence of the parties’ supplemental agreement renders petitioners’ argument under § 10(a)(4) “scarcely debatable.” Post, at 694, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 630. These arguments are easily answered by the clear terms of the supplemental agreement itself. The parties expressly provided that their supplemental agreement “does not alter the scope of the Parties’ arbitration agreements in any Charter Party Agreement,” and that “[n]either the fact of this Agreement nor any of its terms may be used to support or oppose any argument in favor of a class action arbitration . . . and may not be relied upon by the Parties, any arbitration panel, any court, or any other tribunal for such purposes.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a–63a (emphasis added).  As with any agreement to arbitrate, we are obliged to enforce the parties’ supplemental agreement “according to its terms.” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 58, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995). The question that the arbitration panel was charged with deciding was whether the arbitration clause in the Vegoilvoy charter party allowed for class arbitration, and nothing in the supplemental agreement conferred authority on the arbitrators to exceed the terms of the charter party itself. Thus, contrary to AnimalFeeds’ argument, these statements show that petitioners did notwaive their argument that Bazzle did not establish the standard for the decisionmaker to apply when construing an arbitration clause. The decision in Bazzle left that question open, and we turn to it now.

IV 

 While the interpretation of an arbitration agreement is generally a matter of state law, see Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle556 U.S. 624, 630-631, 129 S. Ct. 1896, 173 L. Ed. 2d 832 (2009) ); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 493, n. 9, 107 S. Ct. 2520, 96 L. Ed. 2d 426 (1987), the FAA imposes certain rules of fundamental importance, including the basic precept that arbitration “is a matter of consent, not coercion,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1989).

A 

 In 1925, Congress enacted the United StatesArbitration Act, as the FAA was formerly known, for the express purpose  of making “valid and enforceable written provisions or agreements for arbitration of disputes arising out of contracts, maritime transactions, or commerce among the States or Territories or with foreign nations.” 43 Stat. 883. Reenacted and codified in 1947, see 61 Stat. 669,9See generally Sturges & Murphy, Some Confusing Matters Relating to Arbitration Under the United StatesArbitration Act, 17 Law & Contemp. Prob. 580, 580-581, n. 1 (1952) (recounting the history of the United StatesArbitration Act and its 1947 reenactment and codification). the FAA provides, in pertinent part, that a “written provision in any maritime transaction” calling for the arbitration of a controversy arising out of such transaction “shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,” 9 U.S.C. § 2. Under the FAA, a party to an arbitration agreement may petition a United States district court for an order directing that “arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.” § 4. Consistent with these provisions, we have said on numerous occasions that the central or “primary” purpose of the FAA is to ensure that “private agreements to arbitrate are enforced according to their terms.” Volt, supra, at 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488; Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 57, 58, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1995); see also Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 688, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1996). See generally 9 U.S.C. § 4.

 Whether enforcing an agreement to arbitrate or construing an arbitration clause, courts and arbitrators must “give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties.” Volt, supra, at 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488. In this endeavor, “as with any other contract, the parties’ intentions control.” Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985). This is because an arbitrator derives his or her powers from the parties’ agreement to forgo the legal process and submit their disputes to private dispute resolution. See AT&T  Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 648-649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1986) (“[A]rbitrators derive  their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration”); Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (“By agreeing to arbitrate . . . , [a party] trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity, informality, and expedition of arbitration”); see also Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 581, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 (1960) ( an arbitrator “has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties” but rather is “part of a system of self-government created by and confined to the parties” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

 Underscoring the consensual nature of private dispute resolution, we have held that parties are “ ‘generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.’ Mastrobuono, supra, at 57, 115 S. Ct. 1212, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76 ; see also AT&T Technologies, supra, at 648-649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648. For example, we have held that parties may agree to limit the issues they choose to arbitrate, see Mitsubishi Motors, supra, at 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 , and may agree on rules under which any arbitration will proceed, Volt, supra, at 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488. They may choose who will resolve specific disputes. E.g., App. 30a; Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 57, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974); Burchell v. Marsh, 58 U.S. 344, 17 How. 344, 349, 15 L. Ed. 96 (1855); see also International Produce, Inc. v. A/S Rosshavet, 638 F.2d 548, 552 (CA2) (“The most sought-after arbitrators are those who are prominent and experienced members of the specific business community in which the dispute to be arbitrated arose”), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 1017, 101 S. Ct. 3006, 69 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1981).

 We think it is also clear from our precedents and the contractual nature of arbitration that parties may specify with whom they choose to arbitrate their disputes. See EEOC v. Waffle House, Inc., 534 U.S. 279, 289, 122 S. Ct. 754, 151 L. Ed. 2d 755 (2002) (“[N]othing in the [FAA] authorizes a court to compel arbitration of any issues, or by any parties, that are not already covered in the agreement” (emphasis added)); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 20, 103 S. Ct. 927, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983)(“[A]n arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding  the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement”); Steelworkers, supra, at 581, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1409 (an arbitrator ?has no general charter to administer justice for a community which transcends the parties” (internal quotation marks omitted)); accord, First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995) (“[A]rbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve those disputes--but only those disputes--that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration” (emphasis added)). It falls to courts and arbitrators to give effect to these contractual limitations, and when doing so, courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise: to give effect to the intent of the parties. Volt, 489 U.S., at 479, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488.

B 

From these principles, it follows that  a party may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to class arbitration unless there is a contractual basis for concluding that the party agreed to do so. In this case, however, the arbitration panel imposed class arbitration even though the parties concurred that they had reached “no agreement” on that issue, see App. 77a. The critical point, in the view of the arbitration panel, was that petitioners did not “establish that the parties to the charter agreements intended to preclude class arbitration.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. Even though the parties are sophisticated business entities, even though there is no tradition of class arbitration under maritime law, and even though AnimalFeeds does not dispute that it is customary for the shipper to choose the charter party that is used for a particular shipment, the panel regarded the agreement’s silence on the question of class arbitration as dispositive. The panel’s conclusion is fundamentally at war with  the foundational FAA principle that arbitration is a matter of consent.

 In certain contexts, it is appropriate to presume that parties that enter into an arbitration agreement implicitly authorize  the arbitrator to adopt such procedures as are necessary to give effect to the parties’ agreement. Thus, we have said that “ ‘ “procedural” questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition’ are presumptively not for the judge, but for an arbitrator, to decide.” Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002)(quoting John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U.S. 543, 557, 84 S. Ct. 909, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1964)). This recognition is grounded in the background principle that “[w]hen the parties to a bargain sufficiently defined to be a contract have not agreed with respect to a term which is essential to a determination of their rights and duties, a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court.” Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 204 (1979).

An implicit agreement to authorize class-action arbitration, however, is not a term that the arbitrator may infer solely from the fact of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate. This is so because class-action arbitration changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator. In bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural rigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the benefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater efficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators to resolve specialized disputes. See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S. 20, 31, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991); Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U.S., at 628, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444; see also 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyettt, 556 U.S. 247, 247-257, 129 S. Ct. 1456, 173 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009) ) (“Parties generally favor arbitration precisely because of the economics of dispute resolution” (citing Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 123, 121 S. Ct. 1302, 149 L. Ed. 2d 234 (2001)); Gardner-Denver, supra, at 57, 94 S. Ct. 1011, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (“Parties usually choose an arbitrator because they trust his knowledge and judgment concerning the demands and norms of industrial relations”). But the relative benefits of class-action arbitration are much less assured, giving reason to doubt the parties’ mutual consent to resolve  disputes through classwide arbitration. Cf. First Options, supra, at 945, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (noting that “one can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the ‘who should decide arbitrability’ point as giving the arbitrators that power, for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate” contrary to their expectations).

Consider just some of the fundamental changes brought about by the shift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration. An arbitrator chosen according to an agreed-upon procedure, see, e.g., supra, at 667, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 613, no longer resolves a single dispute between the parties to a single agreement, but instead resolves many disputes between hundreds or perhaps even thousands of parties. See App. 86a (“[W]e believe domestic class members could be in the hundreds” and that “[t]here could be class members that ship to and from the U. S. who are not domestic who we think would be covered”); see also, e.g., Bazzle, 351 S.C., at 251, 569 S.E.2d, at 352-353 (involving a class of 1,899 individuals that was awarded damages, fees, and costs of more than $14 million by a single arbitrator). Under the Class Rules, “[t]he presumption of privacy and confidentiality” that applies in many bilateral arbitrations “shall not apply in class arbitrations,” see Addendum to Brief for AAA as Amicus Curiae 10a (Class Rule 9(a)), thus potentially frustrating the parties’ assumptions when they agreed to arbitrate. The arbitrator’s award no longer purports to bind just the parties to a single arbitration agreement, but adjudicates the rights of absent parties as well. Cf. Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 846, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999) (noting that “the burden of justification rests on the exception” to the general rule that “one is not bound by a judgment in personam in a litigation in which he is not designated as a party or to which he has not been made a party by service of process” (internal quotation marks omitted)). And the commercial stakes of class-action arbitration are comparable to those of class-action litigation, cf. App. in No. 06–3474–cv (CA2), at A–77, A–79, 30, 31, 40, even  though the scope of judicial review is much more limited, see Hall Street, 552 U.S., at 588, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254. We think that  the differences between bilateral and class-action arbitration are too great for arbitrators to presume, consistent with their limited powers under the FAA, that the parties’ mere silence on the issue of class-action arbitration constitutes consent to resolve their disputes in class proceedings.10We have no occasion to decide what contractual basis may support a finding that the parties agreed to authorize class-action arbitration. Here, as noted, the parties stipulated that there was “no agreement” on the issue of class-action arbitration. App. 77a.

The dissent minimizes these crucial differences by characterizing the question before the arbitrators as being merely what “procedural mode” was available to present AnimalFeeds’ claims. Post, at 696, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 631. If the question were that simple, there would be no need to consider the parties’ intent with respect to class arbitration. See Howsam, supra, at 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (committing “procedural questions” presumptively to the arbitrator’s discretion (internal quotation marks omitted)). But the FAA requires more. Contrary to the dissent, but consistent with our precedents emphasizing the consensual basis of arbitration, we see the question as being whether the parties agreed toauthorize class arbitration. Here, where the parties stipulated that there was “no agreement” on this question, it follows that the parties cannot be compelled to submit their dispute to class arbitration.

V 

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.


Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice joins and Justice Alito joins in part.

In 1934, private citizens placed a Latin cross on a rock outcropping in a remote section of the Mojave Desert. Their purpose and intent was to honor American soldiers  who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated over time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same place. It is on federal land.

The Court is asked to consider a challenge, not to the first placement of the cross or its continued presence on federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to a private party. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108-87, § 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. The District Court permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We conclude that its judgment was in error.

The Mojave National Preserve (Preserve) spans approximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern California. The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose picturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square miles, exceeding in size the combined area of the Nation's five smallest States. See Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary 755, 1228-1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90 percent of the land in the Preserve is federally owned, with the rest owned either by the State of California or by private parties. The National Park Service, a division of the Department of the Interior, administers the Preserve as part of the National Park System. 16 U.S.C. §§ 410aaa-41 and 410aaa-46.

Sunrise Rock is a granite outcropping located within the Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area in its immediate vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches are located less than two miles away. The record does not indicate whether fencing is used to mark the boundary of these ranches. In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin cross on the rock as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War I. A Latin cross consists of two  bars--a vertical one and a shorter, horizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at various times over the years, most recently in 1998 by Henry Sandoz. Sandoz is a private citizen who owns land elsewhere in the Preserve, a portion of which he is prepared to transfer to the Government in return for its conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross stands, all pursuant to the statute now under review.

The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of 4-inch diameter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less than eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest highway, which lies more than 10 miles away. It is visible, however, from Cima Road, a narrow stretch of blacktop that comes within 100 feet of Sunrise Rock.

The cross has been a gathering place for Easter services since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock and its immediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one time the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating “ 'The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,' and 'Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic] Wars, Death Valley post 2884.' Buono v. Kempthorne, 527 F.3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since disappeared, and the cross now stands unmarked.

Frank Buono, respondent here, is a retired Park Service employee who makes regular visits to the Preserve. Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a religious symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. He alleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendmentand sought an injunction requiring the Government to remove the cross.

The litigation proceeded in what can be described as four stages. In the first, the District Court ruled in Buono's favor on opposing motions for summary judgment. Buono v. Norton, 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD Cal. 2002)(Buono I). As an initial matter, the court found that Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause challenge. Id., at 1210-1214. On the merits, the parties agreed that the dispute should be governed by the so-called Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as follows:

“A government religious practice or symbol will survive an Establishment Clause challenge when it (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that neither advances nor inhibits religion, and (3) does not foster excessive state entanglement with religion.” Buono I, supra, at 1214-1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 91 S. Ct. 2105, 29 L. Ed. 2d 745 (1971)).

The court expressly declined to consider whether the Government's actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214-1215, or whether they caused excessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217, n. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the cross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion, the court granted Buono's request for injunctive relief. The court's order in Buono I (2002 injunction) permanently forbade the Government “from permitting the display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 146a.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it required the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not forbid alternative methods of complying with the order. The Government covered the cross, first with a tarpaulin and later with a plywood box.

On appeal, the judgment of the District Court was affirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono's Establishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543 (CA9 2004)(Buono II). Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the Government's action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had been motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its ruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reasonable observer would perceive a cross on federal land as governmental endorsement of religion. Id., at 549-550. The Government did not seek review by this Court, so that the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Buono II became final.

C 

During the relevant proceedings, Congress enacted certain statutes related to the cross:

(1) Before Buono I was filed, Congress passed an appropriations bill that included a provision forbidding the use of governmental funds to remove the cross. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106-554, § 133, 114 Stat. 2763A-230.

(2) While Buono I was pending before the District Court, Congress designated the cross and its adjoining land “as a national memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.” Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L. 107-117, § 8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The Secretary of the Interior was directed to expend up to $10,000 to acquire a replica of the original cross and its memorial plaque and to install the plaque at a suitable nearby location. § 8137(c).

(3) Three months after Buono I was decided, Congress again prohibited the spending of governmental funds to remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2003, Pub. L. 107-248, § 8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551.

(4) While the Government's appeal in Buono II was pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer statute) directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the VFW the Government's interest in the land that had been designated a  national memorial. Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108-87, § 8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. In exchange, the Government was to receive land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry Sandoz and his wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between the two parcels would be equalized through a cash payment. §§ 8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the property would revert to the Government if not maintained “as a memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.” § 8121(e), 117 Stat. 1100. The statute presents a central issue in this case.

The Court of Appeals in Buono II did not address the effect on the suit of a potential land transfer under the statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as long as two years to complete,” 371 F.3d, at 545, and that its effect was not yet known, id., at 545-546. The court thus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer completed under [the statute] would pass constitutional muster.” Id., at 546.

D 

After the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II, Buono returned to the District Court seeking to prevent the land transfer. He sought injunctive relief against the transfer, either through enforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court described the relevant question as whether the land transfer was a bona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as the Government claimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the cross in place (as Buono claimed). Buono v. Norton, 364 F. Supp. 2d 1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005)(Buono III). In Buono III, the court did not consider whether the transfer itself was an “independent violation of the Establishment Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless concluded that the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the cross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid. The court granted Buono's motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as  moot his motion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182.

The Court of Appeals again affirmed, largely following the reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne, 502 F.3d 1069 (CA9 2007). The Government's motion for rehearing en banc was denied over a dissent by Judge O'Scannlain,527 F.3d 758, and this Court granted certiorari, 555 U.S. 1169, 129 S. Ct. 1313, 173 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2009).

II 

Before considering the District Court's order on the merits, the first inquiry must be with respect to Buono's standing to maintain this action.  To demonstrate standing, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 445, 557 U.S. 433, 129 S. Ct. 2579, 2592, 174 L. Ed. 2d 406, 418 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that Buono's asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not confer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does not find the cross itself objectionable but instead takes offense at the presence of a religious symbol on federal land. Buono does not claim that, as a personal matter, he has been made to feel excluded or coerced, and so, the Government contends, he cannot object to the presence of the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12-17.

Whatever the validity of the objection to Buono's standing, that argument is not available to the Government at this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved the District Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring the removal of the cross, the Government raised the same standing objections it proffers now. Rejecting the Government's position, the District Court entered a judgment in Buono's favor, which the Court of Appeals affirmed in Buono II. The Government did not seek review in this Court. The judgment became final and unreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U.S.C. § 2101(c) for filing a petition  for certiorari. Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co., 261 U.S. 399, 418, 43 S. Ct. 458, 67 L. Ed. 719, 1924 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 486 (1923); see Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 45, 110 S. Ct. 1651, 109 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1990) (90-day deadline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government cannot now contest Buono's standing to obtain the final judgment in Buono I.

Of course, even though the Court may not reconsider whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction, it is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against the land-transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the judgment upon which we granted review.

This was a measure of relief that Buono had standing to seek.  A party that obtains a judgment in its favor acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 763, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1984) (plaintiffs' right to enforce a desegregation decree to which they were parties is “a personal interest, created by law, in having the State refrain from taking specific actions”). Having obtained a final judgment granting relief on his claims, Buono had standing to seek its vindication.

The Government does not deny this proposition as a general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not seeking to vindicate--but rather to extend--the 2002 injunction. The first injunction forbade the Government from maintaining the cross on Sunrise Rock; yet in Buono III he sought to preclude the land transfer, a different governmental action. The Government contends that Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief. Reply Brief for Petitioners 5.

The Government's argument, however, is properly addressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not to Buono's standing to seek that relief. The Government has challenged whether appropriate relief was granted in Buono III in light of the relevant considerations and legal principles, and we shall consider these questions. The standing inquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury that  prompted the plaintiff to invoke the court's jurisdiction in the first place. Buono's entitlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II, he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that injunction. Based on the rights he obtained under the earlier decree--against the same party, regarding the same cross and the same land--his interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing. Although Buono also argued that the land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent” Establishment Clause violation, the District Court did not address or order relief on that claim, which is not before us. Buono III,364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a case in which a party seeks to import a previous standing determination into a wholly different dispute.

In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence contends that the injunction did not provide a basis for the District Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is not an argument about standing but about the merits of the District Court's order. Those points now must be addressed.

III 

The procedural history of this litigation must be considered to identify the issues now subject to review. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction after concluding that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment Clause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that conclusion on appeal, and the judgment became final upon completion of direct review. At that point, the judgment “became res judicata to the parties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey, 557 U.S. 137, 152, 557 U.S. 137, 129 S. Ct. 2195, 2205, 174 L. Ed. 2d 99, 110 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Government  therefore does not--and could not--ask this Court to reconsider the propriety of the 2002 injunction or the District Court's reasons for granting it.

The question now before the Court is whether the District Court properly enjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court did not consider whether the statute, in isolation, would have violated the Establishment Clause, and it did not forbid the land transfer as an independent constitutional violation. Buono III, supra, at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the court enjoined compliance with the statute on the premise that the relief was necessary to protect the rights Buono had secured through the 2002 injunction.

 An injunction is an exercise of a court's equitable authority, to be ordered only after taking into account all of the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective relief. See United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S. Ct. 587, 88 L. Ed. 754 (1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2942, pp. 39-42 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright & Miller). Equitable relief is not granted as a matter of course, see Weinberger, 456 U.S., at 311-312, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91, and a court should be particularly cautious when contemplating relief that implicates public interests, see id., at 312, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (“In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289 U.S. 334, 338, 53 S. Ct. 602, 77 L. Ed. 1208 (1933) (“Where an important public interest would be prejudiced, the reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling”). Because injunctive relief “is drafted in light of what the court believes will be the future course of events, . . . a court must never ignore significant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an injunction lest the decree be turned into an 'instrument of  wrong.' ” Wright & Miller § 2961, at 393-394 (quoting Swift & Co., supra, at 115, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999).

Here, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested relief. The court, however, did not acknowledge the statute's significance. It examined the events that led to the statute's enactment and found an intent to prevent removal of the cross. Deeming this intent illegitimate, the court concluded that nothing of moment had changed. This was error. Even assuming that the land-transfer statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the cross, it does not follow that an injunction against its implementation was appropriate.

By dismissing Congress's motives as illicit, the District Court took insufficient account of the context in which the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage. Private citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to commemorate American servicemen who had died in World War I. Although certainly a Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to promote a Christian message. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.S. 573, 661, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a city to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the roof of city hall . . . because such an obtrusive year-round religious display would place the government's weight behind an obvious effort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion”). Placement of the cross on Government-owned land was not an attempt to set the imprimatur of the state on a particular creed. Rather, those who erected the cross intended simply to honor our Nation's fallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting that the plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with VFW decals”).

 Time also has played its role. The cross had stood on Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it commemorated had become entwined in the public consciousness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay their respects. Rather than let the cross deteriorate, community members repeatedly took it upon themselves to replace it. Congress ultimately designated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it among those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that constitute our national heritage. See note following 16 U.S.C. § 431 (listing officially designated national memorials, including the National D-Day Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial). Research discloses no other national memorial honoring American soldiers--more than 300,000 of them--who were killed or wounded in World War I. See generally A. Leland & M. Oboroceanu, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, American War and Military Operations Casualties: Lists and Statistics 2 (2009). It is reasonable to interpret the congressional designation as giving recognition to the historical meaning that the cross had attained. Cf. Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677, 702-703, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (“40 years” without legal challenge to a Ten Commandments display “suggest that the public visiting the [surrounding] grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage”).

The 2002 injunction thus presented the Government with a dilemma. It could not maintain the cross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the cross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as honoring. Cf. id., at 704, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607 (to invalidate a longstanding Ten Commandments display might “create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid”). Deeming neither alternative to be satisfactory, Congress enacted the statute here at issue. Congress, of course, may not use its legislative powers to reopen final judgments. See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 225-226, 115 S. Ct. 1447, 131 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1995). That principle, however, was not a bar to this statute. The Government's right to transfer the land was not adjudicated in Buono I or compromised by the 2002 injunction.

In belittling the Government's efforts as an attempt to “evade” the injunction, Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, the District Court had things backwards. Congress's prerogative to balance opposing interests and its institutional competence to do so provide one of the principal reasons for deference to its policy determinations. See Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U.S. 496, 513, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982). Here, Congress adopted a policy with respect to land it now owns in order to resolve a specific controversy. Congress, the Executive, and the Judiciary all have a duty to support and defend the Constitution. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 703, 94 S. Ct. 3090, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039 (1974) (“In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others”). The land-transfer statute embodiesCongress's legislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a framework and policy of accommodation for a symbol that, while challenged under the Establishment Clause, has complex meaning beyond the expression of religious views. That judgment should not have been dismissed as an evasion, for the statute brought about a change of law and a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.

Buono maintains that any governmental interest in keeping the cross up must cede to the constitutional concerns on which the 2002 injunction was based. He argues that the land transfer would be “an incomplete remedy” to the constitutional  violation underlying the injunction and that the transfer would make achieving a proper remedy more difficult. Brief for Respondent 54.

 A court must find prospective relief that fits the remedy to the wrong or injury that has been established. See Swift & Co., 286 U.S., at 114, 52 S. Ct. 460, 76 L. Ed. 999 (“A continuing decree of injunction directed to events to come is subject always to adaptation as events may shape the need”). See also United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 249, 88 S. Ct. 1496, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1968). Where legislative action has undermined the basis upon which relief has previously been granted, a court must consider whether the original finding of wrongdoing continues to justify the court's intervention. See Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 648-649, 81 S. Ct. 368, 5 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1961); Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S. 421, 18 How. 421, 430-432, 15 L. Ed. 435 (1856). The relevant question is whether an ongoing exercise of the court's equitable authority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged against the claim that changed circumstances have rendered prospective relief inappropriate.

The District Court granted the 2002 injunction based solely on its conclusion that presence of the cross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of religion. The court expressly disavowed any inquiry into whether the Government's actions had a secular purpose or caused excessive entanglement. Buono I, 212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1215, 1217, n. 9. The Court of Appeals affirmed the injunction on the same grounds, similarly eschewing any scrutiny of governmental purpose. Buono II, 371 F.3d, at 550.

Although, for purposes of the opinion, the propriety of the 2002 injunction may be assumed, the following discussion should not be read to suggest this Court's agreement with that judgment, some aspects of which may be questionable.  The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm. A cross by the side of a public highway marking, for instance,  the place where a state trooper perished need not be taken as a statement of governmental support for sectarian beliefs. The Constitution does not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of religion's role in society. See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1992) (“A relentless and all-pervasive attempt to exclude religion from every aspect of public life could itself become inconsistent with the Constitution”). See also Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 334, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 97 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1987) (“This Court has long recognized that the government may (and sometimes must) accommodate religious practices and that it may do so without violating the Establishment Clause (internal quotation marks omitted)).Rather, it leaves room to accommodate divergent values within a constitutionally permissible framework.

Even assuming the propriety of the original relief, however, the question before the District Court in Buono III was whether to invalidate the land transfer. Given the sole reliance on perception as a basis for the 2002 injunction, one would expect that any relief grounded on that decree would have rested on the same basis. But the District Court enjoined the land transfer on an entirely different basis: its suspicion of an illicit governmental purpose. See Buono III, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182. The court made no inquiry into the effect that knowledge of the transfer of the land to private ownership would have had on any perceived governmental endorsement of religion, the harm to which the 2002 injunction was addressed. The District Court thus used an injunction granted for one reason as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to be objectionable for a different reason. Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper--absent a finding that the relief was necessary to address an independent wrong. See ibid., n. 8 (noting that the court “need not consider [Buono's] other contention that the land transfer itself is an independent violation of the Establishment Clause).

 The District Court should have evaluated Buono's modification request in light of the objectives of the 2002 injunction. The injunction was issued to address the impression conveyed by the cross on federal, not private, land. Even if its purpose were characterized more generally as avoiding the perception of governmental endorsement, that purpose would favor--or at least not oppose--ownership of the cross by a private party rather than by the Government. Cf. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 471, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 1133, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009) (“[P]ersons who observe donated monuments routinely--and reasonably--interpret them as conveying some message on the property owner's behalf”).

Buono argues that the cross would continue to stand on Sunrise Rock, which has no visual differentiation from the rest of the primarily federally owned Preserve. He also points to the reversionary clause in the land-transfer statute requiring that the land be returned to the Government if not maintained as a World War I memorial. Finally, he notes that the cross remains designated a national memorial by an Act of Congress, which arguably would prevent the VFW from dismantling the cross even if it wanted to do so. Brief for Respondent 37-48.

The District Court failed to consider whether, in light of the change in law and circumstances effected by the land-transfer statute, the “reasonable observer” standard continued to be the appropriate framework through which to consider the Establishment Clause concerns invoked to justify the requested relief.  As a general matter, courts considering Establishment Clause challenges do not inquire into “reasonable observer” perceptions with respect to objects on private land. Even if, however, this standard were the appropriate one, but see County of Allegheny, 492 U.S., at 668, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 106 L. Ed. 2d 472 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (criticizing the “reasonable observer” test); Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 763-768, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (1995) (plurality opinion) (criticizing reliance on “perceived endorsement”), it is not clear that Buono's claim is meritorious.  That test requires the hypothetical construct of an objective observer who knows all of the pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding the symbol and its placement. See id., at 780, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But see id., at 767-768, 115 S. Ct. 2440, 132 L. Ed. 2d 650 (plurality opinion) (doubting the workability of the reasonable observer test). Applying this test here, the message conveyed by the cross would be assessed in the context of all relevant factors. See Van Orden, 545 U.S., at 700, 125 S. Ct. 2854, 162 L. Ed. 2d 607(Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (the Establishment Clause inquiry “must take account of context and consequences”); Lee, supra, at 597, 112 S. Ct. 2649, 120 L. Ed. 2d 467 (“Our Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains a delicate and fact-sensitive one”).

The District Court did not attempt to reassess the findings in Buono I in light of the policy of accommodation that Congress had embraced. Rather, the District Court concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the cross, divorced from its background and context. But a Latin cross is not merely a reaffirmation of Christian beliefs. It is a symbol often used to honor and respect those whose heroic acts, noble contributions, and patient striving help secure an honored place in history for this Nation and its people. Here, one Latin cross in the desert evokes far more than religion. It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the fallen are forgotten.

 Respect for a coordinate branch of Government forbids striking down an Act of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607, 120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000); El Paso & Northeastern R. Co. v. Gutierrez, 215 U.S. 87, 96, 30 S. Ct. 21, 54 L. Ed. 106 (1909). The same respect requires that a congressional command be given effect unless no legal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional  judgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient accommodation in light of the earlier finding of religious endorsement, it was incumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief than complete invalidation of the land-transfer statute. See Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U.S. 320, 329, 126 S. Ct. 961, 163 L. Ed. 2d 812 (2006) (in granting relief, “we try not to nullify more of a legislature's work than is necessary, for we know that [a] ruling of unconstitutionality frustrates the intent of the elected representatives of the people” (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)); Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684, 107 S. Ct. 1476, 94 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1987). For instance, if there is to be a conveyance, the question might arise regarding the necessity of further action, such as signs to indicate the VFW's ownership of the land. As we have noted, Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to install near the cross a replica of its original memorial plaque. One of the signs that appears in early photographs of the cross specifically identifies the VFW as the group that erected it.

Noting the possibility of specific remedies, however, is not an indication of agreement about the continued necessity for injunctive relief. The land-transfer statute's bearing on this dispute must first be determined. To date, this Court's jurisprudence in this area has refrained from making sweeping pronouncements, and this case is ill suited for announcing categorical rules. In light of the finding of unconstitutionality in Buono I, and the highly fact-specific nature of the inquiry, it is best left to the District Court to undertake the analysis in the first instance. On remand, if Buono continues to challenge implementation of the statute, the District Court should conduct a proper inquiry as described above.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.


Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case requires us to review the grant of a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). The District Court in this case issued the writ to respondent Reginald Lett on the ground that his Michigan murder conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Constitution, and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. In doing so, however, these courts misapplied AEDPA’s deferential standard of review. Because we conclude that the Michigan Supreme Court’s application of federal law was not unreasonable, we reverse.

I 

On August 29, 1996, an argument broke out in a Detroit liquor store. The antagonists included Adesoji Latona, a taxi driver; Charles Jones, a passenger who claimed he had been wrongfully ejected from Latona’s cab; and Reginald Lett, a friend of Jones’s. After the argument began, Lett left the liquor store, retrieved a handgun from another friend outside in the parking lot, and returned to the store. He shot Latona twice, once in the head and once in the chest. Latona died from his wounds shortly thereafter. See People v. Lett, 466 Mich. 206, 208-209, 644 N.W.2d 743, 745 (2002).

Michigan prosecutors charged Lett with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a  felony. His trial took place in June 1997. From jury selection to jury instructions the trial took less than nine hours, spread over six different days. Id., at 209, 644 N.W.2d, at 745.

The jury’s deliberations began on June 12, 1997, at 3:24 p.m., and ran that day until 4 p.m. Id., at 209, n. 1, 644 N.W.2d, at 745, n. 1. After resuming its work the next morning, the jury sent the trial court a note--one of seven it sent out in its two days of deliberations--stating that the jurors had “ ‘a concern about our voice levels disturbing any other proceedings that might be going on.’ ” Id., at 209, n. 2, 644 N.W.2d, at 745, n. 2. Later, the jury sent out another note, asking “ ‘What if we can’t agree? [M]istrial? [R]etrial? [W]hat?’ ” Id., at 209, 644 N.W.2d, at 745.

The trial transcript does not reveal whether the judge discussed the jury’s query with counsel, off the record, upon receiving this last communication. Id., at 209, n. 3, 644 N.W.2d, at 745, n. 3. What is clear is that at 12:45 p.m. the judge called the jury back into the courtroom, along with the prosecutor and defense counsel. Once the jury was seated, the following exchange took place:

“THE COURT: I received your note asking me what if you can’t agree? And I have to conclude from that that that is your situation at this time. So, I’d like to ask the foreperson to identify themselves, please?

“THE FOREPERSON: [Identified herself.]

“THE COURT: Okay, thank you. All right. I need to ask you if the jury is deadlocked; in other words, is there a disagreement as to the verdict?

“THE FOREPERSON: Yes, there is.

“THE COURT: All right. Do you believe that it is hopelessly deadlocked?

“THE FOREPERSON: The majority of us don’t believe that--

“THE COURT: (Interposing) Don’t say what you’re going to say, okay?

 “THE FOREPERSON: Oh, I’m sorry.

“THE COURT: I don’t want to know what your verdict might be, or how the split is, or any of that. Thank you. Okay? Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?

“THE FOREPERSON: (No response)

“THE COURT: Yes or no?

“THE FOREPERSON: No, Judge.” Tr. in No. 96–08252 (Recorder’s Court, Detroit, Mich.), pp. 319–320.

The judge then declared a mistrial, dismissed the jury, and scheduled a new trial for later that year. Neither the prosecutor nor Lett’s attorney made any objection.

Lett’s second trial was held before a different judge and jury in November 1997. This time, the jury was able to reach a unanimous verdict--that Lett was guilty of second-degree murder--after deliberating for only 3 hours and 15 minutes. Lett, supra, at 210, and n. 4, 644 N.W.2d, at 746, and n. 4.

Lett appealed his conviction to the Michigan Court of Appeals. He argued that the judge in his first trial had announced a mistrial without any manifest necessity for doing so. Because the mistrial was an error, Lett maintained, the State was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Constitution from trying him a second time. The Michigan Court of Appeals agreed with Lett and reversed his conviction.

The State appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court, which reversed the Court of Appeals. The court explained that under our decision in United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. 579, 9 Wheat. 579, 6 L. Ed. 165 (1824), a defendant may be retried following the discharge of a deadlocked jury, even if the discharge occurs without the defendant’s consent. Lett, 466 Mich., at 216-217, 644 N.W.2d, at 749. There is no Double Jeopardy Clause violation in such circumstances, it noted, so long as the trial court exercised its “ ‘sound discretion’ ” in concluding that the jury was deadlocked and thus that there was a “ ‘manifest necessity’ ”  for a mistrial. Ibid. (quoting Perez, supra, at 580, 22 U.S. 579, 6 L. Ed. 165; emphasis deleted). The court further observed that, under our decision in Arizona v.  Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 506-510, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1978), an appellate court must generally defer to a trial judge’s determination that a deadlock has been reached. 466 Mich., at 218-222, 644 N.W.2d, at 750-752.

After setting forth the applicable law, the Michigan Supreme Court determined that the judge at Lett’s first trial had not abused her discretion in declaring the mistrial. Id., at 223, 644 N.W.2d, at 753. The court cited the facts that the jury “had deliberated for at least four hours following a relatively short, and far from complex, trial,” that the jury had sent out several notes, “including one that appears to indicate that its discussions may have been particularly heated,” and--“[m]ost important”--“that the jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.” Ibid.

Lett petitioned for a federal writ of habeas corpus. Again he argued that the trial court’s declaration of a mistrial constituted an abuse of discretion because there was no manifest necessity to cut short the jury’s deliberations. He further contended that the Michigan Supreme Court’s rejection of his double jeopardy claim amounted to “an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,” and thus that he was not barred by AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), from obtaining federal habeas relief. The District Court agreed and granted the writ. 507 F. Supp. 2d 777 (ED Mich. 2007). On appeal, a divided panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. 316 Fed. Appx. 421 (2009). The State petitioned for review in our Court, and we granted certiorari. 558 U.S. 1047, 130 S. Ct. 743, 175 L. Ed. 2d 513 (2009).

II 

It is important at the outset to define the question before us. That question is not whether the trial judge should have declared a mistrial. It is not even whether it was an  abuse of discretion for her to have done so--the applicable standard on direct review.  The question under AEDPA is instead whether the determination of the Michigan Supreme Court that there was no abuse of discretion was “an unreasonable application of . . . clearly established Federal law.” § 2254(d)(1).

We have explained that “an unreasonable application of federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.” Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 410, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). Indeed, “a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.” Id., at 411, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. Rather, that application must be “objectively unreasonable.? Id., at 409, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. This distinction creates “a substantially higher threshold” for obtaining relief than de novo review. Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007). AEDPA thus imposes a “highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,” Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 333, n. 7, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1997), and “demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S. Ct. 357, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279 (2002) (per curiam).1The dissent correctly points out that AEDPA itself “never uses the term ‘deference.’ ” Post, at 797, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 702 (opinion of Stevens, J.). But our cases have done so over and over again to describe the effect of the threshold restrictions in 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) on granting federal habeas relief to state prisoners. See, e.g., Wellons v. Hall, 558 U.S. 220, 223-224, n. 3, 130 S. Ct. 727, 175 L. Ed. 2d 684 (2010) (per curiam); Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.S. 139, 142-143, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L. Ed. 2d 595 (2010); McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120, 132-133, 130 S. Ct. 665, 175 L. Ed. 2d 582 (2010) (per curiam); Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 463, 472, 129 S. Ct. 1769, 173 L. Ed. 2d 701 (2009); Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 112, n. 2, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2009); Waddington v. Sarausad, 555 U.S. 179, 194, 129 S. Ct. 823, 172 L. Ed. 2d 532 (2009).

The “clearly established Federal law” in this area is largely undisputed. In Perez, we held that  when a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury cannot reach a verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a new trial for the defendant before a new jury. 9 Wheat., at 579-580, 22 U.S. 579, 6 L. Ed. 165. We explained that trial judges may declare a mistrial “whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into  consideration, there is a manifest necessity” for doing so. Id., at 580, 22 U.S. 579, 6 L. Ed. 165. The decision to declare a mistrial is left to the “sound discretion” of the judge, but “the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.” Ibid.

Since Perez, we have clarified that  the “manifest necessity” standard “cannot be interpreted literally,” and that a mistrial is appropriate when there is a “ ‘high degree’ ” of necessity. Washington, supra, at 506, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. The decision whether to grant a mistrial is reserved to the “broad discretion” of the trial judge, a point that “has been consistently reiterated in decisions of this Court.” Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1973). See also Gori v. United States, 367 U.S. 364, 368, 81 S. Ct. 1523, 6 L. Ed. 2d 901 (1961).

In particular,  “[t]he trial judge’s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is . . . accorded great deference by a reviewing court.” Washington, 434 U.S., at 510, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. A “mistrial premised upon the trial judge’s belief that the jury is unable to reach a verdict [has been] long considered the classic basis for a proper mistrial.” Id., at 509, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717; see also Downum v. United States, 372 U.S. 734, 736, 83 S. Ct. 1033, 10 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1963) (deadlocked jury is the “classic example” of when the State may try the same defendant twice).

 The reasons for “allowing the trial judge to exercise broad discretion” are “especially compelling” in cases involving a potentially deadlocked jury. Washington, 434 U.S., at 509, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. There, the justification for deference is that “the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.” Id., at 510, n. 28, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. In the absence of such deference, trial judges might otherwise “employ coercive means to break the apparent deadlock,” thereby creating a “significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors.” Id., at 510, 509, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717.

 This is not to say that we grant absolute deference to trial judges in this context. Perez itself noted that the judge’s exercise of discretion must be “sound,” 9 Wheat., at 580, 22 U.S. 579, 6 L. Ed. 165, and we have made clear that “[i]f the record reveals that the trial judge has failed to exercise the ‘sound discretion’ entrusted to him, the reason for such deference by an appellate court disappears,” Washington, 434 U.S., at 510, n. 28, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. Thus “if the trial judge acts for reasons completely unrelated to the trial problem which purports to be the basis for the mistrial ruling, close appellate scrutiny is appropriate.” Ibid. Similarly, “if a trial judge acts irrationally or irresponsibly, . . . his action cannot be condoned.” Id., at 514, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717 (citing United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 91 S. Ct. 547, 27 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1971), and Somerville, supra, at 469, 462, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425).

 We have expressly declined to require the “mechanical application” of any “rigid formula” when trial judges decide whether jury deadlock warrants a mistrial. Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 691, 690, 69 S. Ct. 834, 93 L. Ed. 974 (1949). We have also explicitly held that a trial judge declaring a mistrial is not required to make explicit findings of “ ‘manifest necessity’ ” nor to “articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.” Washington, supra, at 517, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. And we have never required a trial judge, before declaring a mistrial based on jury deadlock, to force the jury to deliberate for a minimum period of time, to question the jurors individually, to consult with (or obtain the consent of) either the prosecutor or defense counsel, to issue a supplemental jury instruction, or to consider any other means of breaking the impasse. In 1981, then-Justice Rehnquist noted that this Court had never “overturned a trial court’s declaration of a mistrial after a jury was unable to reach a verdict on the ground that the ‘manifest necessity’ standard had not been met.” Winston v. Moore, 452 U.S. 944, 947, 101 S. Ct. 3092, 69 L. Ed. 2d 960 (opinion dissenting from denial of certiorari). The same remains true today, nearly 30 years later.

The legal standard applied by the Michigan Supreme Court in this case was whether there was an abuse of the “broad discretion” reserved to the trial judge. Somerville, supra, at 462, 462, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425; Washington, supra, at 509, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717. This type of general standard triggers another consideration under AEDPA.  When assessing whether a state court’s application of federal law is unreasonable, “the range of reasonable judgment can depend in part on the nature of the relevant rule” that the state court must apply. Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004). Because AEDPA authorizes federal courts to grant relief only when state courts act unreasonably, it follows that “[t]he more general the rule” at issue--and thus the greater the potential for reasoned disagreement among fair-minded judges--“the more leeway [state] courts have in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations.” Ibid.; see also Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U.S. 111, 123, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2009).

III 

In light of all the foregoing, the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision in this case was not unreasonable under AEDPA, and the decision of the Court of Appeals to grant Lett a writ of habeas corpus must be reversed.

The Michigan Supreme Court’s adjudication involved a straightforward application of our longstanding precedents to the facts of Lett’s case. The court cited our own double jeopardy cases--from Perez to Washington--elaborating upon the “manifest necessity” standard for granting a mistrial and noting the broad deference that appellate courts must give trial judges in deciding whether that standard has been met in any given case. Lett, 466 Mich., at 216-222, 644 N.W.2d, at 749-752. It then applied those precedents to the particular facts before it and found no abuse of discretion, especially in light of the length of deliberations after a short and uncomplicated trial, the jury notes suggesting heated discussions and asking what would happen “if we can’t agree,” and--“[m]ost important”--“the fact that the  jury foreperson expressly stated that the jury was not going to reach a verdict.” Id., at 223, 644 N.W.2d, at 753. In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court to determine that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial.

The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded otherwise. It did not contest the Michigan Supreme Court’s description of the objective facts, but disagreed with the inferences to be drawn from them. For example, it speculated that the trial judge may have misinterpreted the jury’s notes as signs of discord and deadlock when, read literally, they expressly stated no such thing. 316 Fed. Appx., at 427. It further determined that the judge’s brief colloquy with the foreperson may have wrongly implied a false equivalence between “mere disagreement” and “genuine deadlock,” and may have given rise to “inappropriate pressure” on her to say that the jury would be unable to reach a verdict. Id., at 426-427. The trial judge’s mistakes were so egregious, in the Court of Appeals’ view, that the Michigan Supreme Court’s opinion finding no abuse of discretion was not only wrong but objectively unreasonable. Id., at 427.

The Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the trial record is not implausible. Nor, for that matter, is the more inventive (surely not “crude”) speculation of the dissent. Post, at 789, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 697. After all, the jury only deliberated for four hours, its notes were arguably ambiguous, the trial judge’s initial question to the foreperson was imprecise, and the judge neither asked for elaboration of the foreperson’s answers nor took any other measures to confirm the foreperson’s prediction that a unanimous verdict would not be reached.2We do not think it reasonable, however, to contend that “the foreperson had no solid basis for estimating the likelihood of deadlock.” Post, at 790, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 698. She had, after all, participated in the jury’s deliberations.

But other reasonable interpretations of the record are also possible. Lett’s trial was not complex, and there is no reason that the jury would necessarily have needed more than  a few hours to deliberate over his guilt. The notes the jury sent to the judge certainly could be read as reflecting substantial disagreement, even if they did not say so outright. Most important, the foreperson expressly told the judge--in response to her unambiguous question “Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict, or not?”--that the jury would be unable to agree. Lett, supra, at 210, 644 N.W.2d, at 745.

Given the foregoing facts, the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision upholding the trial judge’s exercise of discretion--while not necessarily correct--was not objectively unreasonable.3It is not necessary for us to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision--or, for that matter, the trial judge’s declaration of a mistrial--was right or wrong. The latter question, in particular, is a close one. As Lett points out, at a hearing before the Michigan Court of Appeals, the state prosecutor expressed the view that the judge had in fact erred in dismissing the jury and declaring a mistrial. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to accept this confession of error, People v. Lett, 463 Mich. 939, 620 N.W.2d 855 (2000), and in any event--for the reasons we have explained--whether the trial judge was right or wrong is not the pertinent question under AEDPA. Not only are there a number of plausible ways to interpret the record of Lett’s trial, but the standard applied by the Michigan Supreme Court--whether the judge exercised sound discretion--is a general one, to which there is no “plainly correct or incorrect” answer in this case. Yarborough, supra, at 664, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938; see also Knowles, supra, at 123, 129 S. Ct. 1411, 173 L. Ed. 2d 251. The Court of Appeals’ ruling in Lett’s favor failed to grant the Michigan courts the dual layers of deference required by AEDPA and our double jeopardy precedents.

The Court of Appeals also erred in a second respect. It relied upon its own decision in Fulton v. Moore, 520 F.3d 522 (CA6 2008), for the proposition “that Arizona v. Washington sets forth three factors that determine whether a judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial: whether the judge (1) heard the opinions of the parties’ counsel about the propriety of the mistrial; (2) considered the alternatives to a mistrial; and (3) acted deliberately, instead  of abruptly.” 316 Fed. Appx., at 426. It then cited Fulton’s interpretation of Washington to buttress its conclusion that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in concluding that the trial judge had exercised sound discretion. 316 Fed. Appx., at 428.

The Fulton decision, however, does not constitute “clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court,” § 2254(d)(1), so any failure to apply that decision cannot independently authorize habeas relief under AEDPA. Nor, as the dissent suggests, can Fulton be understood merely to “illuminat[e]” Washington. Post, at 796, 176 L. Ed. 2d, at 701. Washington nowhere established these three factors as a constitutional test that “determine[s]” whether a trial judge has exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial. 316 Fed. Appx., at 426.

In concluding that Lett is not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, we do not deny that the trial judge could have been more thorough before declaring a mistrial. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, id., at 427-428, she could have asked the foreperson additional followup questions, granted additional time for further deliberations, or consulted with the prosecutor and defense counsel before acting. Any of these steps would have been appropriate under the circumstances. None, however, was required--either under our double jeopardy precedents or, by extension, under AEDPA.

* * * 

 AEDPA prevents defendants--and federal courts--from using federal habeas corpus review as a vehicle to second-guess the reasonable decisions of state courts. Whether or not the Michigan Supreme Court’s opinion reinstating Lett’s conviction in this case was correct, it was clearly not unreasonable. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns the remedy for missing a statutory deadline. The statute in question focuses upon mandatory restitution for victims of crimes. It provides that  “the court  shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.” 18 U.S.C. § 3664(d)(5). We hold that  a sentencing court that misses the 90-day deadline nonetheless retains the power to order restitution--at least where, as here, the sentencing court made clear prior to the deadline's expiration that it would order restitution, leaving open (for more than 90 days) only the amount.

I 

On February 8, 2007, petitioner Brian Dolan pleaded guilty to a federal charge of assault resulting in serious bodily injury. 18 U.S.C. §§ 113(a)(6), 1153; App. 17. He entered into a plea agreement that stated that “restitution . . . may be ordered by the Court.” Id., at 18. The presentence report, provided to the court by the end of May, noted that restitution was required. But, lacking precise information about hospital costs and lost wages, it did not recommend a restitution amount. Id., at 27.

On July 30, the District Court held Dolan's sentencing hearing. The judge sentenced Dolan to 21 months' imprisonment along with 3 years of supervised release. Id., at 38. The judge, aware that restitution was “mandatory,” said that there was “insufficient information on the record at this time regarding possible restitution payments that may be owed,” that he would “leave that matter open, pending the receipt of additional information,” and that Dolan could “anticipate that such an award will be made in the future.” Id., at 39-40. A few days later (August 8) the court entered a judgment, which, among other things, stated:

“Pursuant to the Mandatory Restitution Act, restitution is applicable; however, no information has been received regarding possible restitution payments that may be owed. Therefore, the Court will not order restitution at this time.” Id., at 49 (boldface deleted).

 The probation office later prepared an addendum to the presentence report, dated October 5, which reflected the views of the parties, and which the judge later indicated he had received. Id., at 54. The addendum documents the “total amount of restitution” due in the case (about $105,000). Id., at 52. Its date, October 5, is 67 days after Dolan's July 30 sentencing and 23 days before the statute's “90 days after sentencing” deadline would expire. § 3664(d)(5).

The sentencing court nonetheless set a restitution hearing for February 4, 2008--about three months after the 90-day deadline expired. As far as the record shows, no one asked the court for an earlier hearing. At the hearing, Dolan pointed out that the 90-day deadline had passed. Id., at 54-55. And he argued that the law no longer authorized the court to order restitution. Id., at 60-64.

The court disagreed and ordered restitution. See Memorandum Opinion and Restitution Order in No. CR 06-02173-RB (D NM, Apr. 24, 2008), App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 571 F.3d 1022 (CA10 2009). And, in light of differences among the Courts of Appeals, we granted Dolan's petition for certiorari on the question. Compare United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35 (CA1 2004) (recognizing court's authority to enter restitution order past 90 days) and United States v.  Balentine, 569 F.3d 801 (CA8 2009) (same), with United States v. Maung, 267 F.3d 1113 (CA11 2001) (finding no such authority), and United States v. Farr, 419 F.3d 621 (CA7 2005) (same).

A 

There is no doubt in this case that the court missed the 90-day statutory deadline “for the final determination of the victim's losses.” § 3664(d)(5). No one has offered any excuse for the court's doing so. Nor did any party seek an extension or “tolling” of the 90 days for equitable or for other reasons. All the information needed to determine the  requisite restitution amount was available before the 90-day period had ended. Thus, the question before us concerns the consequences of the missed deadline where, as here, the statute does not specify them.

In answering this kind of question,  this Court has looked to statutory language, to the relevant context, and to what they reveal about the purposes that a time limit is designed to serve. The Court's answers have varied depending upon the particular statute and time limit at issue. Sometimes we have found that the statute in question imposes a “jurisdictional” condition upon, for example, a court's authority to hear a case, to consider pleadings, or to act upon motions that a party seeks to file. See, e.g.,Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007). But cf. Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.S. 443, 455, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2004) (finding bankruptcy rule did not show legislative intent to “delineat[e] the classes of cases” and “persons” properly “within a court's adjudicatory authority”); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 160-161, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18, 26-28 (2010) (discussing use of term “jurisdictional”). The expiration of a “jurisdictional” deadline prevents the court from permitting or taking the action to which the statute attached the deadline. The prohibition is absolute. The parties cannot waive it, nor can a court extend that deadline for equitable reasons. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 133-134, 128 S. Ct. 750, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008).

In other instances, we have found that certain deadlines are more ordinary “claims-processing rules,” rules that do not limit a court's jurisdiction, but rather regulate the timing of motions or claims brought before the court. Unless a party points out to the court that another litigant has missed such a deadline, the party forfeits the deadline's protection. See, e.g.,Kontrick v. Ryan, supra, at 454-456, 124 S. Ct. 906, 157 L. Ed. 2d 867 (60-day bankruptcy rule deadline for creditor's objection to debtor discharge); Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. Ed. 2d 14 (2005)(per curiam) (7-day criminal rule deadline for filing motion for a new trial).

In still other instances, we have found that a deadline seeks speed by creating a time-related directive that is legally enforceable but does not deprive a judge or other public official of the power to take the action to which the deadline applies if the deadline is missed. See, e.g.,United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 722, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1990)(missed deadline for holding bail detention hearing does not require judge to release defendant); Brock v. Pierce County, 476 U.S. 253, 266, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1986) (missed deadline for making final determination as to misuse of federal grant funds does not prevent later recovery of funds); Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.S. 149, 171-172, 123 S. Ct. 748, 154 L. Ed. 2d 653 (2003) (missed deadline for assigning industry retiree benefits does not prevent later award of benefits).

After examining the language, the context, and the purposes of the statute, we conclude that the provision before us sets forth this third kind of limitation.  The fact that a sentencing court misses the statute's 90-day deadline, even through its own fault or that of the Government, does not deprive the court of the power to order restitution.

B 

Several considerations lead us to this conclusion. First,  where, as here, a statute “does not specify a consequence for noncompliance with” its “timing provisions,” “federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction.” United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.S. 43, 63, 114 S. Ct. 492, 126 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1993); see also Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 717-721, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720. Cf., e.g., Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1); § 3162(a)(2) (statute specifying that missed 70-day deadline requires dismissal of indictment); Zedner v. United States, 547 U.S. 489, 507-509, 126 S. Ct. 1976, 164 L. Ed. 2d 749 (2006) (“The sanction for a violation of the Act is dismissal”).

We concede that the statute here uses the word “shall,” § 3664(d)(5), but  a statute's use of that word alone has not always led this Court to interpret statutes to bar judges (or other officials) from taking the action to which a missed statutory  deadline refers. See, e.g.,Montalvo-Murillo, supra, at 718-719, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720 (use of word “shall” in context of bail hearing makes duty “mandatory” but does not mean that the “sanction for breach” is “loss of all later powers to act”); Brock, supra, at 262, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248 (same in context of misuse of federal funds); Barnhart, supra, at 158-163, 123 S. Ct. 748, 154 L. Ed. 2d 653 (same in context of benefits assignments). See also Regions Hospital v. Shalala, 522 U.S. 448, 459, n. 3, 118 S. Ct. 909, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1998) (same in respect to federal official's reporting date).

Second,the statute's text places primary weight upon, and emphasizes the importance of, imposing restitution upon those convicted of certain federal crimes. Amending an older provision that left restitution to the sentencing judge's discretion, the statute before us (entitled “The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996”) says “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.” § 3663A(a)(1) (emphasis added); cf. § 3663(a)(1) (stating that a court “may” order restitution when sentencing defendants convicted of other specified crimes). The Act goes on to provide that restitution shall be ordered in the “full amount of each victim's losses” and “without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.” § 3664(f)(1)(A).

Third,  the Act's procedural provisions reinforce this substantive purpose, namely, that the statute seeks primarily to assure that victims of a crime receive full restitution. To be sure speed is important. The statute requires a sentencing judge to order the probation office to prepare a report providing “a complete accounting of the losses to each victim, any restitution owed pursuant to a plea agreement, and information relating to the economic circumstances of each defendant.” § 3664(a). The prosecutor, after consulting with all identified victims, must “promptly provide” a listing of the amount subject to restitution “not later than 60 days  prior to the date initially set for sentencing.” § 3664(d)(1) (emphasis added). And the provision before us says:

“If the victim's losses are not ascertainable by the date that is 10 days prior to sentencing, the attorney for the Government or the probation officer shall so inform the court, and the court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses, not to exceed 90 days after sentencing.” § 3664(d)(5).

But  the statute seeks speed primarily to help the victims of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant. Thus, in the sentence following the language we have just quoted, the statute continues:

“If the victim subsequently discovers further losses, the victim shall have 60 days after discovery of those losses in which to petition the court for an amended restitution order.” Ibid.

The sentence imposes no time limit on the victim's subsequent discovery of losses. Consequently, a court might award restitution for those losses long after the original sentence was imposed and the 90-day time limit has expired. That fact, along with the Act's main substantive objectives, is why we say that the Act's efforts to secure speedy determination of restitution is primarily designed to help victims of crime secure prompt restitution rather than to provide defendants with certainty as to the amount of their liability. Cf. S. Rep. No. 104- 179, p. 20 (1995) (recognizing “the need for finality and certainty in the sentencing process,” but also stating that the “sole due process interest of the defendant being protected . . . is the right not to be sentenced on the basis of invalid premises or inaccurate information”); see also ibid. (“[J]ustice cannot be considered served until full restitution is made”).

Fourth, to read the statute as depriving the sentencing court of the power to order restitution would harm those--the victims of crime--who likely bear no responsibility for  the deadline's being missed and whom the statute also seeks to benefit. Cf. § 3664(g)(1) (“No victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order”).  The potential for such harm--to third parties--normally provides a strong indication that Congress did not intend a missed deadline to work a forfeiture, here depriving a court of the power to award restitution to victims. See Brock, 476 U.S., at 262, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248 (parties concede and court assumes that official can “proceed after the deadline” where “inaction” would hurt third party); see also 3 N. Singer & J. Singer, Sutherland on Statutory Construction § 57:19, pp. 73-74 (7th ed. 2008) (hereinafter Singer, Statutory Construction) (missing a deadline does not remove power to exercise a duty where there is no “language denying performance after a specified time,” and especially “where a mandatory construction might do great injury to persons not at fault, as in a case where slight delay on the part of a public officer might prejudice private rights or the public interest” (footnote omitted)).

Fifth, we have previously interpreted similar statutes similarly. In Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720, for example, we considered the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which states that a “judicial officer shall hold a hearing” to determine whether to grant bail to an arrested person and that “hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer.” (A continuance of up to five days may also be granted.) 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f) (emphasis added). The judicial officer missed this deadline, but the Court held that the judicial officer need not release the detained person. Rather, “once the Government discovers that the time limits have expired, it may [still] ask for a prompt detention hearing and make its case to detain based upon the requirements set forth in the statute.” 495 U.S., at 721, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720.

The Court reasoned that “a failure to comply” with the hearing deadline “does not so subvert the procedural scheme . . . as to invalidate the hearing.” Id., at 717, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720. Missing the deadline did not diminish the strength of the Government's  interest in preventing release to avert the likely commission of crimes--the very objective of the Act. Id., at 720, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720. Nor would mandatory release of the detained person “proportion[ately]” repair the “inconvenience and uncertainty a timely hearing would have spared him.” Id., at 721, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720.

Here, as inMontalvo-Murillo,  neither the language nor the structure of the statute requires denying the victim restitution in order to remedy a missed hearing deadline. As in Montalvo-Murillo, doing so would defeat the basic purpose of the Mandatory  Victims Restitution Act. And, here, as in Montalvo-Murillo, that remedy does not “proportion[ately]” repair the harm caused the defendant through delay, particularly where, as here, the defendant “knew about restitution,” including the likely amount, well before expiration of the 90-day time limit. App. 62. Indeed, our result here follows from Montalvo-Murilloa fortiori, for here delay at worst postpones the day of financial reckoning. In Montalvo-Murillo, delay postponed a constitutionally guaranteed bail hearing with the attached risk that the defendant would remain improperly confined in jail. See 495 U.S., at 728, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting the seriousness “of the deprivation of liberty that physical detention imposes”).

Nor does Montalvo-Murillo stand alone. The Court there found support in similar cases involving executive officials charged with carrying out mandatory public duties in a timely manner. See id., at 718, 110 S. Ct. 2072, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720 (citing French v. Edwards, 80 U.S. 506, 13 Wall. 506, 511, 20 L. Ed. 702 (1872); Brock, supra, at 260, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248). Those cases, in turn, are consistent with numerous similar decisions made by courts throughout the Nation. See, e.g.,Taylor v. Department of Transp., 260 N.W.2d 521, 522-523 (Iowa 1977); Hutchinson v. Ryan, 154 Kan. 751, 756-757, 121 P.2d 179, 182 (1942); State v. Industrial Comm'n, 233 Wis. 461, 466, 289 N. W. 769, 771 (1940); see also 3 Singer, Statutory Construction § 57:19, at 74 (citing cases).

Sixth,the defendant normally can mitigate any harm that a missed deadline might cause--at least if, as here, he obtains  the relevant information regarding the restitution amount before the 90-day deadline expires. A defendant who fears the deadline will be (or just has been) missed can simply tell the court, which will then likely set a timely hearing or take other statutorily required action. See § 3664(d)(4) (providing that “court may require additional documentation or hear testimony”); § 3664(d)(5). Though a deliberate failure of the sentencing court to comply with the statute seems improbable, should that occur, the defendant can also seek mandamus. See All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a); La Buy v. Howes Leather Co., 352 U.S. 249, 77 S. Ct. 309, 1 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1957). Cf. Brock, 476 U.S., at 260, n. 7, 106 S. Ct. 1834, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248 (noting availability of district court action to compel agency compliance with time-related directive).

C 

Petitioner Dolan, however, believes we have understated the harm to a defendant that a missed deadline can cause. To show this he makes a three-part argument: (1) A defendant cannot appeal a sentence unless it is part of a “final judgment”; (2) a judgment setting forth a sentence is not “final” until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution; and (3) to delay the determination of the amount of restitution beyond the 90-day deadline is to delay the defendant's ability to appeal for more than 90 days--perhaps to the point where his due process rights are threatened. Brief for Petitioner 28-33.

The critical problem with this argument lies in its third step. As we have said, a defendant who, like petitioner here, knows that restitution will be ordered and is aware of the restitution amount prior to the expiration of the 90-day deadline can usually avoid additional delay simply by pointing to the statute and asking the court to grant a timely hearing. That did not happen here. And that minimal burden on the defendant is a small cost relative to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims of their due restitution.  (Should the court still refuse, the defendant could seek mandamus--which we believe will rarely be necessary.)

Even in the unlikely instances where that delay does cause the defendant prejudice--perhaps by depriving him of evidence to rebut the claimed restitution amount--the defendant remains free to ask the court to take that fact into account upon review. That inquiry might also consider the reason for the delay and the party responsible for its cause, i.e., whether the Government or the victim. Cf., e.g.,United States v. Stevens, 211 F.3d 1, 4-6 (CA2 2000) (tolling 90-day deadline for defendant's bad-faith delay); United States v. Terlingo, 327 F.3d 216, 218-223 (CA3 2003) (same). Adopting the dissent's approach, by contrast, would permit a defendant's bad-faith delay to prevent a timely order of restitution, potentially allowing the defendant to manipulate whether restitution could be awarded at all. But since we are not presented with such a case here, we need not decide whether, or how, such potential harm or equitable considerations should be taken into consideration.

In focusing upon the argument's third step, we do not mean to imply that we accept the second premise, i.e., that a sentencing judgment is not “final” until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution. To the contrary, strong arguments favor the appealability of the initial judgment irrespective of the delay in determining the restitution amount. The initial judgment here imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release, and stated that restitution would be awarded. This Court has previously said that a judgment that imposes “discipline” may still be “freighted with sufficiently substantial indicia of finality to support an appeal.” Corey v. United States, 375 U.S. 169, 174, 175, 84 S. Ct. 298, 11 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Solicitor General points to statutes that say that a “judgment of conviction” that “includes” a “sentence to imprisonment” is a “final judgment.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(b). So is a judgment that imposes supervised release (which can  be imposed only in conjunction with a sentence of imprisonment). Ibid.;§ 3583(a). So is a judgment that imposes a fine. § 3572(c). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.

Moreover, § 3664(o) provides that a “sentence that imposes an order of restitution,” such as the later restitution order here, “is a final judgment.” Thus, it is not surprising to find instances where a defendant has appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment; that same defendant has subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution; and the Court of Appeals has consolidated the two appeals and decided them together. See, e.g., United States v. Stevens, supra; United  States v. Maung, 267 F.3d 1113, 1117 (CA11 2001); cf. United States v. Cheal, 389 F.3d 35, 51-53 (CA1 2004).

That the defendant can appeal from the earlier sentencing judgment makes sense, for otherwise the statutory 90-day restitution deadline, even when complied with, could delay appeals for up to 90 days. Defendants, that is, would be forced to wait three months before seeking review of their conviction when they could ordinarily do so within 14 days. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b). Nonetheless, in light of the fact that the interaction of restitution orders with appellate time limits could have consequences extending well beyond cases like the present case (where there was no appeal from the initial conviction and sentence), we simply note the strength of the arguments militating against the second step of petitioner's argument without deciding whether or when a party can, or must, appeal. We leave all such matters for another day.

The dissent, however, creates a rule that could adversely affect not just restitution, but other sentencing practices beyond the narrow circumstances presented here. Consider, for example, a judge who (currently lacking sufficient information) wishes to leave open, say, the amount of a fine, or a special condition of supervised release. In the dissent's view, the entry of any such judgment would immediately deprive  the judge of the authority later to fill in that blank, in the absence of a statute specifically providing otherwise. See post, at 622-624, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 124-126 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). Thus, the sentencing judge would either have to (1) forgo the specific dollar amount or potential condition, or (2) wait to enter any judgment until all of the relevant information is at hand. The former alternative would sometimes deprive judges of the power to enter components of a sentence they may consider essential. The latter alternative would require the defendant to wait--perhaps months--before taking an appeal.

As we have pointed out, our precedents do not currently place the sentencing judge in any such dilemma. See supra, at 611-612, 614-615, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 117, 119-120. And we need not now depart from those precedents when this case does not require us to do so; when the issue has not been adequately briefed; when the lower court had no opportunity to consider the argument (which the petitioner may well have forfeited); and when the rule would foreclose the current practices of some district courts and unnecessarily cabin the discretion they properly exercise over scheduling and sentencing matters. Cf., e.g.,United States v. Stevens, 211 F.3d, at 3; United States v. Cheal, supra, at 47 (illustrating district court practices).

Certainly there is no need to create this rule in the context of restitution, for provisions to which the dissent refers are silent about whether restitution can or cannot be ordered after an initial sentencing. See, e.g., §§ 3551(b), (c) (“A sanction authorized by [criminal forfeiture and restitution statutes] may be imposed in addition to the [rest of the] sentence”); § 3663A(c)(1) (mandatory orders of restitution “shall apply in all sentencing proceedings [for specified offenses]”). And even on the dissent's theory, the statute elsewhere provides the necessary substantive authorization:  “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a defendant convicted of [a specified] offense . . . , the court shall order . . . that the defendant make restitution to the victim  of the offense.” § 3663A(a)(1)(emphasis added). The dissent cannot explain why a separate statutory provision regarding procedures as to when a “court shall set a date for the final determination of the victim's losses,” § 3664(d)(5), automatically divests a court of this distinct substantive authority. While of course that provision does not “plainly” confer “power to act after sentencing,” post, at 625, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 126 (emphasis deleted), neither does it “plainly” remove it or require that all sentencing matters be concluded at one point in time. (And the dissent's assertion, see post, at 626, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 126--that it uses the term “authority” not in its “jurisdictional” sense, but rather in the sense that a court lacks “authority” to “impose a sentence above the maximum”--introduces a tenuous analogy that may well confuse this Court's precedents regarding the term “jurisdictional.” See supra, at 610-611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 116-117.)

In any event, unless one reads the relevant statute's 90-day deadline as an ironclad limit upon the judge's authority to make a final determination of the victim's losses, the statute before us itself provides adequate authority to do what the sentencing judge did here--essentially fill in an amount-related blank in a judgment that made clear that restitution was “applicable.” App. 49 (boldface deleted). Since the sentencing judge's later order did not “correct” an “error” in the sentence, Rule 35 does not apply. Compare Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 35(a) with post, at 622-623, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 124-125. Hence the dissent's claim that there is no other statute that creates authority (even were we to assume all else in its favor, which we do not) is merely to restate the question posed in this case, not to answer it.

Moreover, the dissent's reading creates a serious statutory anomaly. It reads the statute as permitting a sentencing judge to order restitution for a “victim” who “subsequently discovers further losses” a month, a year, or 10 years after entry of the original judgment, while at the same time depriving that judge of the power to award restitution to a victim whose “losses are not ascertainable” within 90 days.  Compare § 3664(d)(5) (first sentence) with § 3664(d)(5) (second sentence). How is that a sensible reading of a statute that makes restitution mandatory for victims?

Finally, petitioner asks us to apply the “rule of lenity” in favor of his reading of the statute. Dolan has not provided us with an example of an instance in which the “rule of lenity” has been applied to a statutory time provision in the criminal context. See United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. 76, 5 Wheat. 76, 5 L. Ed. 37 (1820) (applying rule in interpreting substantive criminal statute); Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 400, 100 S. Ct. 2247, 65 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1980) (applying rule in interpreting “penalties”). But, assuming for argument's sake that the rule might be so applied, and after considering the statute's text, structure, and purpose, we nonetheless cannot find a statutory ambiguity sufficiently “grievous” to warrant its application in this case. Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 139, 118 S. Ct. 1911, 141 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). See Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 316, 118 S. Ct. 2007, 141 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1998) (rejecting application of rule where the “ambiguous” reading “is an implausible reading of the congressional purpose”).

For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is affirmed.


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from using employment practices that cause a disparate impact on the basis of race (among other bases). 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). It also requires plaintiffs, before beginning a federal lawsuit, to file a timely charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). § 2000e-5(e)(1). We consider whether a plaintiff who does not file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a practice--here, an employer's decision to exclude employment applicants who did not achieve a certain score on an examination--may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the employer's later application of that practice.

I 

In July 1995, the city of Chicago (City) administered a written examination to over 26,000 applicants seeking to serve in the Chicago Fire Department. After scoring the examinations, the City reported the results. It announced in a January 26, 1996, press release that it would begin drawing randomly from the top tier of scorers, i.e., those who scored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well qualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to the next phase--a physical-abilities test, background check, medical examination, and drug test--and if they cleared those hurdles would be hired as candidate firefighters. Those who scored below 65, on the other hand, learned by letters sent the same day that they had failed the test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing score, would no longer be considered for a firefighter position, and would not be contacted again about the examination.

The applicants in-between--those who scored between 65 and 88, whom the City called “qualified”1Certain paramedics who scored between 65 and 88 were deemed “well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining agreement, and certain veterans in the “qualified” range had five points added to their scores and therefore became “well qualified.” --were notified that  they had passed the examination but that, based on the City's projected hiring needs and the number of “well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be called for further processing. The individual notices added, however, that because it was not possible to predict how many applicants would be hired in the next few years, each “qualified” applicant's name would be kept on the eligibility list maintained by the department of personnel for as long as that list was used. Eleven days later, the City officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the breakdown described above.

On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first class of applicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a second on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine more times over the next six years. As it had announced, in each round the City drew randomly from among those who scored in the “well-qualified” range on the 1995 test. In the last round it exhausted that pool, so it filled the remaining slots with “qualified” candidates instead.

On March 31, 1997, Crawford M. Smith, an African-American applicant who scored in the “qualified” range and had not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. Five others followed suit, and on July 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all six of them right-to-sue letters. Two months later, they filed this civil action against the City, alleging (as relevant here) that its practice of selecting for advancement only applicants who scored 89 or above caused a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII. The District Court certified a class--petitioners here--consisting of the more than 6,000 African-Americans who scored in the “qualified” range on the 1995 examination but had not been hired.2In addition to the class members, the African American Fire Fighters League of Chicago, Inc., also joined the suit as a plaintiff.

 The City sought summary judgment on the ground that petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300 days after their claims accrued. See § 2000e-5(e)(1). The District Court denied the motion, concluding that the City's “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results constituted a “continuing violation” of Title VII. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. The City stipulated that the 89-point cutoff had a “severe disparate impact against African Americans,” Final Pretrial Order, Record, Doc. 223, Schedule A, p. 2, but argued that its cutoff score was justified by business necessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court ruled for petitioners, rejecting the City's business-necessity defense. It ordered the City to hire 132 randomly selected members of the class (reflecting the number of African-Americans the court found would have been hired but for the City's practices) and awarded backpay to be divided among the remaining class members.

The Seventh Circuit reversed. 528 F.3d 488 (2008). It held that petitioners' suit was untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the only discriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well-qualified,” “qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The hiring decisions down the line were immaterial, it reasoned, because “[t]he hiring only of applicants classified 'well qualified' was the automatic consequence of the test scores rather than the product of a fresh act of discrimination.” Id., at 491. We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 47, 174 L. Ed. 2d 631 (2009).

II

A 

 Before beginning a Title VII suit, a plaintiff must first file a timely EEOC charge. In this case, petitioners' charges were due within 300 days “after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.” § 2000e-5(e)(1).3All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to petitioners' charges pursuant to 29 CFR §§ 1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1), 1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Products Co., 486 U.S. 107, 112, 114-122, 108 S. Ct. 1666, 100 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1988). Determining  whether a plaintiff's charge is timely thus requires “identify[ing] precisely the 'unlawful employment practice' of which he complains.” Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1980). Petitioners here challenge the City's practice of picking only those who had scored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later chose applicants to advance. Setting aside the first round of selection in May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cutoff, no one disputes that the conduct petitioners challenge occurred within the charging period.4Because the District Court certified petitioners as a class, and because a court may award class wide relief even to unnamed class members who have not filed EEOC charges, see Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. 747, 771, 96 S. Ct. 1251, 47 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1976), petitioners assert and the City does not dispute that the date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a named plaintiff--that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997--controls the timeliness of the class's claims. We assume without deciding that this is correct. The real question, then, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct is timely, but whether the practice thus defined can be the basis for a disparate-impact claim at all.

We conclude that it can. As originally enacted, Title VII did not expressly prohibit employment practices that cause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an “unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,” § 2000e-2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of” any of the same reasons, § 2000e-2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1971), we interpreted the latter provision to “proscrib[e] not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation.”

 Two decades later, Congress codified the requirements of the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had recognized. Pub. L. 102-166, § 105, 105 Stat. 1071, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k). That provision states:

 “(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established under this subchapter only if--“(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity . . . .”

Thus,  a plaintiff establishes a prima facie disparate-impact claim by showing that the employer “uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact” on one of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis added). See Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S. 557, 578, 129 S. Ct. 2658, 174 L. Ed. 2d 490, 506 (2009).

Petitioners' claim satisfies that requirement. Title VII does not define “employment practice,” but we think it clear that the term encompasses the conduct of which petitioners complain: the exclusion of passing applicants who scored below 89 (until the supply of scores 89 or above was exhausted) when selecting those who would advance. The City “use[d]” that practice in each round of selection. Although the City had adopted the eligibility list (embodying the score cutoffs) earlier and announced its intention to draw from that list, it made use of the practice of excluding those who scored 88 or below each time it filled a new class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this exclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they adequately proved that is not before us. What matters is that their allegations, based on the City's actual implementation of its policy, stated a cognizable claim.

 The City argues that subsection (k) is inapposite because it does not address “accrual” of disparate-impact claims. Section 2000e-5(e)(1), it says, specifies when the time to file a charge starts running. That is true but irrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May 1996 (which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging period), the acts petitioners challenge--the City's use of its cutoff score in selecting candidates--occurred within the charging period. Accordingly, no one disputes that if petitioners could bring new claims based on those acts, their claims were timely. The issue, in other words, is not when petitioners' claims accrued, but whether they could accrue at all.

The City responds that subsection (k) does not answer that question either; that it speaks, as its title indicates, only to the plaintiff's “[b]urden of proof in disparate impact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact claims, which the City says are be found in § 2000e-2(a)(2). That is incorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the burden of proof--not just who bears it, however, but also what it consists of. It does set forth the essential ingredients of a disparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is established” if an employer “uses” an “employment practice” that “causes a disparate impact” on one of the enumerated bases. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). That it also sets forth a business-necessity defense employers may raise, ibid, and explains how plaintiffs may prevail despite that defense, § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is irrelevant. Unless and until the defendant pleads and proves a business-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins simply by showing the stated elements.

B 

Notwithstanding the text of § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i) and petitioners' description of the practice they claim was unlawful, the City argues that the unlawful employment practice here was something else entirely. The only actionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when it “used the exami nation results to create the hiring eligibility list, limited hiring to the 'well qualified' classification, and notified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23. That initial decision, it concedes, was unlawful. But because no timely charge challenged the decision, that cannot now be the basis for liability. And because, the City claims, the exclusion of petitioners when selecting classes of firefighters followed inevitably from the earlier decision to adopt the cutoff score, no new violations could have occurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the same analysis. See 528 F.3d, at 490-491.

The City's premise is sound, but its conclusion does not follow. It may be true that the City's January 1996 decision to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a list of the applicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding disparate-impact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 445-451, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 73 L. Ed. 2d 130 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no timely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “entitled to treat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1977). But it does not follow that no new violation occurred--and no new claims could arise--when the City implemented that decision down the road. If petitioners could prove that the City “use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate impact,” they could prevail.

The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528 F.3d, at 490-491, insists that Evans and a line of cases following it require a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982 (2007); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc., 490 U.S. 900, 109 S. Ct. 2261, 104 L. Ed. 2d 961 (1989); Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431. Those cases, we are told, stand for the proposition that present effects of prior actions cannot lead to Title VII liability.

We disagree. As relevant here, those cases establish only that  a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present violation” within the limitations period. Evans, supra, at 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571 (emphasis deleted). What that requires depends on the claim asserted. For disparate-treatment claims--and others for which discriminatory intent is required--that means the  plaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the limitations period. See Ledbetter, supra, at 624-629, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982; Lorance, supra, at 904-905, 109 S. Ct. 2261, 104 L. Ed. 2d 961; Ricks, supra, at 256-258, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431; Evans, supra, at 557-560, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571; see also Chardon v. Fernandez, 454 U.S. 6, 8, 102 S. Ct. 28, 70 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1981)(per curiam). But for claims that do not require discriminatory intent, no such demonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter, supra, at 640, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982; Lorance, supra, at 904, 908-909, 109 S. Ct. 2261, 104 L. Ed. 2d 961. Our opinions, it is true, described the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in those cases complained as “present effect[s]” of past discrimination. Ledbetter, supra, at 628, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 167 L. Ed. 2d 982; see also Lorance, supra, at 907, 109 S. Ct. 2261, 104 L. Ed. 2d 961; Chardon, supra, at 8, 102 S. Ct. 28, 70 L. Ed. 2d 6; Ricks, supra, at 258, 101 S. Ct. 498, 66 L. Ed. 2d 431; Evans, supra, at 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 52 L. Ed. 2d 571. But the reason they could not be the present effects of present discrimination was that the charged discrimination required proof of discriminatory intent, which had not even been alleged. That reasoning has no application when, as here,  the charge is disparate impact, which does not require discriminatory intent.

The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion, reasoning that the difference between disparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim at the same evil--discrimination on a prohibited basis--but simply seek to establish it by different means. 528 F.3d, at 491-492. Disparate-impact liability, the Court of Appeals explained, “ 'is primarily intended to lighten the plaintiff's heavy burden of proving intentional discrimination after employers learned to cover their tracks.' Id., at 492 (quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 967 F.2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if the two theories were directed at the same evil, it would not follow that their reach is therefore coextensive.  If the effect of applying Title VII's text is that some claims that would be doomed under one theory will survive under the other, that is the product of the law Congress has written. It is not for us to rewrite the statute so that it covers only what we think is necessary to achieve what we think Congress really intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79-80, 118 S. Ct. 998, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201 (1998).

The City also argues that, even if petitioners could have proved a present disparate-impact violation, they never did so under the proper test. The parties litigated the merits--and the City stipulated that the cutoff score caused disparate impact--after the District Court adopted petitioners' “continuing violation” theory. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. That theory, which petitioners have since abandoned, treated the adoption and application of the cutoff score as a single, ongoing wrong. As a result, the City says, “petitioners never proved, or even attempted to prove, that use of the [eligibility] list had disparate impact,” Brief for Respondent 32 (emphasis added), since the theory they advanced did not require them to do so. If the Court of Appeals determines that the argument has been preserved it may be available on remand. But it has no bearing here. The only question presented to us is whether the claim petitioners brought is cognizable. Because we conclude that it is, our inquiry is at an end.

C 

The City and its amici warn that our reading will result in a host of practical problems for employers and employees alike. Employers may face new disparate-impact suits for practices they have used regularly for years. Evidence essential to their business-necessity defenses might be unavailable (or in the case of witnesses' memories, unreliable) by the time the later suits are brought. And affected employees and prospective employees may not even know they have claims if they are unaware the employer is still applying the disputed practice.

Truth to tell, however, both readings of the statute produce puzzling results. Under the City's reading, if an employer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely charge is brought, it can continue using the practice indefinitely, with impunity, despite ongoing disparate impact. Equitable tolling  or estoppel may allow some affected employees or applicants to sue, but many others will be left out in the cold. Moreover, the City's reading may induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file charges upon the announcement of a hiring practice, before they have any basis for believing it will produce a disparate impact.

In all events, it is not our task to assess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law Congress enacted.  By enacting § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i), Congress allowed claims to be brought against an employer who uses a practice that causes disparate impact, whatever the employer's motives and whether or not he has employed the same practice in the past. If that effect was unintended, it is a problem for Congress, not one that federal courts can fix.

III 

The City asserts that one aspect of the District Court's judgment still must be changed. The first round of hiring firefighters occurred outside the charging period even for the earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, applying the continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based on those acts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not oppose the City's request for a remand to resolve this issue. We therefore leave it to the Seventh Circuit to determine, to the extent that point was properly preserved, whether the judgment must be modified in light of our decision.

* * * 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.

 “Every contract, combination in the form of a trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade” is made illegal by § 1 of the Sherman Act, ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 1. The question whether an arrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is different from and antecedent to the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade. This case raises that antecedent question about the business of the 32 teams in the National Football League (NFL) and a corporate entity that they formed to manage their intellectual property. We conclude that the NFL's licensing activities constitute concerted action that is not categorically beyond the coverage of § 1. The legality of that concerted action must be judged under the Rule of Reason.

 I 

Originally organized in 1920, the NFL is an unincorporated association that now includes 32 separately owned professional football teams.1 The NFL was founded in Canton, Ohio, as the “American Professional Football Association.” United States Football League v. National Football League, 842 F.2d 1335, 1343 (CA2 1988). It took its current name in 1922. Ibid. Forty-one franchises failed in the first 41 years of the league's existence. Ibid. Each team has its own name, colors, and logo, and owns related intellectual property. Like each of the other teams in the league, the New Orleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts, for example, have their own distinctive names, colors, and marks that are well known to millions of sports fans.

Prior to 1963, the teams made their own arrangements for licensing their intellectual property and marketing trademarked items such as caps and jerseys. In 1963, the teams formed National Football League Properties (NFLP) to develop, license, and market their intellectual property. Most, but not all, of the substantial revenues generated by NFLP have either been given to charity or shared equally among the teams. However, the teams are able to and have at times sought to withdraw from this arrangement.

Between 1963 and 2000, NFLP granted nonexclusive licenses to a number of vendors, permitting them to manufacture and sell apparel  bearing team insignias. Petitioner, American Needle, Inc., was one of those licensees. In December 2000, the teams voted to authorize NFLP to grant exclusive licenses, and NFLP granted Reebok International Ltd. an exclusive 10-year license to manufacture and sell trademarked headwear for all 32 teams. It thereafter declined to renew American Needle's nonexclusive license.

American Needle filed this action in the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that the agreements between the NFL, its teams, NFLP, and Reebok violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. In their answer to the complaint, the defendants averred  that the teams, NFL, and NFLP were incapable of conspiring within the meaning of § 1 “because they are a single economic enterprise, at least with respect to the conduct challenged.” App. 99. After limited discovery, the District Court granted summary judgment on the question “whether, with regard to the facet of their operations respecting exploitation of intellectual property rights, the NFL and its 32 teams are, in the jargon of antitrust law, acting as a single entity.” American Needle, Inc. v. New Orleans La. Saints, 496 F. Supp. 2d 941, 943 (2007). The court concluded “that in that facet of their operations they have so integrated their operations that they should be deemed a single entity rather than joint ventures cooperating for a common purpose.” Ibid.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The panel observed that “in some contexts, a league seems more aptly described as a single entity immune from antitrust scrutiny, while in others a league appears to be a joint venture between independently owned teams that is subject to review under § 1.” 538 F.3d 736, 741 (2008). Relying on Circuit precedent, the court limited its inquiry to the particular conduct at issue, licensing of teams' intellectual property. The panel agreed with petitioner that “when making a single-entity determination, courts must examine whether the conduct in question deprives the marketplace of the independent sources of economic control that competition assumes.” Id., at 742. The court, however, discounted the significance of potential competition among the teams regarding the use of their intellectual property because the teams “can function only as one source of economic power when collectively producing NFL football.” Id., at 743. The court noted that football itself can only be carried out jointly. See ibid. (“Asserting that a single football team could produce a football game . . . is a Zen riddle: Who wins when a football team plays itself ”). Moreover, “NFL teams share a vital economic interest in collectively promoting  NFL football . . . [to] compet[e] with other forms of entertainment.” Ibid. “It thus follows,” the court found, “that only one source of economic power controls the promotion of NFL football,” and “it makes little sense to assert that each individual team has the authority, if not the responsibility, to promote the jointly produced NFL football.” Ibid. Recognizing that NFL teams have “license[d] their intellectual property collectively” since 1963, the court held that § 1 did not apply. Id., at 744.

We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 933, 129 S. Ct. 2859, 174 L. Ed. 2d 575 (2009).

II 

As the case comes to us, we have only a narrow issue to decide: whether the NFL respondents are capable of engaging in a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” as defined by § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, or, as we have sometimes phrased it, whether the alleged activity by the NFL respondents “must be viewed as that of a single enterprise for purposes of § 1.” Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984).

Taken literally, the applicability of § 1 to “every contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” could be understood to cover every conceivable agreement, whether it be a group of competing firms fixing prices or a single firm's chief executive telling her subordinate how to price their company's product. But  even though, “read literally,” § 1 would address “the entire body of private contract,” that is not what the statute means. National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); see also Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, 547 U.S. 1, 5, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2006) (“This Court has not taken a literal approach to this language”); cf. Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918) (reasoning that the term “restraint of trade” in § 1 cannot possibly refer to any restraint on competition because “[e]very agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence”). Not every instance  of cooperation between two people is a potential  “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” 15 U.S.C. § 1.

 The meaning of the term “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” is informed by the “ 'basic distinction' ” in the Sherman Act “ 'between concerted and independent action' ” that distinguishes § 1 of the Sherman Act from § 2. Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984)). Section 1 applies only to concerted action that restrains trade. Section 2, by contrast, covers both concerted and independent action, but only if that action “monopolize[s],” 15 U.S.C. § 2, or “threatens actual monopolization,” Copperweld,467 U.S., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, a category that is narrower than restraint of trade.Monopoly power may be equally harmful whether it is the product of joint action or individual action.

Congress used this distinction between concerted and independent action to deter anticompetitive conduct and compensate its victims, without chilling vigorous competition through ordinary business operations. The distinction also avoids judicial scrutiny of routine, internal business decisions.

Thus,  in § 1Congress “treated concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior.” Id., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. This is so because unlike independent action, “[c]oncerted activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk” insofar as it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands.” Id., at 768-769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. And because concerted action is discrete and distinct, a limit on such activity leaves untouched a vast amount of business conduct. As a result, there is less risk of deterring a firm's necessary conduct; courts need only examine discrete agreements; and such conduct may be remedied simply through prohibition.2If Congress prohibited independent action that merely restrains trade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), that prohibition could deter perfectly competitive conduct by firms that are fearful of litigation costs and judicial error. See Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk that the antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive entrepreneur”); cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 441, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978) (“[S]alutary and procompetitive conduct . . . might be shunned by businessmen who chose to be excessively cautious in the face of uncertainty”). Moreover, if every unilateral action that restrained trade were subject to antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be forced to judge almost every internal business decision. See 7 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P1464c, p. 206 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter Areeda & Hovenkamp) (unilateral behavior is “often difficult to evaluate or remedy”). See Areeda & Hovenkamp  P1464c, at 206. Concerted activity is thus “judged more sternly than unilateral activity under § 2,” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. For these reasons, § 1 prohibits any concerted action “in restraint of trade or commerce,” even if the action does not “threate[n] monopolization,” ibid. And therefore, an arrangement must embody concerted action in order to be a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” under § 1.

III 

We have long held that  concerted action under § 1 does not turn simply on whether the parties involved are legally distinct entities. Instead, we have eschewed such formalistic distinctions in favor of a functional consideration of how the parties involved in the alleged anticompetitive conduct actually operate.

As a result, we have repeatedly found instances in which members of a legally single entity violated § 1 when the entity was controlled by a group of competitors and served, in essence, as a vehicle for ongoing concerted activity. In United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967), for example, a group of mattress manufacturers operated and controlled Sealy, Inc., a company that licensed the Sealy trademark to the manufacturers, and dictated that each operate within a specific geographic area. Id., at 352-353, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. The Government alleged that the licensees and Sealy were conspiring in violation of § 1, and we agreed. Id., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. We explained that “[w]e seek the central substance of the situation” and  therefore “we are moved by the identity of the persons who act, rather than the label of their hats.” Id., at 353, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. We thus held that Sealy was not a “separate entity, but . . . an instrumentality of the individual manufacturers.” Id., at 356, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. In similar circumstances, we have found other formally distinct business organizations covered by § 1. See, e.g.,Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery & Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985); National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984)(NCAA);United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972); Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (1945); id.,  at 26, 65 S. Ct. 1416, 89 L. Ed. 2013 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); United States v. Terminal R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 32 S. Ct. 507, 56 L. Ed. 810 (1912); see also Rock, Corporate Law Through an Antitrust Lens, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 497, 506-510 (1992) (discussing cases). We have similarly looked past the form of a legally “single entity” when competitors were part of professional organization3See, e.g., FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986); Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U.S. 332, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982); National Soc. of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978); Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1975). or trade groups.4See, e.g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988); Radiant Burners, Inc. v. Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co., 364 U.S. 656, 81 S. Ct. 365, 5 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1961)(per curiam);Fashion Originators' Guild of America, Inc. v. FTC, 312 U.S. 457, 61 S. Ct. 703, 85 L. Ed. 949, 32 F.T.C. 1856 (1941).

 Conversely,  there is not necessarily concerted action simply because more than one legally distinct entity is involved. Although, under a now-defunct doctrine known as the “intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine,” we once treated cooperation between legally separate entities as necessarily covered by § 1, we now embark on a more functional analysis.

The roots of this functional analysis can be found in the very decision that established the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine. In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010 (1947), we observed that “corporate interrelationships . . .  are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act” because the Act “is aimed at substance rather than form.” Id., at 227, 67 S. Ct. 1560, 91 L. Ed. 2010. We nonetheless held that cooperation between legally separate entities was necessarily covered by § 1 because an unreasonable restraint of trade “may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.” Ibid.; see also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211, 215, 71 S. Ct. 259, 95 L. Ed. 219 (1951).

The decline of the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine began in Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler & Smith Citrus Products Co., 370 U.S. 19, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1962). In that case, several agricultural cooperatives that were owned by the same farmers were sued for violations of § 1 of the Sherman Act. Id., at 24-25, 82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305. Applying a specific immunity provision for agricultural cooperatives, we held that the three cooperatives were “in practical effect” one “organization,” even though the controlling farmers “have formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities.” Id., at 29,  82 S. Ct. 1130, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305. “To hold otherwise,” we explained, “would be to impose grave legal consequences upon organizational distinctions that are of de minimis meaning and effect” insofar as “use of separate corporations had [no] economic significance.” Ibid.

Next, in United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1975), a large bank, Citizens and Southern (C&S), formed a holding company that operated de facto suburban branch banks in the Atlanta area through ownership of the maximum amount of stock in each local branch that was allowed by law, “ownership of much of the remaining stock by parties friendly to C, use by the suburban banks of the C logogram and all of C's banking services, and close C oversight of the operation and governance of the suburban banks.” Id., at 89, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41 (footnote omitted). The Government challenged the cooperation between the banks. In our analysis, we observed that “ 'corporate interrelationships . . .  are not determinative,' id., at 116, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, “looked to economic substance,” and observed that “because the sponsored banks were not set up to be competitors, § 1 did not compel them to compete.” Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1463g, at 200-201; see also Citizens & Southern, 422 U.S., at 119-120, 95 S. Ct. 2099, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41; Areeda, Intraenterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 451, 461 (1983).

We finally reexamined the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine in Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984), and concluded that it was inconsistent with the “ 'basic distinction between concerted and independent action.' Id., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. Considering it “perfectly plain that  an internal agreement to implement a single, unitary firm's policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that § 1 was designed to police,” id., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, we held that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary “are incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of § 1 of the Sherman Act,” id., at 777, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. We explained that although a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are “separate” for the purposes of incorporation or formal title, they are controlled by a single center of decisionmaking and they control a single aggregation of economic power. Joint conduct  by two such entities does not “depriv[e] the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, and as a result, an agreement between them does not constitute a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” for the purposes of § 1.5This focus on “substance, not form,” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 773, n. 21, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, can also be seen in our cases about whether a company and its agent are capable of conspiring under § 1. See, e.g., Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 377 U.S. 13, 20-21, 84 S. Ct. 1051, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1964); see also E. Elhauge & D. Geradin, Global Antitrust Law and Economics 787-788, and n. 7 (2007) (hereinafter Elhauge & Geradin) (explaining the functional difference between Simpson and United States v. General Elec. Co., 272 U.S. 476, 47 S. Ct. 192, 71 L. Ed. 362 (1926), in which we treated a similar agreement as beyond the reach of § 1).

 IV 

As Copperweld exemplifies,  “substance, not form, should determine whether a[n] . . . entity is capable of conspiring under § 1.” 467 U.S., at 773, n. 21, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. This inquiry is sometimes described as asking whether the alleged conspirators are a single entity. That is perhaps a misdescription, however, because the question is not whether the defendant is a legally single entity or has a single name; nor is the question whether the parties involved “seem” like one firm or multiple firms in any metaphysical sense. The key is whether the alleged “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” is concerted action--that is, whether it joins together separate decisionmakers. The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether there is a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” amongst “separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,” id., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, such that the agreement “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” ibid., and therefore of “diversity of entrepreneurial interests,” Fraser v. Major League Soccer, L. L. C.,284 F.3d 47, 57 (CA1 2002) (Boudin, C. J.), and thus of actual or potential competition, see Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133, 1148-1149 (CA9 2003) (Kozinski, J.); Rothery Storage & Van Co. v. Atlas Van Lines, Inc., 792 F.2d 210, 214-215, 253 U.S. App. D.C. 142 (CADC 1986) (Bork, J.); see also Areeda & Hovenkamp P1462b, at 193-194 (noting that the “central evil addressed by Sherman Act § 1 is the “elimin[ation of] competition that would otherwise exist”).

Thus,  while the president and a vice president of a firm could (and regularly do) act in combination, their joint action generally is not the sort of “combination” that § 1 is intended to cover. Such agreements might be described as “really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a single enterprise.” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 767, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. Nor, for this reason, does § 1 cover “internally coordinated conduct of a corporation and one of its unincorporated divisions,” id., at 770, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, because  “[a] division within a corporate structure pursues the common interests of the whole,” ibid., and therefore “coordination between a corporation and its division does not represent a sudden joining of two independent sources of economic power previously pursuing separate interests,” id., at 770-771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. Nor, for the same reasons, is “the coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary” covered. See id., at 771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. They “have a complete unity of interest” and thus “[w]ith or without a formal 'agreement,' the subsidiary acts for the benefit of the parent, its sole shareholder.” Ibid.

 Because the inquiry is one of competitive reality, it is not determinative that two parties to an alleged § 1 violation are legally distinct entities. Nor, however, is it determinative that two legally distinct entities have organized themselves under a single umbrella or into a structured joint venture. The question is whether the agreement joins together “independent centers of decisionmaking.” Id., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. If it does, the entities are capable of conspiring under § 1, and the court must decide whether the restraint of trade is an unreasonable and therefore illegal one.

 V 

The NFL teams do not possess either the unitary decisionmaking quality or the single aggregation of economic power characteristic of independent action. Each of the teams is a substantial, independently owned, and independently managed business. “[T]heir general corporate actions are guided or determined” by “separate corporate consciousnesses,” and “[t]heir objectives are” not “common.” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628; see also North American Soccer League v. NFL, 670 F.2d 1249, 1252 (CA2 1982) (discussing ways that “the financial performance of each team, while related to that of the others, does not . . . necessarily rise and fall with that of the others”). The teams compete with one another, not only on the playing field, but to attract fans, for gate  receipts, and for contracts with managerial and playing personnel. See Brown v. Pro Football, Inc., 518 U.S. 231, 249, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1996); Sullivan v. NFL, 34 F.3d 1091, 1098 (CA1 1994); Mid-South Grizzlies v. NFL, 720 F.2d 772, 787 (CA3 1983); cf. NCAA, 468 U.S., at 99, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70.

Directly relevant to this case, the teams compete in the market for intellectual property. To a firm making hats, the Saints and the Colts are two potentially competing suppliers of valuable trademarks. When each NFL team licenses its intellectual property, it is not pursuing the “common interests of the whole” league but is instead pursuing interests of each “corporation itself,” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 770, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628; teams are acting as “separate economic actors pursuing separate economic interests,” and each team therefore is a potential “independent cente[r] of decisionmaking,” id., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. Decisions by NFL teams to license their separately owned trademarks collectively and to only one vendor are decisions that “depriv[e] the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” ibid., and therefore of actual or potential competition. See NCAA, 468 U.S., at 109, n. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (observing a possible § 1 violation if two separately owned companies sold their separate products through a “single selling agent”); cf. Areeda & Hovenkamp P1478a, at 318 (“Obviously, the most significant competitive threats arise when joint venture participants are actual or potential competitors”).

In defense, respondents argue that by forming NFLP, they have formed a single entity, akin to a merger, and market their NFL brands through a single outlet. But it is not dispositive that the teams have organized and own a legally separate entity that centralizes the management of their intellectual property.  An ongoing § 1 violation cannot evade § 1 scrutiny simply by giving the ongoing violation a name and label. “Perhaps every agreement and combination in restraint of trade could be so labeled.” Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 598, 71 S. Ct. 971, 95 L. Ed. 1199 (1951).

 The NFL respondents may be similar in some sense to a single enterprise that owns several pieces of intellectual property and licenses them jointly, but they are not similar in the relevant functional sense. Although NFL teams have common interests such as promoting the NFL brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in licensing team trademarks are not necessarily aligned. See generally Hovenkamp, Exclusive Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev. 1, 52-61 (1995); Shishido, Conflicts of Interest and Fiduciary Duties in the Operation of a Joint Venture, 39 Hastings L. J. 63, 69-81 (1987). Common interests in the NFL brand “partially unit[e] the economic interests of the parent firms,” Broadley, Joint Ventures and Antitrust Policy, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 1521, 1526 (1982) (emphasis added), but the teams still have distinct, potentially competing interests.

It may be, as respondents argue, that NFLP “has served as the 'single driver' ” of the teams' “promotional vehicle, 'pursu[ing] the common interests of the whole.' ” Brief for NFL Respondents 28 (quoting Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 770-771, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628; brackets in original). But illegal restraints often are in the common interests of the parties to the restraint, at the expense of those who are not parties. It is true, as respondents describe, that they have for some time marketed their trademarks jointly. But  a history of concerted activity does not immunize conduct from § 1 scrutiny. “Absence of actual competition may simply be a manifestation of the anticompetitive agreement itself.” Freeman, 322 F.3d, at 1149.

Respondents argue that nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals held, they constitute a single entity because without their cooperation, there would be no NFL football. It is true that “the clubs that make up a professional sports league are not completely independent economic competitors, as they depend upon a degree of cooperation for economic survival.” Brown, 518 U.S., at 248, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 l. Ed. 2d 521. But the Court of Appeals' reasoning is unpersuasive.

 The justification for cooperation is not relevant to whether that cooperation  is concerted or independent action.6As discussed infra, necessity of cooperation is a factor relevant to whether the agreement is subject to the Rule of Reason. See NCAA, 468 U.S. 85, 101, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984) (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising college football games are subject to Rule of Reason analysis for the “critical” reason that “horizontal restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all”). A “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy,” § 1, that is necessary or useful to a joint venture is still a “contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy” if it “deprives the marketplace of independent centers of decisionmaking,” Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 769, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628. See NCAA,468 U.S., at 113, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (“[J]oint ventures  have no immunity from antitrust laws”). Any joint venture involves multiple sources of economic power cooperating to produce a product. And for many such ventures, the participation of others is necessary. But that does not mean that necessity of cooperation transforms concerted action into independent action; a nut and a bolt can only operate together, but an agreement between nut and bolt manufacturers is still subject to § 1 analysis. Nor does it mean that once a group of firms agree to produce a joint product, cooperation amongst those firms must be treated as independent conduct. The mere fact that the teams operate jointly in some sense does not mean that they are immune.7In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was necessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a football game, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary to produce a game. Moreover, even if leaguewide agreements are necessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity in marketing intellectual property is necessary to produce football.The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for conduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that coordinated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a single NFL brand that competes against other forms of entertainment. But defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the horse: Of course the NFL produces NFL football; but that does not mean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from § 1 scrutiny. Members of any cartel could insist that their cooperation is necessary to produce the “cartel product” and compete with other products.

 The question whether NFLP decisions can constitute concerted activity covered by § 1 is closer than whether decisions made directly by the 32 teams are covered by § 1. This is so both because NFLP is a separate corporation with its own management and because the record indicates that most of the revenues generated by NFLP are shared by the teams on an equal basis. Nevertheless we think it clear that for the same reasons the 32 teams' conduct is covered by § 1, NFLP's actions also are subject to § 1, at least with regards to its marketing of property owned by the separate teams. NFLP's licensing decisions are made by the 32 potential competitors, and each of them actually owns its share of the jointly managed assets. Cf. Sealy, 388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238. Apart from their agreement to cooperate in exploiting those assets, including their decisions as the NFLP, there would be nothing to prevent each of the teams from making its own market decisions relating to purchases of apparel and headwear, to the sale of such items, and to the granting of licenses to use its trademarks.

 We generally treat agreements within a single firm as independent action on the presumption that the components of the firm will act to maximize the firm's profits. But in rare cases, that presumption does not hold. Agreements made within a firm can constitute concerted action covered by § 1 when the parties to the agreement act on interests separate from those of the firm itself,8See Areeda & Hovenkamp P1471; Elhauge & Geradin 786-787, and n. 6; see also Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk Valley Medical Assocs., Inc., 996 F.2d 537, 544 (CA2 1993); Bolt v. Halifax Hospital Medical Center, 891 F.2d 810, 819 (CA11 1990); Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hospital, 945 F.2d 696, 706 (CA4 1991); Motive Parts Warehouse v. Facet Enterprises,774 F.2d 380, 387-388 (CA10 1985); Victorian House, Inc. v. Fisher Camuto Corp., 769 F.2d 466, 469 (CA8 1985); Weiss v. York Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 828 (CA3 1984). and the intrafirm agreements may simply be a formalistic shell for ongoing concerted action.  See, e.g., Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S., at 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515; Sealy,388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238.

For that reason, decisions by NFLP regarding the teams' separately owned intellectual property constitute concerted action. Thirty-two teams operating independently through the vehicle of NFLP are not like the components of a single firm that act to maximize the firm's profits. The teams remain separately controlled, potential competitors with economic interests that are distinct from NFLP's financial well-being. See generally Hovenkamp, 1995 Colum. Bus. L. Rev., at 52-61. Unlike typical decisions by corporate shareholders, NFLP licensing decisions effectively require the assent of more than a mere majority of shareholders. And each team's decision reflects not only an interest in NFLP's profits but also an interest in the team's individual profits. See generally Shusido,39 Hastings L. J., at 69-71. The 32 teams capture individual economic benefits separate and apart from NFLP profits as a result of the decisions they make for NFLP. NFLP's decisions thus affect each team's profits from licensing its own intellectual property. “Although the business interests of” the teams “will often coincide with those of ” NFLP “as an entity in itself, that commonality of interest exists in every cartel.” Los Angeles Memorial  Coliseum Comm'n v. NFL, 726 F.2d 1381, 1389 (CA9 1984) (emphasis added). In making the relevant licensing decisions, NFLP is therefore “an instrumentality” of the teams. Sealy,388 U.S., at 352-354, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238; see also Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S., at 609, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515.

If the fact that potential competitors shared in profits or losses from a venture meant that the venture was immune from § 1, then any cartel “could evade the antitrust laws simply by creating a 'joint venture' to serve as the exclusive seller of their competing products.” Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 335 (CA2 2008) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment). “So long as no agreement,” other than one made by the cartelists sitting  on the board of the joint venture, “explicitly listed the prices to be charged, the companies could act as monopolies through the 'joint venture.' ” Ibid. (Indeed, a joint venture with a single management structure is generally a better way to operate a cartel because it decreases the risks of a party to an illegal agreement defecting from that agreement). However,  competitors “cannot simply get around” antitrust liability by acting “through a third-party intermediary or 'joint venture'.” Id., at 336.9 For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to pass upon the Government's position that entities are incapable of conspiring under § 1 if they “have effectively merged the relevant aspect of their operations, thereby eliminating actual and potential competition . . . in that operational sphere” and “the challenged restraint [does] not significantly affect actual or potential competition . . . outside their merged operations.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17. The Government urges that the choices “to offer only a blanket license” and “to have only a single headwear licensee” might not constitute concerted action under its test. Id., at 32. However, because the teams still own their own trademarks and are free to market those trademarks as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements amongst potential competitors and would constitute concerted action under the Government's own standard. At any point, the teams could decide to license their own trademarks. It is significant, moreover, that the teams here control NFLP. The two choices that the Government might treat as independent action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for all functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with potentially competing interests.

VI 

Football teams that need to cooperate are not trapped by antitrust law. “[T]he special characteristics of this industry may provide a justification” for many kinds of agreements. Brown, 518 U.S., at 252, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521 (Stevens, J., dissenting). The fact that NFL teams share an interest in making the entire league successful and profitable, and that they must cooperate in the production and scheduling of games, provides a perfectly sensible justification for making a host of collective decisions. But the conduct at issue in this case is still concerted  activity under the Sherman Act that is subject to § 1 analysis.

 When “restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,” per se rules of illegality are inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged according to the flexible Rule of Reason.10Justice Brandeis provided the classic formulation of the Rule of Reason in Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918):   “ The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.” See also Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885-887, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007); National Soc. of Professional Engineers,435 U.S., at 688-691, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637.NCAA, 468 U.S., at 101, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70; see id., at 117 (“Our decision not to apply a per se rule to this case rests in large part on our recognition that a certain degree of cooperation is necessary if the type of competition that petitioner and its member institutions seek to market is to be preserved”); see also Dagher, 547 U.S., at 6, 126 S. Ct. 1276, 164 L. Ed. 2d 1. In such instances, the agreement is likely to survive the Rule of Reason. See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 23, 99 S. Ct. 1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (“Joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements are also not usually unlawful. . . where the agreement . . . is necessary to market the product at all”). And depending upon the concerted activity in question, the Rule of Reason may not require a detailed analysis; it “can sometimes be applied in the twinkling of an eye.” NCAA, 468 U.S., at 110, n. 39, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70.

Other features of the NFL may also save agreements amongst the teams. We have recognized,  for example, “that the interest in maintaining a competitive balance” among “athletic teams is legitimate and important,” id. at 117, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70. While that same interest applies to the teams in the NFL, it does not justify treating them as a single entity for § 1 purposes when it comes to the marketing of the teams' individually owned intellectual property. It is, however, unquestionably an interest that may well justify a variety of collective decisions made by the teams. What role it properly plays in applying the Rule of Reason to the allegations in this case is a matter to be considered on remand.

* * * 

Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code provides bankruptcy protection to “individual[s] with regular income” whose debts fall within statutory limits. 11 U.S.C. §§ 101(30), 109(e). Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors, see §§ 704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to keep their property, but they must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income, see §§ 1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a Chapter 13 debtor's plan. § 1322(a)(1); see also 28 U.S.C. § 586(a)(3).

Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under which a bankruptcy court “shall” and “may not” confirm a plan. § 1325(a), (b). If an unsecured creditor or the bankruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, § 1325(b)(1) requires the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to pay all “projected disposable income” to be received by the debtor over the duration of the plan.

We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court should calculate a debtor's “projected disposable income.” Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the “mechanical approach,” while most have adopted what has been called the “forward-looking approach.” We hold that the “forward-looking approach” is correct.

I 

As previously noted, § 1325 provides that if a trustee or an unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debtor's plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or “provides that all of the debtor's projected disposable income to be received” over the duration of the plan “will be applied to make payments” in accordance with the terms of the plan. 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(1); see also § 1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code) loosely defined “disposable income” as “income which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended” for the “maintenance or support of the debtor,” for qualifying charitable contributions, or for business expenditures. §§ 1325(b)(2)(A), (B).

The Code did not define the term “projected disposable income,” and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable income. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determined what portion of the result was “excess” or “disposable.” See 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy § 164.1, p. 164-1, and n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.)) (citing cases).

In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took into account foreseeable changes in a debtor's income or expenses.SeeIn re Heath, 182 B. R. 557, 559-561 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA9 1995); In re Richardson, 283 B. R. 783, 799 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2002); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Accord, 1 Lundin § 35.10, at 35-14 (2000 ed.) (“The debtor should take some care to project estimated future income on Schedule I to include anticipated increases or decreases [in income] so that the schedule will be consistent with any evidence of income the debtor would offer at a contested confirmation hearing”).

BAPCPA left the term “projected disposable income” undefined but specified in some detail how “disposable income” is to be calculated. “Disposable income” is now defined as “current monthly income received by the debtor” less “amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” for the debtor's maintenance and support, for qualifying charitable contributions, and for business expenditures. §§ 1325(b)(2)(A)(i) and (ii) (2006 ed.). “Current monthly income,” in turn, is calculated by averaging the debtor's monthly income during what the parties refer to as the 6-month lookback period, which generally consists of the six full months preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition. See§ 101(10A)(A)(i).1 However, if a debtor does not file the required schedule (Schedule I), the bankruptcy court may select a different 6-month period. See§ 101(10A)(A)(ii). The phrase “amounts reasonably necessary to be expended” in § 1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose income is below the median for his or her State, the phrase includes the full amount needed for “maintenance or support,” see § 1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with income that exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included,2 The formula for above-median-income debtors is known as the “means test” and is reflected in a schedule (Form 22C) that a Chapter 13 debtor must file. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. Official Form 22C (2010); In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 606, n. 1, 608-609 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008). see §§ 707(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 1325(b)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).

A 

Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a one-time buyout from her former employer, and this payment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to $11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84, 107. As a result of these payments, respondent's current monthly income, as averaged from April through October 2006, was $5,343.70—a figure that exceeds the median income for a family of one in Kansas. Seeid., at 78. Respondent's monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to § 707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. Id., at 83. She reported a monthly “disposable income” of $1,114.98 on Form 22C. Ibid.

On the form used for reporting monthly income (Schedule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per month—which is below the state median. Id., at 66; see also id., at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly expenses of $1,772.97. Id., at 68. Subtracting the Schedule J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly disposable income of $149.03.

Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months. Seeid., at 93. Petitioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the amount respondent proposed to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against her, see § 1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner's view, respondent was not committing all of her “projected disposable income” to the repayment of creditors, see § 1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to calculate projected disposable income was simply to multiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the number of months in the commitment period. Employing this mechanical approach, petitioner calculated that creditors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly payments of $756 for a period of 60 months. Id., at 108. There is no dispute that respondent's actual income was insufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4.

B 

The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent's proposed monthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan period. In re Lanning, No. 06-41037 etc., 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 1639, 2007 WL 1451999, *8  (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view that the word “projected” in § 1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts “to consider at confirmation the debtor's actual income as it is reported on Schedule I.” 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 1639, [WL] at *5 (emphasis added). This conclusion was warranted by the text of § 1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bankruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating finances in the six months before filing. Ibid.

Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed. In re Lanning, 380 B. R. 17, 19 (2007). The panel noted that, although Congress redefined “disposable income” in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre-existing term “projected disposable income.” Id., at 24. Thus, the panel concluded, there was no reason to believe that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice under which bankruptcy courts determined projected disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but considered other evidence when there was reason to believe that the schedules did not reflect a debtor's actual ability to pay. Ibid.

The Tenth Circuit affirmed. In re Lanning, 545 F.3d 1269, 1270 (2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calculating “projected disposable income,” should begin with the “presumption” that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct, but the court concluded that this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtor's circumstances. Id., at 1278-1279.

This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558 U.S. 989, 130 S. Ct. 487, 175 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2009).

A 

The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of § 1325's reference to “projected disposable income.” Petitioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that “projected disposable income” means past average monthly disposable income multiplied by the number of months in a debtor's plan. Respondent, who favors the forward-looking approach, agrees that the method outlined by petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she argues that in exceptional cases, where significant changes in a debtor's financial circumstances are known or virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to make an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the stronger argument.

First, respondent's argument is supported by the ordinary meaning of the term “projected.” “When terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.” Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S. Ct. 788, 130 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1995). Here, the term “projected” is not defined, and in ordinary usage future occurrences are not “projected” based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself. For example, projections concerning a company's future sales or the future cash flow from a license take into account anticipated events that may change past trends. See, e.g., Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 316, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007) (describing adjustments to “projected sales” in light of falling demand); Innovair Aviation, Ltd. v. United States, 83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504-506 (2008) (calculating projected cash flow and noting that past sales are “not necessarily the number of sales” that will be made in the future). On the night of an election, experts do not “project” the percentage of the votes that a candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candidate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the first few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not project that a team's winning percentage at the end of a new season will be the same as the team's winning percentage last year or the team's winning percentage at the end of the first month of competition. While a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome. SeeIn re Kibbe, 361 B. R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA1 2007)(per curiam) (contrasting “multiplied,” which “requires only mathematical acumen,” with “projected,” which requires “mathematic acumen adjusted by deliberation and discretion”).

Second, the word “projected” appears in many federal statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple multiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 defined “projected national yield,” “projected county yield,” and “projected farm yield” as entailing historical averages “adjusted for abnormal weather conditions,” “trends in yields,” and “any significant changes in production practices.” 7 U.S.C. §§ 1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J), (K).3See also, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1364(a), (c)(2) (requiring the triennial immigration-impact report to include information “projected for the succeeding five-year period, based on reasonable estimates substantiated by the best available evidence”); 10 U.S.C. § 2433a(a)(2)(B) (2006 ed., Supp. III) (“projected cost of completing the [defense acquisition] program based on reasonable modification of [current] requirements”); 15 U.S.C. § 719c(c)(2) (2006 ed.) (“projected natural gas supply and demand”); 25 U.S.C. §§ 2009(c)(1), (2) (requiring the Director of the Office of Indian Education Programs to submit an annual report containing certain projections and “a description of the methods and formulas used to calculate the amounts projected”).

By contrast, we need look no further than the Bankruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate simple multiplication, it does so unambiguously—most commonly by using the term “multiplied.” See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. § 1325(b)(3) (“current monthly income, when multiplied by 12”); §§ 704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same); §§ 707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (“multiplied by 60”). Accord, 2 U.S.C. § 58(b)(1)(B) (“multiplied by the number of months in such year”); 5 U.S.C. § 8415(a) (“multiplied by such individual's total service”); 42 U.S.C. §§ 403(f)(3) (“multiplied by the number of months in such year”).

Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the “forward-looking” approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor's current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income. See, e.g., In re Killough, 900 F.2d 61, 62-63 (CA5 1990)(per curiam); In re Anderson, 21 F.3d 355, 357 (CA9 1994); In re Solomon, 67 F.3d 1128, 1132 (CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin § 164.1, at 164-1 (2000 ed.) (“Most courts focus on the debtor's current income and extend current income (and expenditures) over the life of the plan to calculate projected disposable income”). But courts also had discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor's income. SeeHeath, 182 B. R., at 559-561; Richardson, 283 B. R., at 799; In re James, 260 B. R. 498, 514-515 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Idaho 2001); In re Jobe, 197 B. R. 823, 826-827 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Tex. 1996); In re Crompton, 73 B. R. 800, 808 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Pa. 1987); see also In re Schyma, 68 B. R. 52, 63 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Minn. 1985) (“[T]he prospect of dividends . . . is not so certain as to require Debtors or the Court to consider them as regular or disposable income”); In re Krull, 54 B. R. 375, 378 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1985) (“Since there are no changes in income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must simply multiply the debtor's current disposable income by 36 in order to determine his 'projected' income”).4 When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on possible changes in a debtor's future income or expenses, they did so because the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they concluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechanical approach. In In re Solomon, 67 F.3d 1128 (1995), for example, the Fourth Circuit refused to make such an adjustment because it deemed disbursements from an individual retirement account during the plan period to be “speculative” and “hypothetical.” Id., at 1132. There is no reason to assume that the result would have been the same if future disbursements had been more assured. That was certainly true of In re Killough, 900 F.2d 61 (1990) (per curiam), in which the Fifth Circuit declined to require inclusion of overtime pay in projected disposable income because it “was not definite enough.” Id., at 65; see also id., at 66 (“[T]here may be instances where income obtained through working overtime can and should appropriately be included in a debtor's projected and disposable income”). See also Education Assistance Corp. v. Zellner, 827 F.2d 1222, 1226 (CA8 1987) (affirming bankruptcy court's exclusion of future tax returns and salary increases from debtor's projected disposable income because they were “speculative”). This judicial discretion was well documented in contemporary bankruptcy treatises. See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 1325.08[4][a], p. 1325-50 (rev. 15th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Collier) (“As a practical matter, unless there are changes which can be clearly foreseen, the court must simply multiply the debtor's current monthly income by 36 and determine whether the amount to be paid under the plan equals or exceeds that amount” (emphasis added)); 3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice § 75.10, p. 64 (1991) (“It has been held that the court should focus upon present monthly income and expenditures and, absent extraordinary circumstances, project these current amounts over the life of the plan to determine projected disposable income” (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin § 164.1, at 164-28 to 164-31 (2000 ed.) (describing how reported decisions treated anticipated changes in income, particularly where such changes were “too speculative to be projected”); see also In re Greer, 388 B. R. 889, 892 (Bkrtcy. Ct. CD Ill. 2008) (“ 'As a practical matter, unless there are changes which can be clearly foreseen, the court must simply multiply the debtor's current monthly income by thirty-six' ” (quoting 5 Collier ¶ 1325.08[4][a] (15th ed. rev. 1995))); James, supra, at 514 (same) (quoting 8 Id., ¶ 1325.08[4][a] (rev. 15th ed. 2000)); Crompton, supra, at 808 (same) (citing 5 Collier ¶ 1325.08[4][a], [b], at 1325-47 to 1325-48(rev. 15th ed. 1986)). Accord, 8 Collier ¶ 1325.08[4][b], at 1325-53 (rev. 15th ed. 2007) (“As with the income side of the budget, the court must simply use the debtor's current expenses, unless a change in them is virtually certain” (emphasis added)). Indeed, petitioner concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to BAPCPA. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.

Pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice is telling because we “ ' "will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure." ' "Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.S. 443, 454, 127 S. Ct. 1199, 167 L. Ed. 2d 178 (2007); Lamie v. United States Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 539, 124 S. Ct. 1023, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1024 (2004); Cohen v. de la Cruz, 523 U.S. 213, 221, 118 S. Ct. 1212, 140 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1998); see also Grogan v. Garner, 498 U.S. 279, 290, 111 S. Ct. 654, 112 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1991); Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.S. 36, 47, 107 S. Ct. 353, 93 L. Ed. 2d 216 (1986). Congress did not amend the term “projected disposable income” in 2005, and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely acknowledged and well-documented view that courts may take into account known or virtually certain changes to debtors' income or expenses when projecting disposable income. In light of this historical practice, we would expect that, had Congress intended for “projected” to carry a specialized—and indeed, unusual—meaning in Chapter 13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., e.g., 26 U.S.C. §§ 279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining “projected earnings” as reflecting a 3-year historical average).

B 

The [mechanical] approach also clashes repeatedly with the terms of 11 U.S.C. § 1325.

First, § 1325(b)(1)(B)'s reference to projected disposable income “to be received in the applicable commitment period” strongly favors the forward-looking approach. There is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive far less than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, so petitioner's projection does not accurately reflect “income to be received” during that period. SeeIn re Nowlin, 576 F.3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of the statute when a debtor's current disposable income is substantially higher than the income that the debtor predictably will receive during the plan period. SeeKawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57, 62, 118 S. Ct. 974, 140 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1998) (“[W]e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Second, § 1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan,” which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and becomes binding, see § 1327(a). Had Congress intended for projected disposable income to be nothing more than a multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no reason why Congress would not have required courts to determine that value as of the filing date of the plan. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition). In the very next section of the Code, for example, Congress specified that a debtor shall commence payments “not later than 30 days after the date of the filing of the plan.” § 1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Congress' decision to require courts to measure projected disposable income “as of the effective date of the plan” is more consistent with the view that Congress expected courts to consider postfiling information about the debtor's financial circumstances. See545 F.3d at 1279 (“[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured creditors 'as of the effective date of the plan' suggests consideration of the debtor's actual financial circumstances as of the effective date of the plan”).

Third, the requirement that projected disposable income “will be applied to make payments” is most naturally read to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors in the calculated monthly amounts. § 1325(b)(1)(B). But when, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks the means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow command.

C 

The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical approach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now provides a detailed and precise definition of “disposable income,” proponents of the mechanical approach maintain that any departure from this method leaves that definition “ 'with no apparent purpose.' In re Kagenveama, 541 F.3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the important role that the statutory formula for calculating “disposable income” plays under the forward-looking approach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case, a court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing more is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court may go further and take into account other known or virtually certain information about the debtor's future income or expenses.5 For the same reason, the phrase “[f]or purposes of this subsection” in § 1325(b)(2) is not rendered superfluous by the forward-looking approach.

Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a rebuttable “presumption” that the figure produced by the mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor's “projected disposable income.” See545 F.3d at 1278-1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference to any such presumption but that related Code provisions expressly create other rebuttable presumptions. See§§ 707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the Code.

The Tenth Circuit's analysis, however, simply heeds the ordinary meaning of the term “projected.” As noted, a person making a projection uses past occurrences as a starting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Circuit prescribed. See, e.g., Nowlin, supra, at 260, 263.

Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is consistent with § 1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to “projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)).” This cross-reference, petitioner argues, shows that Congress intended for the term “projected disposable income” to incorporate, presumably in all contexts, the defined term “disposable income.” It is evident that § 1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term “disposable income,” see § 1325(b)(2), but that fact offers no insight into the meaning of the word “projected” in §§ 1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a result of this crossreference—particularly where both §§ 1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected disposable income “to be received” during the relevant period. Seesupra, at 517–518, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35.

Petitioner also notes that § 707 allows courts to take “special circumstances” into consideration, but that § 1325(b)(3) incorporates § 707 only with respect to calculating expenses. SeeIn re Wilson, 397 B. R. 299, 314-315 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a “special circumstances” exception should not be inferred with respect to the debtor's income. We decline to infer from § 1325's incorporation of § 707 that Congress intended to eliminate, sub silentio, the discretion that courts previously exercised when projecting disposable income to account for known or virtually certain changes. Accord, In re Liverman, 383 B. R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008).

D 

In cases in which a debtor's disposable income during the 6-month look back period is either substantially lower or higher than the debtor's disposable income during the plan period, the mechanical approach would produce senseless results  that we do not think Congress intended. In cases in which the debtor's disposable income is higher during the plan period, the mechanical approach would deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily make. And where, as in the present case, the debtor's disposable income during the plan period is substantially lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter's main eligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is an “individual whose income is sufficiently stable and regular” to allow her “to make payments under a plan,” § 101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in § 109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she could not file a confirmable plan. Under § 1325(a)(6), a plan cannot be confirmed unless “the debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan.” And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not possibly make the payments that the mechanical approach prescribes.

In order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors, petitioner advances several possible escape strategies. He proposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by the mechanical approach, and in any event none of the maneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.

1 

Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the 6-month lookback period. We see at least two problems with this proposal.

First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor sliding into bankruptcy.

“Potential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a lawyer's office when they are one step from financial Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the debtor's home the next day; the debtor's only car was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor's takehome pay below the ordinary requirements of food and rent. Instantaneous relief is expected, if not necessary.” K. Lundin & W. Brown, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy § 3.1[2] (4th ed. 2009), http: //www.ch13online.com/Subscriber/Chapter_13_Bankruptcy_4th_Lundin_Brown.htm (as visited June 3, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).

See also id., § 38.1 (“Debtor's counsel often has little discretion when to file the Chapter 13 case”).

Second, even when a debtor is able to delay filing a petition, such delay could be risky if it gives the appearance of bad faith. See11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(7)(requiring, as a condition of confirmation, that “the action of the debtor in filing the petition was in good faith”); see also, e.g., In re Myers, 491 F.3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing “ 'the timing of the petition' ” as a factor to be considered in assessing a debtor's compliance with the good-faith requirement). Accord, Neufeld v. Freeman, 794 F.2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986) (a debtor's prepetition conduct may inform the court's good-faith inquiry).

2 

Petitioner next argues that a debtor with unusually high income during the six months prior to the filing of a petition could seek leave to delay filing a schedule of current income (Schedule I) and then ask the bankruptcy court to exercise its authority under § 101(10A)(A)(ii) to select a 6-month period that is more representative of the debtor's future disposable income. We see little merit in this convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would [improperly undermine] what the Code demands. And if, as we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is not needed. In any event, even if this strategy were allowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable income during the plan period is sharply lower than their previous disposable income.6 Under 11 U.S.C. § 521(i)(3), a debtor seeking additional time to file a schedule of income must submit the request within 45 days after filing the petition, and the court may not grant an extension of more than 45 days.

 3 

Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the petition and refile at a later, more favorable date. But petitioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts “generally” do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for Petitioner 53. This questionable stratagem plainly circumvents the statutory limits on a court's ability to shift the lookback period, see supra, at 522, and n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38, and should give debtors pause.7 For example, a debtor otherwise eligible for Chapter 13 protection may become ineligible if “at any time in the preceding 180 days” “the case was dismissed by the court for willful failure of the debtor to abide by orders of the court, or to appear before the court in proper prosecution of the case,” or “the debtor requested and obtained the voluntary dismissal of the case following the filing of a request for relief from the automatic stay provided by section 362 of this title.” § 109(g). Cf. In re Glenn, 288 B. R. 516, 520 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tenn. 2002) (noting that courts should consider, among other factors, “whether this is the first or [a] subsequent filin[g]” when assessing a debtor's compliance with the good-faith requirement).

4 

Petitioner argues that respondent might have been able to obtain relief by filing under Chapter 7 or by converting her Chapter 13 petition to one under Chapter 7. The availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who have above-median incomes is limited. In respondent's case, a presumption of abuse would attach under § 707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, “multiplied by 60,” exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and (II). See also § 707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a petition filed by a debtor “whose debts are primarily consumer debts . . . if it finds that the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter”); App. 86-88 (“Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor under § 342(b) of the Bankruptcy Code) (“If your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size, in some cases, creditors have the right to file a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under § 707(b) of the Code”). Nevertheless, petitioner argues, respondent might have been able to overcome this presumption by claiming that her case involves “special circumstances” within the meaning of § 707(b)(2)(B)(i). Section 707 identifies as examples of “special circumstances” a “serious medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces,” ibid., and petitioner directs us to no authority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in income would qualify as a “special circumstance.” In any event, the “special circumstances” exception is available only to the extent that “there is no reasonable alternative,” ibid., a proposition we reject with our interpretation of § 1325(b)(1) today.8 Petitioner also suggests that some Chapter 13 debtors may be able to plead “special circumstances” on the expense side of the calculation by virtue of BAPCPA's incorporation of the Chapter 7 means test into Chapter 13. See§§ 707(b)(2)(B)(i), (ii). This is no help to debtors like respondent, whose income has changed but whose expenses are constant.

In sum, each of the strategies that petitioner identifies for mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical approach is flawed. There is no reason to think that Congress meant for any of these strategies to operate as a safety valve for the mechanical approach.

IV 

We find petitioner's remaining arguments unpersuasive. Consistent with the text of § 1325 and pre-BAPCPA practice, we hold that when a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor's projected disposable income, the court may account for changes in the debtor's income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation. We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.

These cases concern through bills of lading covering cargo for the entire course of shipment, beginning in a foreign, overseas country and continuing to a final, inland destination in the United States. The voyage here included ocean transit followed by transfer to a rail carrier in this country. The Court addressed similar factual circumstances in Norfolk Southern R. Co. v. James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., 543 U.S. 14, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (2004). In that case the terms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime law and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U.S.C. § 30701. Kirby held that bill of lading provisions permissible under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail carrier, despite contrary state law.

The instant cases present a question neither raised nor addressed inKirby. It is whether the terms of a through bill of lading issued abroad by an ocean carrier can apply to the domestic part of the import's journey by a rail carrier, despite prohibitions or limitations in another federal statute. That statute is known as the Carmack Amendment and it governs the terms of bills of lading issued by domestic rail carriers. 49 U.S.C. § 11706(a).

 I 

Respondents Regal-Beloit Corporation, Victory Fireworks, Inc., PICC Property & Casualty Company Ltd., and Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. are cargo owners or insurance firms that paid losses to cargo owners and succeeded to their rights, all referred to as “cargo owners.” To ship their goods from China to inland destinations in the Midwestern United States, the cargo owners delivered the goods in China to petitioners in No. 08-1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd., and its agent “K” Line America, Inc., both referred to as “K” Line. All agree the relevant contract terms governing the shipment are contained in four  through bills of lading “K” Line issued to the cargo owners. The bills of lading covered the entire course of shipment.

The bills required “K” Line to arrange delivery of the goods from China to their final destinations in the United States, by any mode of transportation of “K” Line's choosing. A bill of lading “records that a carrier has received goods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the terms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract for carriage.” Kirby, 543 U.S., at 18-19, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. A through bill of lading covers both the ocean and inland portions of the transport in a single document. Id., at 25-26, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.

“K” Line's through bills contain five relevant provisions. First, they include a so-called “Himalaya Clause,” which extends the bills' defenses and limitations on liability to parties that sign subcontracts to perform services contemplated by the bills. See id., at 20, and n. 2, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. Second, the bills permit “K” Line “to sub-contract on any terms whatsoever” for the completion of the journey. App. 145. Third, the bills provide that COGSA's terms govern the entire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute will be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state that any action relating to the carriage must be brought in “Tokyo District Court in Japan.” Id., at 144. The forum-selection provision in the last clause gives rise to the dispute here.

“K” Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for the entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No. 08-1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail shipment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped in a “K” Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California, and then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to the final destinations.

In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four different container shipments to “K” Line vessels in Chinese ports. All parties seem to assume that “K” Line safely transported the cargo across the Pacific  Ocean to California.  The containers were then loaded onto a Union Pacific train and that train, or some other train operated by Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly destroying the cargo.

The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The suits named “K” Line and Union Pacific as defendants. Union Pacific removed the suits to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Union Pacific and “K” Line then moved to dismiss based on the parties' Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum-selection clause was reasonable and applied to Union Pacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in “K” Line's bills of lading. 462 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1102-1103 (2006).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded. 557 F.3d 985 (2009). The court concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to the inland portion of an international shipment under a through bill of lading and thus trumped the parties' forum-selection clause. Id., at 994-995. The court noted that this view was consistent with the position taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see id., at 994 (citing Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. v. Union Pacific R. Co., 456 F.3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F.3d, at 994 (citing Shao v. Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., 986 F.2d 700 (CA4 1993); Am. Rd. Serv. Co. v. Conrail., 348 F.3d 565 (CA6 2003); Capitol Converting Equip., Inc. v. LEP Transp., Inc., 965 F.2d 391 (CA7 1992); Altadis USA, Inc. ex rel. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sea Star Line, LLC, 458 F.3d 1288 (CA11 2006)). This Court granted certiorari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland segment of an overseas import shipment under a through bill of lading. 558 U.S. 969, 130 S. Ct. 459, 175 L. Ed. 2d 306 (2009).

  II 

 A 

Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of COGSA is in order; for “K” Line's and Union Pacific's primary contention is that COGSA, not Carmack, controls.  COGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as amended, note following 46 U.S.C. § 30701, p. 1178. It requires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that contains certain terms. § 3(3)-(8), at 1178-1179. Although COGSA imposes some limitations on the parties' authority to adjust liability, it does not limit the parties' ability to adopt forum-selection clauses. See Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U.S. 528, 537-539, 115 S. Ct. 2322, 132 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to shipments from United States ports to ports of foreign countries and vice versa. §§ 1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The statute, however, allows parties “the option of extending [certain COGSA terms] by contract” to cover “the entire period in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier's] responsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.” Kirby, 543 U.S., at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (citing COGSA § 7, at 1180). Ocean carriers, which often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (Maritime Commission), which is responsible for oversight over “common carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign commerce.” 46 U.S.C. § 40101(1).

 B 

The next statute to consider is the Carmack Amendment, § 7, 34 Stat. 595, which governs the terms of bills of lading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first enacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has been altered and recodified over the last century. It now provides, in relevant part, as follows:

 “(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transportation Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part. That rail carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by--“(1) the receiving rail carrier;“(2) the delivering rail carrier; or“(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier.” 49 U.S.C. § 11706; see also § 14706(a) (motor carriers).

 The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier that “receives [property] for transportation under this part” to issue a bill of lading. § 11706(a). The provision “this part” refers to is the STB's jurisdiction over rail transportation within the United States. See § 10501 (2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The STB has “exclusive” jurisdiction to regulate “transportation by rail carriers” between places in the United States as well as between a place “in the United States and a place in a foreign country.” § 10501(a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regulated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to STB rail carrier jurisdiction “on reasonable request,” § 11101(a), at reasonable rates, §§ 10702, 10707(b), 11101(a), (e).

 In cases where it applies, Carmack imposes upon “receiving rail carrier[s]” and “delivering rail carrier[s]” liability for damage caused during the rail route under the bill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the damage. § 11706(a). Carmack's purpose is to relieve cargo owners “of the burden of searching out a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carriers handling an interstate shipment of goods.” Reider v. Thompson, 339 U.S. 113, 119, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (1950). To help achieve this goal, Carmack constrains carriers' ability to limit liability by contract. § 11706(c).

Carmack also limits the parties' ability to choose the venue of their suit:

 “(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought in a district court of the United States or in a State court.“(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought--“(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located; “(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and“(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.” § 11706.

For purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if Carmack's terms apply to the bills of lading here, the cargo owners would have a substantial argument that the Tokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by Carmack's venue provisions. The parties argue about whether  they may contract out of Carmack's venue provisions and other requirements, see §§ 10502, 10709; but in light of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters need not be discussed or further explored.

 III 

In Kirby, an ocean shipping company issued a through bill of lading, agreeing to deliver cargo from Australia to Alabama. Like the through bills in the present cases, the Kirby bill extended COGSA's terms to the inland segment under a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property was damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland rail portion. 543 U.S., at 19-20, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.

Kirby held that the through bill's terms governed under federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws. Id., at 23-27, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. Kirby explained that  “so long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.” Id., at 27, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The Court added that ?[a]pplying state law to cases like this one would undermine the uniformity of general maritime law.” Id., at 28, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. “Confusion and inefficiency will inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a given contract's meaning.” Id., at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The Court noted that its conclusion “reinforce[d] the liability regime Congress established in COGSA,” and explained that COGSA allows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a journey under a through bill of lading. Ibid. Finally, the Court concluded that a contrary holding would defeat “the apparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Ibid.

Much of what the Court said inKirby applies to the present cases. “K” Line issued the through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered such international through bills and decided to permit parties to extend COGSA's terms to the inland domestic segment of the journey. The cargo owners and “K” Line did exactly that in  these cases,  agreeing in the through bills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.

 IV 

The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment, which has its own venue provisions and was not discussed in Kirby, requires a different result. In particular they argue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland segment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection clause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below, this contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text, history, and purposes of Carmack, the Court now holds that  the amendment does not apply to a shipment originating overseas under a single through bill of lading. As inKirby, the terms of the bill govern the parties' rights.

 A 

The text of the statute charts the analytic course.  Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into three parts: (1) receiving rail carriers; (2) delivering rail carriers; and (3) connecting rail carriers. A ?receiving rail carrier” is one that “provid[es] transportation or service . . . for property it receives for transportation under this part.” § 11706(a); see § 11706(a)(1). The provision “this part” refers to is the STB's jurisdiction over rail transportation within the United States. See § 10501. A “delivering rail carrier? “delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part.” § 11706(a); see§ 11706(a)(2). A connecting rail carrier is “another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.” § 11706(a)(3).

 A rail carrier's obligation to issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading is determined by Carmack's first sentence:

“A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part  shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part.” § 11706(a).

This critical first sentence requires a Carmack-compliant bill of lading if two conditions are satisfied. First, the rail carrier must “provid[e] transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB].” Second, that carrier must “receiv[e]” the property “for transportation under this part,” where “this part” is the STB's jurisdiction over domestic rail transport. Carmack thus requires the receiving rail carrier--but not the delivering or connecting rail carrier--to issue a bill of lading. As explained below, ascertaining the shipment's point of origin is critical to deciding whether the shipment includes a receiving rail carrier.

The conclusion that  Carmack's bill of lading requirement only applies to the receiving rail carrier is dictated by the text and is consistent with this Court's precedent. See St. Louis, I. M. & S. R. Co. v. Starbird, 243 U.S. 592, 604, 37 S. Ct. 462, 61 L. Ed. 917 (1917) (explaining that Carmack “requires the receiving carrier to issue a through bill of lading”). A receiving rail carrier is the initial carrier, which “receives” the property for domestic rail transportation at the journey's point of origin. § 11706(a). If Carmack's bill of lading requirement did not refer to the initial carrier, but rather to any rail carrier that in the  colloquial sense “received” the property from another carrier, then every carrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill. This would be altogether contrary to Carmack's purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill of lading for damage caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.

This Court's decision in Mexican Light & Power Co. v. Texas Mexican R. Co., 331 U.S. 731, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779 (1947), supports the conclusion that only the receiving rail carrier must issue a Carmack bill of lading. There, a subsequent rail carrier in an export shipment from the United States to Mexico issued its own separate bill of lading at the U. S.-Mexico border. The  second bill differed from the through bill issued by the “initial carrier,” id., at 733, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779, (that is, the receiving carrier) at the inland point of origin. The Court held that Carmack, far from requiring nonreceiving carriers to issue their separate bills of lading, makes any subsequent bill “void” unless the “so-called second bill of lading represents the initiation of a new shipment.” Id., at 734, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779.

The Court's decision in Reider v. Thompson, 339 U.S. 113, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods originating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in the United States. The Court in Reider determined that because there was no through bill of lading, the original journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack bill of lading. Id., at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698. And because that carrier had to issue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage done during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. Id., at 118-119, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698. Notably, neitherMexican Light  nor Reider addressed the situation in the present cases, where the shipment originates overseas under a through bill of lading. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.

 The Carmack Amendment's second sentence establishes when Carmack liability applies:

“[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sentence] and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading.” § 11706(a)

Thus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject to liability only when damage is done to this “property,” that is to say, to property for which Carmack's first sentence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of lading. Ibid. Put another way, Carmack applies only to transport  of property for which Carmack requires a receiving carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether that carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See ibid. (“Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier”). The language in some of the Courts of Appeals' decisions, which were rejected by the Court of Appeals in the opinion now under review, could be read to imply that Carmack applies only if a rail carrier actually issued a separate domestic bill of lading. See, e.g.,Altadis, 458 F.3d, at 1291-1294; American Road, 348 F.3d  at 568; Shao, 986 F.2d, at 703; Capitol Converting, 965 F.2d, at 394. This may have led to some confusion. The decisive question is not whether the rail carrier in fact issued a Carmack bill but rather whether that carrier was required to issue a bill by Carmack's first sentence.

The above principles establish that  for Carmack's provisions to apply the journey must begin with a receiving rail carrier, which would have to issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading. It follows that Carmack does not apply if the property is received at an overseas location under a through bill that covers the transport into an inland location in the United States. In such a case, there is no receiving rail carrier that “receives” the property “for [domestic rail] transportation,” § 11706(a), and thus no carrier that must issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading. The initial carrier in that instance receives the property at the shipment's point of origin for overseas multimodal import transport, not for domestic rail transport. (Today's decision need not address the instance where goods are received at a point in the United States for export. Nor is it necessary to decide if Carmack applies to goods initially received in Canada or Mexico, for import into the United States. See infra, at 107, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441.)

The present cases illustrate the operation of these principles. Carmack did not require “K” Line to issue bills of lading because “K” Line was not a receiving rail carrier. “K” Line obtained the cargo in China for overseas transport  across an ocean and then to inland destinations in the United States. “K” Line shipped this property under COGSA-authorized through bills of lading. See supra, at 94-95, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 434-435. That “K” Line chose to use rail transport to complete one segment of the journey under these “essentially maritime” contracts, Kirby, 543 U.S., at 24, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283, does not put “K” Line within Carmack's reach and thus does not require it to issue Carmack bills of lading.

As for Union Pacific, it was also not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack. The cargo owners conceded at oral argument that, even under their theory, Union Pacific was a mere delivering carrier, which did not have to issue its own Carmack bill of lading. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 39. This was a necessary concession.  A carrier does not become a receiving carrier simply by accepting goods for further transport from another carrier in the middle of an international shipment under a through bill. After all, Union Pacific was not the “initial carrier” for the carriage. Mexican Light, 331 U.S., at 733, 67, S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779.

If a carrier like Union Pacific, which acts as a connecting or delivering carrier during an international through shipment, was, counterintuitively, a receiving carrier under Carmack, this would in effect outlaw through shipments under a single bill of lading. This is because a carriage like the one in the present case would require two bills of lading: one that the overseas carrier (here, “K” Line) issues to the cargo owners under COGSA, and a second one that the first domestic rail carrier (here, Union Pacific) issues to the overseas carrier under Carmack. Kirby noted “the popularity of 'through' bills of lading, in which cargo owners can contract for transportation across oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.” 543 U.S., at 25-26, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The  Court sees no reason to read COGSA and Carmack to outlaw this efficient mode of international shipping by requiring these journeys to have multiple bills of lading. In addition, if Union Pacific had to issue a Carmack bill of lading to “K”  Line, it is unclear whether the cargo owners (the parties Carmack is designed to protect) would be able to sue under the terms governing that bill, especially in light of their different through bill with “K” Line. These difficulties are reason enough to reject this novel interpretation of Carmack, which was neither urged by any party nor adopted by any authority that has been called to this Court's attention.

This would be a quite different case if, as in Reider, the bills of lading for the overseas transport ended at this country's ports and the cargo owners then contracted with Union Pacific to complete a new journey to an inland destination in the United States. Under those circumstances, Union Pacific would have been the receiving rail carrier and would have been required to issue a separate Carmack-compliant bill of lading to the cargo owners. See Reider, 339 U.S., at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (“If the various parties dealing with this shipment separated the carriage into distinct portions by their contracts, it is not for courts judicially to meld the portions into something they are not”).

The Court of Appeals interpreted Carmack as applying to any domestic rail segment of an overseas shipment, regardless of whether Carmack required a bill of lading. The court rested on the assumption that the “[STB]'s jurisdiction . . . is coextensive with Carmack's coverage.” 557 F.3d, at 992. Yet, as explained above,  Carmack applies only to shipments for which Carmack requires a bill of lading; that is to say, to shipments that start with a carrier that is both subject to the STB's jurisdiction and “receives [the property] for [domestic rail] transportation.” The Court of Appeals ignored this “receive[d] . . . for transportation” limitation and so reached the wrong conclusion. See, e.g.,Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979) (courts are “obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used?).

The Court of Appeals' conclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmack's venue provisions.  Under Carmack, a suit  against the “originating” (that is, receiving) rail carrier that has not actually caused the damage to the goods “may only be brought . . . in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located.” § 11706(d)(2)(A), (A)(i). Suit against either a delivering carrier or any carrier that caused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in various other districts. See § 11706(d)(2)(B), (C). “[J]udicial district” refers to “district court of the United States or in a State Court.” § 11706(d)(1). Carmack's venue provisions presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a judicial district within the United States. Here, the journey's “point of origin” was China, so Carmack's venue provisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does not apply to this carriage.

Indeed, if “K” Line were a receiving carrier in a case where the journey's “point of origin” was China, there would be no place under Carmack to sue “K” Line, since China is not within a judicial district “of the United States or in a State court.” Ibid. Carmack's original premise is that the receiving carrier is liable for damage caused by the other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise would be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue the receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different carrier under one of Carmack's other venue provisions and then naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The far more likely conclusion is that “K” Line is not a receiving rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack, including its venue provisions, does not apply to property shipped under “K” Line's through bills. True, if the sole question were one of venue, suit could still be brought against the carrier that caused the damage or the delivering carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for, as the Court holds, Carmackis inapplicable in these cases.

 B 

Carmack's statutory history supports the conclusion that it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas under a  through bill. None of Carmack's legislative versions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.

Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amendment's provisions applied only to “property for transportation from a point in one State to a point in another State.” § 7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, § 1, 38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained unchanged until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the pre-1978 language, Carmack's bill of lading provisions applied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also to cargo “receive[d] . . . for transportation” “from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country.” 49 U.S.C. § 20(11) (1976 ed.).

Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada and Mexico because the phrase “from . . . to” could also mean “between,” cf. Reider, supra, at 118, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (explicitly not deciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority holding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied to cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries under a through bill. See, e.g., In re The Cummins Amendment,33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respondents 8 (effectively conceding this point).

In 1978, Congress adopted the Carmack Amendment in largely its current form. § 1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in the statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack and instructed that this recodification “may not be construed as making a substantive change in the la[w].” § 3(a), id., at 1466; see Burlington Northern R.  Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 481 U.S. 454, 457, n. 1, 107 S. Ct. 1855, 95 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1987). By interpreting the current version of the Carmack Amendment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of Appeals disregarded this direction and dramatically expanded Carmack's scope beyond its historical coverage.

 Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that reenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive change that the Court of Appeals' decision would entail. See § 102(a), 109 Stat. 847-849. There is no claim that the 1995 statute altered Carmack's text in any manner relevant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsections of Carmack for readability. Cf. United States v. O'Brien, 560 U.S. 218, 233-234, 130 S. Ct. 2169, 176 L. Ed. 2d 979, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 4167, *27 (2010)) (“[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines . . . advise drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate subsections that can be read more easily”).

 C 

 Where the text permits, congressional enactments should be construed to be consistent with one another. And the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts attains the most consistency between Carmack and COGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment of an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill would undermine Carmack's purposes. Carmack is premised on the view that the shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage during the journey is the responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering carrier. See supra, at 98, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 435. Yet, under the Court of Appeals' interpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue in which to sue the receiving carrier. See supra, at 106, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 440.

Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same through shipment would undermine COGSA and international, container-based multimodal transport. As Kirby explained, "[t]he international transportation industry 'clearly has moved into a new era--the age of multimodalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all available modes of transportation by air, water, and land.' 543 U.S., at 25, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack applied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas under a through bill, then one set of liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is damaged  at sea (COGSA) and another almost always would apply when the damage occurs on land (Carmack). Rather than making claims by cargo owners easier to resolve, a court would have to decide where the damage occurred to determine which law applied. As a practical matter, this requirement often could not be met; for damage to the content of containers can occur when the contents are damaged by rough handling, seepage, or theft, at some unknown point. See H. Kindred & M. Brooks, Multimodal Transport Rules 143 (1997). Indeed, adopting the Court of Appeals' approach would seem to require rail carriers to open containers at the port to check if damage has been done during the sea voyage. This disruption would undermine international container-based transport. The Court will not read Congress' nonsubstantive recodification of Carmack in 1978 to create such a drastic sea change in practice in this area.

Applying Carmack's provisions to international import shipping transport would also undermine the “purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea.” Kirby, supra, at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. These cases provide an apt illustration. The sophisticated cargo owners here agreed to maritime bills of lading that applied to the inland segment through the Himalaya Clause and authorized “K” Line to subcontract for that inland segment “on any terms whatsoever.” The cargo owners thus made the decision to select “K” Line as a single company for their through transportation needs, rather than contracting for rail services themselves. The through bills provided the liability and venue rules for the foreseeable event that the cargo was damaged during carriage. Indeed, the cargo owners obtained separate insurance to protect against any excess loss. The forum-selection clause the parties agreed upon is “an indispensable element in international trade, commerce, and contracting” because it allows parties to “agre[e] in advance on a forum acceptable” to them. The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 13-14, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1972).  A clause of this  kind is enforced unless it imposes a venue “so gravely difficult and inconvenient that [the plaintiff] will for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court.” Id., at 18, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513. The parties sensibly agreed that because their bills were governed by Japanese law, Tokyo would be the best venue for any suit relating to the cargo.

The cargo owners' contrary policy arguments are unavailing. They assert that if Carmack does not apply, the inland segment of international shipments will be “unregulated.” Brief for Respondents 2, 21, 24, 64, 91. First, any speculation that not applying Carmack to inland segments of overseas shipments will cause severe problems is refuted by that fact that Carmack even arguably did not govern the inland portion of such shipments from its enactment in 1906 until its nonsubstantive recodification in 1978. See supra, at 107, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441-442. It is true that if the cargo owners' position were to prevail, the terms of through bills of lading made in maritime commerce would be more restricted in some circumstances. But that does not mean that the Court's holding leaves the field unregulated.  Ocean-based through bills are governed by COGSA, and ocean vessels like those operated by “K” Line are overseen by the Federal Maritime Commission. Supra, at 96, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 434-435. Rail carriers like Union Pacific, furthermore, remain subject to the STB's regulation to the extent they operate within the United States. See supra, at 105, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-440. It is notable that although the STB has jurisdiction to regulate the rates of such carriers, even when the carriage is not governed by the Carmack Amendment, the STB has exercised its authority to exempt from certain regulations service provided by a rail carrier “as part of a continuous intermodal freight movement,” 49 CFR § 1090.2 (2009), like the journey at issue in these cases, see ibid. (exercising the STB's deregulation authority under 49 U.S.C. § 10502(f)).

Finally, the cargo owners miss the mark in relying on the recent United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,  which has yet to be “ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11. These so-called “Rotterdam Rules” would explicitly allow the inland leg of an international shipment to be governed by a different legal regime than the ocean leg, under some circumstances. See G. A. Res. 63/122, art. 26, U. N. Doc. A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008). Nothing in the Rotterdam Rules, however, requires every country to mandate a different regime to govern the inland rail leg of an international through shipment; and, as explained above, Congress, by enacting COGSA, has opted for allowing shipments governed by a single through bill. And if the objection is that today's decision will undermine the results of these international negotiations in some way, that concern is met by the fact that the United States Government has urged the result the Court adopts today. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-29.

Congress has decided to allow parties engaged in international maritime commerce to structure their contracts, to a large extent, as they see fit. It has not imposed Carmack's regime, textually and historically limited to the carriage of goods received for domestic rail transport, onto what are “essentially maritime” contracts. Kirby, 543 U.S., at 24, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.

 V 

“K” Line received the goods in China, under through bills for shipment into the United States. “K” Line was thus not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack and was not required to issue bills of lading under that Amendment. Union Pacific is also not a receiving carrier for this carriage and was thus not required to issue Carmack-compliant bills. Because the journey included no receiving rail carrier that had to issue bills of lading under Carmack, Carmack does not apply. The parties' agreement to litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding. The cargo owners must abide by the contracts they made.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.

We consider whether, under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA or Act), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, a district court may decide a claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable, where the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the arbitrator.

I 

On February 1, 2007, the respondent here, Antonio Jackson, filed an employment-discrimination suit under Rev. Stat. § 1977, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, against his former employer in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The defendant and petitioner here, Rent-A-Center, West, Inc., filed a motion under the FAA to dismiss or stay the proceedings, 9 U.S.C. § 3, and to compel arbitration, § 4. Rent-A-Center argued that the Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate Claims (Agreement), which Jackson signed on February 24, 2003, as a condition of his employment there, precluded Jackson from pursuing his claims in court. The Agreement provided for arbitration of all “past, present or future” disputes arising out of Jackson's employment with Rent-A-Center, including “claims for discrimination” and  “claims for violation of any federal . . . law.” App. 29-30. It also provided that “[t]he Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.” Id., at 34.

Jackson opposed the motion on the ground that “the arbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable in that it is unconscionable” under Nevada law. Id., at 40. Rent-A-Center responded that Jackson's unconscionability claim was not properly before the court because Jackson had expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforceability of the Agreement. It also disputed the merits of Jackson's unconscionability claims.

The District Court granted Rent-A-Center's motion to dismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration. The court found that the Agreement “ ' “clearly and unmistakenly [sic]” ' ” gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement is enforceable, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. (quoting Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002)), and, because Jackson challenged the validity of the Agreement as a whole, the issue was for the arbitrator, App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a (citing Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 444-445, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006)). The court noted that even if it were to examine the merits of Jackson's unconscionability claims, it would have rejected the claim that the agreement to split arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable under Nevada law. It did not address Jackson's procedural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.

Without oral argument, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded. 581 F.3d 912 (2009). The court reversed on the question of who (the court or arbitrator) had  the authority to decide whether the Agreement is enforceable. It noted that “Jackson does not dispute that the language of the Agreement clearly assigns the arbitrability determination to the arbitrator,” but held that where “a party challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable, and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to the agreement, the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court.” Id., at 917. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's alternative conclusion that the fee-sharing provision was not substantively unconscionable and remanded for consideration of Jackson's other unconscionability arguments. Id., at 919-921, and n. 3. Judge Hall dissented on the ground that “the question of the arbitration agreement's validity should have gone to the arbitrator, as the parties 'clearly and unmistakably provide[d]' in their agreement.” Id., at 921.

We granted certiorari, 558 U.S. 1142, 130 S. Ct. 1133, 175 L. Ed. 2d 941 (2010).

II 

A 

 The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract. Section 2, the “primary substantive provision of the Act,” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 24, 103 S. Ct. 927, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1983), provides:

“A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.S.C. § 2.

 The FAA thereby places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye, supra, at 443, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038, and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland  Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 478, 109 S. Ct. 1248, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1989). Like other contracts, however, they may be invalidated by “generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.” Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S. Ct. 1652, 134 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1996).

 The Act also establishes procedures by which federal courts implement § 2's substantive rule. Under § 3, a party may apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an action “upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration.” Under § 4, a party “aggrieved” by the failure of another party “to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration” may petition a federal court “for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.” The court “shall” order arbitration “upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.” Ibid.

The Agreement here contains multiple “written provision[s]” to “settle by arbitration a controversy,” § 2. Two are relevant to our discussion. First, the section titled “Claims Covered By The Agreement” provides for arbitration of all “past, present or future” disputes arising out of Jackson's employment with Rent-A-Center. App. 29. Second, the section titled “Arbitration Procedures” provides that “[t]he Arbitrator . . . shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.” Id., at 32, 34. The current “controversy” between the parties is whether the Agreement is unconscionable. It is the second provision, which delegates resolution of that controversy to the arbitrator, that Rent-A-Center seeks to enforce. Adopting the terminology used by the parties, we will refer to it as the delegation provision.

The delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement. We have recognized that  parties can agree to arbitrate “gateway”  questions of “arbitrability,” such as whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular controversy. See, e.g., Howsam, 537 U.S., at 83-85, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491; Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 452, 123 S. Ct. 2402, 156 L. Ed. 2d 414 (2003) (plurality opinion). This line of cases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.1There is one caveat. First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995), held that  “[c]ourts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is 'clea[r] and unmistakabl[e]' evidence that they did so.” The parties agree the heightened standard applies here. See Brief for Petitioner 21; Brief for Respondent 54. The District Court concluded the “Agreement to Arbitrate clearly and unmistakenly [sic] provides the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to decide whether the Agreement to Arbitrate is enforceable.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a. The Ninth Circuit noted that Jackson did not dispute that the text of the Agreement was clear and unmistakable on this point. 581 F.3d 912, 917 (2009). He also does not dispute it here. What he argues now, however, is that it is not “clear and unmistakable” that his agreement to that text was valid, because of the unconscionability claims he raises. See Brief for Respondent 54-55. The dissent makes the same argument. See post, at 80-82, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 418-419 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  This mistakes the subject of the First Options “clear and unmistakable” requirement. It pertains to the parties' manifestation of intent, not the agreement's validity. As explained in Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002), it is an “interpretive rule,” based on an assumption about the parties' expectations. In “circumstance[s] where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter,” ibid., we assume that is what they agreed to. Thus, “[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.” AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 649, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648 (1986).The validity of a written agreement to arbitrate (whether it is legally binding, as opposed to whether it was in fact agreed to--including, of course, whether it was void for unconscionability) is governed by § 2's provision that it shall be valid “save upon such grounds as exist at law or equity for the revocation of any contract.” Those grounds do not include, of course, any requirement that its lack of unconscionability must be “clear and unmistakable.” And they are not grounds thatFirst Options added for agreements to arbitrate gateway issues; § 2 applies to all written agreements to arbitrate. See First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985 (1995).  An agreement to arbitrate a gateway issue is simply an additional, antecedent agreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal court to enforce, and the FAA operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other. The additional agreement is valid under § 2 “save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,” and federal courts can enforce the agreement by staying federal litigation under § 3 and compelling arbitration under § 4. The question before us, then, is whether the delegation provision is valid under § 2.

B 

 There are two types of validity challenges under § 2: “One type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,” and “[t]he other challenges the contract as a whole, either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement (e.g., the agreement was fraudulently induced), or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract's provisions renders the whole contract invalid.” Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 444, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038. In a line of cases neither party has asked us to overrule, we held that only the first type of challenge is relevant to a court's determination whether the arbitration agreement at issue is enforceable.2 The issue of the agreement's “validity” is different from the issue whether any agreement between the parties “was ever concluded,” and, as in Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006), we address only the former. Id., at 444, n. 1, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038. See Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 403-404, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967); Buckeye, supra, at 444-446, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038; Preston v. Ferrer, 552 U.S. 346, 353-354, 128 S. Ct. 978, 169 L. Ed. 2d 917 (2008). That is because § 2 states that a “written provision” “to settle by arbitration a controversy” is “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable” without mention of the validity of the contract in which it is contained. Thus, a party's challenge to another provision of the contract, or to the contract as a whole, does not prevent a court from enforcing a specific agreement to arbitrate. “[A]s a matter of substantive federal  arbitration law, an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.” Buckeye, 546 U.S., at 445, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038; see also id., at 447, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (the severability rule is based on § 2).

But  that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not mean that they are unassailable. If a party challenges the validity under § 2 of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue, the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under § 4. In Prima Paint, for example, if the claim had been “fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,” then the court would have considered it. 388 U.S., at 403-404, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270. “To immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would be to elevate it over other forms of contract,” id., at 404, n. 12, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270. In some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the contract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the same basis as applied only to the severable agreement to arbitrate. Thus, in an employment contract many elements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the entire contract (outrageously low wages, for example) would not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone. But even where that is not the case--as in Prima Paint itself, where the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract equally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part of that contract--we nonetheless require the basis of challenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to arbitrate before the court will intervene.

Here, the “written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy,” 9 U.S.C. § 2, that Rent-A-Center asks us to enforce is the delegation provision--the provision that gave the arbitrator “exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the . . . enforceability . . . of this Agreement,” App. 34. The “remainder of the contract,” Buckeye, supra, at 445, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038, is the rest of the agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of Jackson's employment with Rent-A-Center. To be sure this case differs from Prima Paint, Buckeye, and Preston,  in that the arbitration provisions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained in contracts unrelated to arbitration--contracts for consulting services, see Prima Paint, supra, at 397, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270, check-cashing services, see Buckeye, supra, at 442, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038, and “personal management” or “talent agent” services, see Preston, supra, at 352, 128 S. Ct. 978, 169 L. Ed. 2d 917. In this case, the underlying contract is itself an arbitration agreement. But that makes no difference.3The dissent calls this a “breezy assertion,” post, at 77, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 416, but it seems to us self-evident. When the dissent comes to discussing the point, post, at 85, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 421, it gives no logical reason why an agreement to arbitrate one controversy (an employment-discrimination claim) is not severable from an agreement to arbitrate a different controversy (enforceability). There is none. Since the dissent accepts that the invalidity of one provision within an arbitration agreement does not necessarily invalidate its other provisions, post, at 81-82, n. 7, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 419, it cannot believe in some sort of magic bond between arbitration provisions that prevents them from being severed from each other. According to the dissent, it is fine to sever an invalid provision within an arbitration agreement when severability is a matter of state law, but severability is not allowed when it comes to applying Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270 (1967). Application of the severability rule does not depend on the substance of the remainder of the contract. Section 2 operates on the specific “written provision” to “settle by arbitration a controversy” that the party seeks to enforce. Accordingly, unless Jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically, we must treat it as valid under § 2, and must enforce it under §§ 3 and 4, leaving any challenge to the validity of the Agreement as a whole for the arbitrator.

C 

The District Court correctly concluded that Jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole. Nowhere in his opposition to Rent-A-Center's motion to compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation provision. See App. 39-47. Rent-A-Center noted this fact in its reply: “ [Jackson's response] fails to rebut or otherwise address in any way [Rent-A-Center's] argument that the Arbitrator must decide [Jackson's] challenge to the enforceability of the Agreement. Thus, [Rent-A-Center's] argument is uncontested.” Id., at 50 (emphasis in original).

The arguments Jackson made in his response to Rent-A-Center's motion to compel arbitration support this conclusion. Jackson stated that “the entire agreementseems drawn to provide [Rent-A-Center] with undue advantages should an employment-related dispute arise.” Id., at 44 (emphasis added). At one point, he argued that the limitations on discovery “further suppor[t] [his] contention that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And before this Court, Jackson describes his challenge in the District Court as follows: He “opposed the motion to compel on the ground that the entire arbitration agreement, including the delegation clause, was unconscionable.” Brief for Respondent 55 (emphasis added). That is an accurate description of his filings.

As required to make out a claim of unconscionability under Nevada law, see 581 F.3d at 919, he contended that the Agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable. It was procedurally unconscionable, he argued, because it “was imposed as a condition of employment and was non-negotiable.” App. 41. But we need not consider that claim because none of Jackson's substantive unconscionability challenges was specific to the delegation provision. First, he argued that the Agreement's coverage was one sided in that it required arbitration of claims an employee was likely to bring--contract, tort, discrimination, and statutory claims--but did not require arbitration of claims Rent-A-Center was likely to bring--intellectual property, unfair competition, and trade secrets claims. Id., at 42-43. This one-sided-coverage argument clearly did not go to the validity of the delegation provision.

 Jackson's other two substantive unconscionability arguments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the contract--the fee-splitting arrangement and the limitations on discovery--procedures that were to be used during arbitration under both the agreement to arbitrate employment-related disputes and the delegation provision. It may be that had Jackson challenged the delegation provision by arguing that these common procedures as applied to the delegation provision rendered that provision unconscionable, the challenge should have been considered by the court. To make such a claim based on the discovery procedures, Jackson would have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes the arbitration of his claim that the Agreement is unenforceable to be unconscionable. That would be, of course, a much more difficult argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders arbitration of his factbound employment-discrimination claim unconscionable. Likewise, the unfairness of the fee-splitting arrangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbitration of enforceability than for arbitration of more complex and fact-related aspects of the alleged employment discrimination. Jackson, however, did not make any arguments specific to the delegation provision; he argued that the fee-sharing and discovery procedures rendered the entire Agreement invalid.

Jackson's appeal to the Ninth Circuit confirms that he did not contest the validity of the delegation provision in particular. His brief noted the existence of the delegation provision, Brief for Appellant in No. 07-16164, p. 3, but his unconscionability arguments made no mention of it, id., at 3-7. He also repeated the arguments he had made before the District Court, see supra, at 73, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 413, that the “entire agreement” favors Rent-A-Center and that the limitations on discovery further his “contention that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,” Brief for Appellant 7-8.  Finally, he repeated the argument made in his District Court filings, that under state law the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from the arbitration agreement, see id., at 8-9.4Jackson's argument fails.  The severability rule is a “matter of substantive federal arbitration law,” and we have repeatedly “rejected the view that the question of 'severability' was one of state law, so that if state law held the arbitration provision not to be severable a challenge to the contract as a whole would be decided by the court.” Buckeye,546 U.S., at 445, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (citing Prima Paint, 388 U.S., at 400, 402-403, 87 S. Ct. 1801, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1270; Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 10-14, 104 S. Ct. 852, 79 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1984); Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.S. 265, 270-273, 115 S. Ct. 834, 130 L. Ed. 2d 753 (1995)). For the same reason, the Agreement's statement that its provisions are severable, see App. 37, does not affect our analysis. The point of this argument, of course, is that the Agreement as a whole is unconscionable under state law.

Jackson repeated that argument before this Court. At oral argument, counsel stated: “There are certain elements of the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and, under Nevada law, which would render the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 43 (emphasis added). And again, he stated, “we've got both certain provisions that are unconscionable, that under Nevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable . . . , and that's what the Court is to rely on.” Id., at 43-44 (emphasis added).

In his brief to this Court, Jackson made the contention, not mentioned below, that the delegation provision itself is substantively unconscionable because the quid pro quo he was supposed to receive for it--that “in exchange for initially allowing an arbitrator to decide certain gateway questions,” he would receive “plenary post-arbitration judicial review”--was eliminated by the Court's subsequent holding in Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008), that the nonplenary grounds for judicial review in § 10 of the FAA are exclusive. Brief for Respondent 59-60. He brought this challenge to the delegation provision too late,  and we will not consider it.5Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008), was decided after Jackson submitted his brief to the Ninth Circuit, but that does not change our conclusion that he forfeited the argument. Jackson could have submitted a supplemental brief during the year and a half between this Court's decision of Hall Street on March 25, 2008, and the Ninth Circuit's judgment on September 9, 2009. Moreover, Hall Street affirmed a rule that had been in place in the Ninth Circuit since 2003. Id., at 583-584, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254. See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U.S. 247, 273–274, 556 U.S. 247, 129 S. Ct. 1456, 173 L. Ed. 2d 398, 419-20 (2009).

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

It is so ordered.


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts II-B-2 and II-C-2.1Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts II-B-2 and II-C-2. Justice Scalia does not join Parts II-B-2 and II-C-2.

The question in this case turns on whether a patent can be issued for a claimed invention designed for the business  world. The patent application claims a procedure for instructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the risk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the economy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition that the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent law: (1) It is not tied to a machine and does not transform an article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business; and (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals ruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called machine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used for determining the patentability of a “process” under the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. § 101.

 I 

Petitioners' application seeks patent protection for a claimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of commodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key claims are claims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula. Claim 1 consists of the following steps:

“(a) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumers;“(b) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and“(c) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of  said series of consumer transactions.” App. 19-20.

The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims “[t]he method of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and said market participants are transmission distributors.” Id., at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar statistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in claim 4's equation. For example, claim 7 advises using well-known random analysis techniques to determine how much a seller will gain “from each transaction under each historical weather pattern.” Id., at 21.

The patent examiner rejected petitioners' application, explaining that it “ 'is not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely  mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application, therefore, the invention is not directed to the technological arts.' ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a. The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed, concluding that the application involved only mental steps that do not transform physical matter and was directed to an abstract idea. Id., at 181a-186a.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case produced five different opinions. Students of patent law would be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.

Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable “process” under § 101 --whether it produces a “ 'useful, concrete, and tangible result' ”--as articulated in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d 1368, 1373 (1998), and AT&T Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., 172 F.3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943, 959-960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc). The court held that “[a] claimed process is surely patent-eligible under § 101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.” Id., at 954. The court concluded this “machine-or-transformation test” is “the sole test governing § 101 analyses,” id., at 955, and thus the “test for determining patent eligibility of a process under § 101,” id., at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test, the court held that petitioners' application was not patent eligible. Id., at 963-966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate concurring opinion, providing historical support for the court's approach. Id., at 966-976.

Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer argued that petitioners' application was “not eligible for patent protection because it is directed to a method of conducting business.” Id., at 998. He urged the adoption of a “technological standard for patentability.” Id., at 1010. Judge  Rader would have found petitioners' claims were an unpatentable abstract idea. Id., at 1011. Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court's conclusion that petitioners' application was outside of the reach of § 101. She did not say that the application should have been granted but only that the issue should be remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the application qualified as patentable under other provisions. Id., at 997.

This Court granted certiorari. 556 U.S. 303, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443 (2009).

A 

Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be patented under the Patent Act:

“Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.”

Section 101 thus specifies four independent categories of inventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. “In choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by the comprehensive 'any,' Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.” Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980). Congress took this permissive approach to patent eligibility to ensure that “ 'ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement.' Id., at 308-309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (quoting 5 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 75-76 (H. Washington ed. 1871)).

 The Court's precedents provide three specific exceptions to § 101's broad patent- eligibility principles: “laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.” Chakrabarty, supra, at 309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144. While these exceptions are not required by the statutory text, they are consistent with the notion that a patentable process must be “new and useful.” And, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach of the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years. See Le Roy v. Tatham, 55 U.S. 156, 14 How. 156, 174-175, 14 L. Ed. 367 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are “part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.” Funk Brothers Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co., 333 U.S. 127, 130, 68 S. Ct. 440, 92 L. Ed. 588, 1948 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 671 (1948).

The § 101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive the Patent Act's protection the claimed invention must also satisfy “the conditions and requirements of this title.” § 101. Those requirements include that the invention be novel, see § 102, nonobvious, see § 103, and fully and particularly described, see § 112.

The present case involves an invention that is claimed to be a “process” under § 101. Section 100(b) defines “process” as:

“process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.”

The Court first considers two proposed categorical limitations on “process” patents under § 101 that would, if adopted, bar petitioners' application in the present case: the machine-or-transformation test and the categorical exclusion of business method patents.

B

1 

Under the Court of Appeals' formulation, an invention is a “process” only if: “(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.” 545 F.3d at, 954. This Court has “more than once cautioned that  courts 'should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed.' Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 182,101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1981) (quoting Chakrabarty, supra, at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144; some internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as in all statutory construction, “[u]nless otherwise defined, 'words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.' Diehr, supra, at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S. Ct. 311, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1979)).  The Court has read the § 101 term “manufacture” in accordance with dictionary definitions, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (citing American Fruit Growers, Inc. v. Brogdex Co., 283 U.S. 1, 11, 51 S. Ct. 328, 75 L. Ed. 801, 1931 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 711 (1931)), and approved a construction of the term “composition of matter” consistent with common usage, see Chakrabarty, supra, at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144(citing Shell Development Co. v. Watson, 149 F. Supp. 279, 280, 1958 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 94 (DC 1957)).

Any suggestion in this Court's case law that the Patent Act's terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only been an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584, 588-589, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1978). This Court has not indicated that the existence of these well-established exceptions gives the Judiciary carte blanche to impose other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and the statute's purpose and design. Concerns about attempts to call any form of human activity a “process” can be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements of § 101.

Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test for what constitutes a “process” (as opposed to just an important and useful clue) violates these statutory interpretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that “[t]he term 'process' means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.” The Court is unaware of any “ 'ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,' Diehr, supra, at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, of the definitional terms “process, art or method” that would require these terms to be tied to a machine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the Court to look to the other patentable categories in § 101 --machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter--to confine the meaning of “process” to a machine or transformation, under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis. Under this canon, “an ambiguous term may be given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.” United States v. Stevens, 559 U.S. ___, ___, 559 U.S. 460, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435, 447 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). This canon is inapplicable  here, for § 100(b) already explicitly defines the term “process.” See Burgess v. United States, 553 U.S. 124, 130, 128 S. Ct. 1572, 170 L. Ed. 2d 478 (2008) (“When a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test. It is true that Cochrane v. Deener,94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 L. Ed. 139, 1877 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 242 (1877), explained that a “process” is “an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.” More recent cases, however, have rejected the broad implications of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority shows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive test. Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63, 70, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1972), noted that “[t]ransformation and reduction of an article 'to a different state or thing' is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.” At the same time, it explicitly declined to “hold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet [machine-or-transformation] requirements.” Id., at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. Flook took a similar approach, “assum[ing] that a valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet [the machine-or-transformation test].” 437 U.S., at 588, n. 9, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451.

 This Court's precedents establish that the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under § 101. The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible “process.”

 2 

It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in earlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained by Judge Dyk's thoughtful historical review. See 545 F.3d at, 966-976 (concurring opinion). But times change. Technology and other innovations progress in unexpected ways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that until recent times, “well-established principles of patent law probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid patent on almost any conceivable computer program.” Diehr, 450 U.S., at 195, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (Stevens, J., dissenting). But this fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such as computer programs are always unpatentable. See id., at 192-193, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for molding rubber that included a computer program is within patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a “dynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions.” J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int'l, Inc., 534 U.S. 124, 135, 122 S. Ct. 593, 151 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2001). A categorical rule denying patent protection for “inventions in areas not contemplated by Congress . . . would frustrate the purposes of the patent law.” Chakrabarty, 447 U.S., at 315, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144.

The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a sufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in the Industrial Age--for example, inventions grounded in a physical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to doubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for determining the patentability of inventions in the Information Age. As numerous amicus briefs argue, the machine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as to the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medicine techniques, and inventions based on linear programming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital signals. See, e.g.,  Brief for Business Software Alliance 24-25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al. 14-27; Brief for  Boston Patent Law Association 8-15; Brief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association 17-22; Brief for Dolby Laboratories, Inc., et al. 9-10.

In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation test to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions of such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring the larger object of securing patents for valuable inventions without transgressing the public domain. The dissent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties. 545 F.3d at, 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable “process[es],” it may not make sense to require courts to confine themselves to asking the questions posed by the machine-or-transformation test. Section 101's terms suggest that new technologies may call for new inquiries. See Benson, supra, at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (to “freeze process patents to old technologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing technology[,] . . . is not our purpose”).

 It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not commenting on the patentability of any particular invention, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned technologies from the Information Age should or should not receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibility of innovation in the hands of more people and raises new difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in striking the balance between protecting inventors and not granting monopolies over procedures that others would discover by independent, creative application of general principles. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take a position on where that balance ought to be struck.

Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention that the term “process” categorically excludes business methods.  The term “method,” which is within § 100(b)'s definition of “process,” at least as a textual matter and before consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and this Court's precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business. See, e.g., Webster's New International Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining “method” as “[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or manner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure adopted in investigation or instruction”). The Court is unaware of any argument that the “ 'ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,' Diehr, supra, at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, of “method” excludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a prohibition on business method patents would reach, and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently. See, e.g., Hall, Business and Financial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56 Scottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (“There is no precise definition of . . . business method patents”).

The argument that business methods are categorically outside of § 101's scope is further undermined by the fact that  federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents. Under 35 U.S.C. § 273(b)(1), if a patent-holder claims infringement based on “a method in [a] patent,” the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone, “method” is defined as “a method of doing or conducting business.” § 273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this defense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents. Section 273's definition of “method,” to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a prior-enacted statute. But what § 273 does is clarify the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of “method” that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under § 101.

A conclusion that business methods are not patentable in any circumstances would render § 273 meaningless. This would violate  the canon against interpreting any statutory  provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous. See Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. ___, ___, 556 U.S. 303, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443, 462 (2009). This principle, of course, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the U. S.Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at different times. See, e.g., Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, 307 U.S. 496, 529-530, 59 S. Ct. 954, 83 L. Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpretation cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of various legislators in enacting the subsequent provision. Finally, while § 273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patentability of such claimed inventions.

2 

Interpreting § 101 to exclude all business methods simply because business method patents were rarely issued until modern times revives many of the previously discussed difficulties. See supra, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803-804. At the same time, some business method patents raise special problems in terms of vagueness and suspect validity. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C.,547 U.S. 388, 397, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Information Age empowers people with new capacities to perform statistical analyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and sophistication that enable the design of protocols for more efficient performance of a vast number of business tasks. If a high enough bar is not set when considering patent applications of this sort, patent examiners and courts could  be flooded with claims that would put a chill on creative endeavor and dynamic change.

In searching for a limiting principle, this Court's precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide useful tools. See infra, at ___ - ___, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 805-807. Indeed, if the Court of Appeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category or class of patent applications that claim to instruct how business should be conducted, and then rule that the category is unpatentable because, for instance, it represents an attempt to  patent abstract ideas, this conclusion might well be in accord with controlling precedent. See ibid. But beyond this or some other limitation consistent with the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the possibility that there are at least some processes that can be fairly described as business methods that are within patentable subject matter under § 101.

Finally, even if a particular business method fits into the statutory definition of a “process,” that does not mean that the application claiming that method should be granted. In order to receive patent protection, any claimed invention must be novel, § 102, nonobvious, § 103, and fully and particularly described, § 112. These limitations serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever present in patent law, between stimulating innovation by protecting inventors and impeding progress by granting patents when not justified by the statutory design.

III 

Even though petitioners' application is not categorically outside of § 101 under the two broad and atextual approaches the Court rejects today, that does not mean it is a “process” under § 101. Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets. App. 19-20. Rather than adopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case narrowly on the basis of this Court's decisions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr, which show that petitioners' claims are not patentable processes because they are attempts to patent abstract ideas. Indeed, all Members of the Court agree that the patent application at issue here falls outside of § 101 because it claims an abstract idea.

In Benson, the Court considered whether a patent application for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary code was a “process” under § 101. 409 U.S., at 64-67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. The Court first explained that “ '[a] principle,  in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.' Id., at 67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (quoting Le Roy, 55 U.S. 156, 14 How., at 175, 14 L. Ed. 367). The Court then held the application at issue was not a “process,” but an unpatentable abstract idea. “It is conceded that  one may not patent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the result if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure binary numerals were patented in this case.” 409 U.S., at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. A contrary holding “would wholly preempt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.” Id., at 72, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273.

In Flook, the Court considered the next logical step after Benson. The applicant there attempted to patent a procedure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic conversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining industries. The application's only innovation was reliance on a mathematical algorithm. 437 U.S., at 585-586, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. Flook held the invention was not a patentable “process.” The Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the algorithm in Benson, had been limited so that it could still be freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining industries. 437 U.S., at 589-590, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. Nevertheless, Flook rejected “[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.” Id., at 590, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. The Court concluded that the process at issue there was “unpatentable under § 101, not because it contain[ed] a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contain[ed] no patentable invention.” Id., at 594, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. As the Court later explained, Flook stands for the proposition that  the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas “cannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment”  or adding “insignificant postsolution activity.” Diehr, 450 U.S., at 191-192, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155.

Finally, in Diehr, the Court established a limitation on the principles articulated in Benson and Flook. The application in Diehr claimed a previously unknown method for “molding raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products,” using a mathematical  formula to complete some of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U.S., at 177, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. Diehr explained that  while an abstract idea, law of nature, or mathematical formula could not be patented, “an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection.” Id., at 187, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. Diehr emphasized the need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than “dissect[ing] the claims into old and new elements and then . . . ignor[ing] the presence of the old elements in the analysis.” Id., at 188, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. Finally, the Court concluded that because the claim was not “an attempt to patent a mathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial process for the molding of rubber products,” it fell within § 101's patentable subject matter. Id., at 192-193, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155.

In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners' application is not a patentable “process.” Claims 1 and 4 in petitioners' application explain the basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk: “Hedging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.” 545 F.3d at, 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, e.g.,  D. Chorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instruments 75-94 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, & J. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses 581-582 (13th ed. 2010); S. Ross, R. Westerfield, & B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Corporate Finance 743-744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of hedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathematical formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in Benson and Flook. Allowing  petitioners to patent risk hedging would preempt use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.

Petitioners' remaining claims are broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets. Flook established that  limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the remaining claims in petitioners' application do. These claims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of hedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed, these claims add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention in Flook did, for the Flook invention was at least directed to the narrower domain of signaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.

* * * 

Today, the Court once again declines to impose limitations on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act's text. The patent application here can be rejected under our precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas. The Court, therefore, need not define further what constitutes a patentable “process,” beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in § 100(b) and looking to the guideposts inBenson,Flook, andDiehr.

And nothing in today's opinion should be read as endorsing interpretations of § 101 that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State Street, 149 F.3d at, 1373; AT&T Corp., 172 F.3d at, 1357. It may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents, including (but not limited to) application of our opinions in Benson, Flook, and Diehr. In disapproving an exclusive machine-or-transformation  test, we by no means foreclose the Federal Circuit's development of other limiting criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act and are not inconsistent with its text.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.


Justice Alito announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, II-B, II-D, and III, in which TheChief Justice, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join, and an opinion with respect to Parts II-C, IV, and V, in which TheChief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join.

Two years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008), we held that the Second Amendment protects the  right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense, and we struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home. The city of Chicago (Chicago or City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws that are similar to the District of Columbia's, but Chicago and Oak Park argue that their laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment has no application to the States. We have previously held that  most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to both the Federal Government and the States. Applying the standard that is well established in our case law, we hold that the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States.

I 

Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and David Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self-defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago's firearms laws. A City ordinance provides that “[n]o person shall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.” Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code § 8-20-040(a) (2009). The Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens who reside in the City. § 8-20-050(c). Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it “unlawful for any person to possess . . . any firearm,” a term that includes “pistols, revolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as handguns.” Oak Park, Ill., Village Code §§ 27-2-1 (2007), 27-1-1 (2009).

Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents “from the loss of property and injury or death from firearms.” See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago petitioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City's handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted1See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6-7 (noting that handgun murder rate per 100,000 persons was 9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008). and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable cities.2Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 8-9 (“In 2002 and again in 2008, Chicago had more murders than any other city in the U. S., including the much larger Los Angeles and New York” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Brief for International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 17-21, and App. A (providing comparisons of Chicago's rates of assault, murder, and robbery to average crime rates in 24 other large cities).

Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets of threats and violence. For instance, Otis McDonald, who is in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood. He is a community activist involved with alternative policing strategies, and his efforts to improve his neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from drug dealers. App. 16-17; Brief for State Firearm Associations as Amici Curiae 20-21; Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8. Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resident whose home has been targeted by burglars. “In Mrs. Lawson's judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago would decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or death should she ever be threatened again in her home.”3Brief for Women State Legislators et al. as Amici Curiae 2. McDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own handguns that they store outside of the city limits, but they would like to keep their handguns in their homes for protection. See App. 16-19, 43-44 (McDonald), 20-24 (C. Lawson), 19, 36 (Orlov), 20-21, 40 (D. Lawson).

 After our decision in Heller, the Chicago petitioners and two groups4TheIllinois State Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. filed suit against the City in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and several related Chicagoordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Courtby the National Rifle Association (NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA and others filed a third action challenging the Chicago ordinances. All three cases were assigned to the same District Judge.

The District Court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. See App. 83-84; NRA, Inc. v. Oak Park, 617 F. Supp. 2d 752, 754 (ND Ill. 2008). The court noted that the Seventh Circuit had “squarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban on handguns a quarter century ago,” id., at 753 (citing Quilici v. Morton Grove, 695 F.2d 261 (CA7 1982)), and that Heller had explicitly refrained from “opin[ing] on the subject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amendment,” NRA, 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 754. The court observed that a district judge has a “duty to follow established precedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is beholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw may point in a different direction.” Id., at 753.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century cases--United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588 (1876), Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252, 6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U.S. 535, 14 S. Ct. 874, 38 L. Ed. 812 (1894) --that were decided in the wake of this Court's interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the Slaughter-House Cases,83 U.S. 36, 16 Wall. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873). The Seventh Circuit described the rationale of those cases as “defunct” and recognized that they did not consider the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. NRA, Inc. v. Chicago, 567 F.3d 856, 857, 858 (2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that have “direct application,” and it declined to predict how the Second Amendment would fare under this Court's modern “selective incorporation” approach. Id., at 857-858 (internal quotation marks omitted).

We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 48, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).

II

A 

Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons. Petitioners' primary submission is that this right is among the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” and that the narrow interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause adopted in the Slaughter-House Cases, supra, should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause “incorporates” the Second Amendment right.

Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of any “ 'civilized' ” legal system. Brief for Municipal Respondents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents tell us, then that right is not protected by due process. Ibid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the municipal respondents maintain that due process does not preclude such measures. Id., at 21-23. In light of the parties' far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting this Court's analysis over the years of the relationship between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.

 B 

TheBill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government. In Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 32 U.S. 243, 7 Pet. 243, 8 L. Ed. 672 (1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, explained that this question was “of great importance” but “not of much difficulty.” Id., at 247, 7 Pet. 243, 8 L. Ed. 672. In less than four pages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the States, holding that they apply only to the Federal Government. See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore, 32 U.S. 469, 7 Pet. 469, 551-552, 8 L. Ed. 751 (1833) (“[I]t is now settled that those amendments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states”).

The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country's federal system. The provision at issue in this case,  § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other things, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”

Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the Amendment's reference to “the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” TheSlaughter-House Cases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law permitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans. Justice Samuel Miller's opinion for the Court concluded that  the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.” Id., at 79, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. The Court held that other fundamental rights--rights that predated the creation of the Federal Government and that “the State governments were created to establish and secure”--were not protected by the Clause. Id., at 76, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394.

 In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two principal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof . . . citizens of the United Statesand of the State wherein they reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV provides that  “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” (Emphasis added.)(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a contrary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people,” and the Court refused to conclude that such a change had been made “in the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. Finding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” lacking by this high standard, the Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something more limited.

 Under the Court's narrow reading, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects such things as the right

“to come to the seat of government to assert any claim [a citizen] may have upon that government, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection, to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State of the Union by a bona fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at 79-80, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (internal quotation marks omitted).

 Finding no constitutional protection against state intrusion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the Court upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Justice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing the Fourteenth Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause to “a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its passage.” Id., at 96, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394; see alsoid., at 104, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects rights that are “in their nature . . . fundamental,” including the right of every man to pursue his profession without the imposition of unequal or discriminatory restrictions. Id., at 96-97, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Bradley's dissent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implication . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the most important privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at 118, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated in the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights. Id., at 119, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Swayne described the majority's narrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as “turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id., at 129, 83 U.S. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (dissenting opinion).

Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of the narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g., Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment agree “that the Clause does not mean what the Court said it meant in 1873”); Amar, Substance and Method in the Year 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178  (2001) (“Virtually no serious modern scholar--left, right, and center--thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible reading of the Amendment”); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an “overwhelming consensus among leading constitutional  scholars” that the opinion is “egregiously wrong”); C. Black, A New Birth of Freedom 74-75 (1997).

Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three 19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied. 92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588. In that case, the Court reviewed convictions stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisiana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white men.6See C. Lane, The Day Freedom Died 265-266 (2008); see also Brief for NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 3, and n. 2. Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed African-American prisoners through the streets and then had them summarily executed.7See Lane, supra, at 106. Ninety-seven men were indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine went to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges; the remaining three were acquitted of murder but convicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of various constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms.8United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 544-545, 23 L. Ed. 588(statement of the case), 548, 553 (opinion of the Court) (1876); Lawrence, Civil Rights and Criminal Wrongs: The Mens Rea of Federal Civil Rights Crimes, 67 Tulane L. Rev. 2113, 2153 (1993).

The Court reversed all of the convictions, including those relating to the deprivation of the victims' right to bear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U.S., at 553, 559, 544-545, 23 L. Ed. 588. The Court wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose “is not a right granted by the Constitution” and is not “in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.” Id., at 553, 544-545, 23 L. Ed. 588. “Thesecond amendment,” the Court continued, “declares that it shall not be infringed; but this . . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.” Ibid. “Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,116 U.S. 252, 265, [6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615]  (1886), and Miller v. Texas,153 U.S. 535, 538, [14 S. Ct. 874, 38 L. Ed. 812] (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government.” Heller, 554 U.S., at 620, n. 23, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.

C 

As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners' claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue, however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In petitioners' view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15-21, but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause's full scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6, 8-11. Nor is there any consensus on that question among the scholars who agree that the Slaughter-House Cases' interpretation is flawed. See Saenz, supra, at 522, n. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (Thomas, J., dissenting).

We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here. For many decades, the question of the rights protected by theFourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-Householding.

At the same time, however, this Court's decisions in Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right binding on the States. See Heller, 554 U.S., at 620, n. 23, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. None of those cases “engage[d] in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below, Cruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in which the Court began the process of “selective incorporation” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never previously addressed the question whether the  right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under that theory.

Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding that other rights that were at issue in that case are binding on the States through the Due Process Clause. In Cruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against the Federal Government and not against the States. See 92 U.S., at 551-552, 23 L. Ed. 588. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fundamental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 364, 57 S. Ct. 255, 81 L. Ed. 278 (1937). We follow the same path here and thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.

1 

In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884) (due process does not require grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979 (1897) (due process prohibits States from taking of private property for public use without just compensation). Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era should be noted.

First, the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 99, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97 (1908).

Second, the Court explained that the only rights protected against state infringement by the Due Process Clause were those rights “of such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid. See also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (1947); Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (1937);Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U.S. 233, 56 S. Ct. 444, 80 L. Ed. 660 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932). While it was “possible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action [might] also be safeguarded against state action,” the Court stated, this was “not because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.” Twining, 211 U.S., at 99, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97.

The Court used different formulations in describing the boundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the Court referred to “immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard.” Id., at 102, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934), the Court spoke of rights that are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the Court famously said that due process protects those rights that are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty” and essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.” 302 U.S., at 325, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288.

Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court “can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968). Thus, in holding that due process prohibits a State from taking private property without just compensation, the Court described the right as “a principle of natural equity, recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., supra, at 238, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979. Similarly, the Court found that due process did not provide a right against compelled incrimination in part because this right “has no place in the jurisprudence of civilized and free  countries outside the domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97.

Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such rights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 1357 (1931) (same); Powell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De Jonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S. Ct. 900, 84 L. Ed. 1213 (1940) (free exercise of religion). But others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury indictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege against self-incrimination).

Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from the protection or remedies provided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To give one example, in Betts the Court held that, although the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceedings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case . . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fairness.” 316 U.S., at 473, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949), the Court held that the “core of the Fourth Amendment was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause”  but that the exclusionary rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the States. Id., at 27-28, 33, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782.

2 

An alternative theory regarding the relationship between the Bill of Rights and§ 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was  championed by Justice Black. This theory held that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g., Adamson, supra, at 71-72, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan, supra, at 166, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amendment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and, in so doing, overruled this Court's decision in Barron.9Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated that the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong. Globe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text of § 1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089-1090; A. Amar, TheBill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill of Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained the view that the rights guaranteed by § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Constitution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84 (1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation on the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe 2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: TheFourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30 statements during the debates in Congress interpreting § 1 to incorporate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as Amici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that “[n]ot a single senator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understanding” of the Fourteenth Amendment).Adamson, supra, at 72, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (dissenting opinion).10The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the significance of these statements. They contend that the phrase “privileges or immunities” is not naturally read to mean the rights set out in the first eight Amendments, see Brief for Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 13-16, and that “there is 'support in the legislative history for no fewer than four interpretations of the . . . Privileges or Immunities Clause,' ” Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Currie, The Reconstruction Congress, 75 U. Chi. L. Rev. 383, 406 (2008); brackets omitted). They question whether there is sound evidence of “ 'any strong public awareness of nationalizing the entireBill of Rights.' ” Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Wildenthal, Nationalizing the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866-67, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509, 1600 (2007)). Scholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, e.g., Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of Rights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St. L. J. 435 (1981). Proponents of the view that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States respond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used interchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64-65, and that the position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the Amendment was widely publicized and understood, see, e.g., Wildenthal, supra, at 1564-1565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695 (2009). A number of scholars have found support for the total incorporation of the Bill of Rights. See Curtis, supra, 57-130; Aynes, On Misreading John Bingham and the Fourteenth Amendment, 103 Yale L. J. 57, 61 (1993); see also Amar, Bill of Rights 181-230. We take no position with respect to this academic debate. Nonetheless,  the Court never has embraced Justice Black's “total incorporation” theory.

3 

While Justice Black's theory was never adopted, the Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating what has been called a process of “selective incorporation,” i.e., the Court began to hold that  the Due Process Clause fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U.S. 335, 341, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 5-6, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403-404, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965); Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 18, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); Duncan, 391 U.S., at 147-148, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969).

The decisions during this time abandoned three of the previously noted characteristics of the earlier period.11By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition that the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clausepresent different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumerated rights, we have required that a right also be “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether any “civilized system [can] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan, 391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. Instead, the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at 149, and n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; see also id., at 148, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (referring to those “fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions” (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).

The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.12With respect to the First Amendment, see Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947) (Establishment Clause); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 60 S. Ct. 900, 84 L. Ed. 1213 (1940) (Free Exercise Clause); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353, 57 S. Ct. 255, 81 L. Ed. 278 (1937) (freedom of assembly); Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925) (free speech); Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 1357 (1931) (freedom of the press). With respect to the Fourth Amendment, see Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964) (warrant requirement); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513 (1961) (exclusionary rule); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949) (freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures). With respect to the Fifth Amendment, see Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964) (privilege against self-incrimination); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979 (1897) (Just Compensation Clause). With respect to the Sixth Amendment, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968) (trial by jury in criminal cases); Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967) (compulsory process); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967) (speedy trial); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965) (right to confront adverse witness); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963) (assistance of counsel); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 68 S. Ct. 499, 92 L. Ed. 682 (1948) (right to a public trial). With respect to the Eighth Amendment, see Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S. Ct. 1417, 8 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1962) (cruel and unusual punishment); Schilb v. Kuebel, 404 U.S. 357, 92 S. Ct. 479, 30 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1971) (prohibition against excessive bail). Only a handful of the Bill of Rights protections remain unincorporated.13In addition to the right to keep and bear arms (and the Sixth Amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict, see n. 14, infra), the only rights not fully incorporated are (1) the Third Amendment's protection against quartering of soldiers; (2) the Fifth Amendment's grand jury indictment requirement; (3) the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases; and (4) the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines. We never have decided whether the Third Amendment or the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States through the Due Process Clause. See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 276, n. 22, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989) (declining to decide whether the excessive-fines protection applies to the States); see also Engblom v. Carey, 677 F.2d 957, 961 (CA2 1982) (holding as a matter of first impression that the “Third Amendment is incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment for application to the states”). Our governing decisions regarding the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Seventh Amendment's civil jury requirement long predate the era of selective incorporation.

Finally,  the Court abandoned “the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,” stating that it would be “incongruous” to apply different standards “depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court.” Malloy, 378 U.S., at 10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653(internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of Rights protections “are all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.” Id., at 10, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653; see also Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655-656, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513 (1961); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 33-34, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 110, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964); Pointer, 380 U.S., at 406, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923; Duncan, supra, at 149, 157-158, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; Benton, 395 U.S., at 794-795, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707; Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 48-49, 105 S. Ct. 2479, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1985).14There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unanimous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unanimous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement of the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the Federal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca, 406 U.S., at 406, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in federal and state criminal trials, id., at 414-415, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Johnson, supra, at 381-382, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice Powell's concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not state, cases. Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well-established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply identically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson, supra, at 395-396, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (“In any event, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court remains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of Rights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment'sjury trial guarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application against both State and Federal Governments”. (footnote omitted).

Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier decisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States. See, e.g., Mapp, supra (overruling in part Wolf, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782); Gideon, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (overruling Betts, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595); Malloy, supra (overruling Adamson, 332 U.S. 46, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903, and Twining, 211 U.S. 78, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97); Benton, 395 U.S., at 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (overruling Palko, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288).

 III 

With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained, we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,391 U.S., at 149, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,” Washington v. Glucksberg,521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).

A 

Our decision in Heller points unmistakably to the answer.  Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day,15Citing Jewish, Greek, and Roman law, Blackstone wrote that if a person killed an attacker, “the slayer is in no kind of fault whatsoever, not even in the minutest degree; and is therefore to be totally acquitted and discharged, with commendation rather than blame.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 182 (1769). and in Heller, we held that individual self-defense is “the central component” of the Second Amendment right. 554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 662; see also id., at 628, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 679 (stating that the “inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right”). Explaining that “the need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute” in the home, ibid., we found that this right applies to handguns because they are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to 'keep' and use for protection of one's home and family,” id., at 628-629, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 679 (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 628, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 679 (noting that handguns are “overwhelmingly chosen by American society for [the] lawful purpose” of self-defense); id., at 629, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 680 (“[T]he American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon”). Thus, we concluded,  citizens must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.” Id., at 630, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d, at 680.

Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.Glucksberg, supra, at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 117 S. Ct. 2302, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored the right's origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self-defense, 554 U.S., at 592-593, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 664-672, and that by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was “one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen,” id., at 594, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 658.

Blackstone's assessment was shared by the American colonists. As we noted in Heller, King George III's attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760's and 1770's “provoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.”16For example, an article in the Boston Evening Post stated: “For it is certainly beyond human art and sophistry, to prove the British subjects, to whom the priviledge of possessing arms is expressly recognized by the Bill of Rights, and, who live in a province where the law requires them to be equip'd with arms, are guilty of an illegal act, in calling upon one another to be provided with them, as the law directs.” Boston Evening Post, Feb. 6, 1769, in Boston Under Military Rule 1768-1769, p. 61 (1936) (emphasis deleted).Ibid.; see also L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 137-143 (1999) (hereinafter Levy).

The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights. “During the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.” Heller, supra, at 598, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 661 (citing Letters from The Federal Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 234, 242 (H. Storing ed. 1981)); see also Federal Farmer: An Additional Number of Letters to the Republican, Letter XVIII (Jan. 25, 1788), in 17 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 360, 362-363 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino eds. 1995); S. Halbrook, The Founders' Second Amendment171-278  (2008). Federalists responded, not by arguing that the right was insufficiently important to warrant protection but by contending that the right was adequately protected by the Constitution's assignment of only limited powers to the Federal Government. Heller, supra, at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike agreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the newly formed system of government. See Levy 143-149; J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 155-164 (1994). But those who were fearful that the new Federal Government would infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327-331 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1854); 3 id., at 657-661; 4 id., at 242-246, 248-249; see also Levy 26-34; 1 A. Kelly, W. Harbison, & H. Belz, The American Constitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th ed. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.

This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of Rights. In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820. Heller, supra, at 600-603, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. Founding-era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, described the right to keep and bear arms as “the true palladium of liberty” and explained that prohibitions on the right would place liberty “on the brink of destruction.” 1 Blackstone's Commentaries, Editor's App. 300 (S. Tucker ed. 1803); see also W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 125-126 (2d ed. 1829) ; 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of  the United States § 1890, p. 746 (1833) (“The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them”).

By the 1850's, the perceived threat that had prompted the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights --the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia--had largely faded as a popular concern, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for purposes of self-defense. See M. Doubler, Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War 87-90 (2003); Amar, Bill of Rights 258-259. Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right. See L. Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 66 (1860); J. Tiffany, A Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 117-118 (1849). And when attempts were made to disarm “Free-Soilers” in “Bloody Kansas,” Senator Charles Sumner, who later played a leading role in the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, proclaimed that “[n]ever was [the rifle] more needed in just self-defense than now in Kansas.” The Crime Against Kansas: The Apologies for the Crime: The True Remedy, Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner in the Senate of the United States 64-65 (1856). Indeed, the 1856 Republican Party Platform protested that in Kansas the constitutional rights of the people had been “fraudulently and violently taken from them” and the “right of the people to keep and bear arms” had been “infringed.” National Party Platforms 1840-1972, p. 27 (D. Johnson & K. Porter comp. 5th ed. 1973).17Abolitionists and Republicans were not alone in believing that the right to keep and bear arms was a fundamental right. The 1864 Democratic Party Platform complained that the confiscation of firearms by Union troops occupying parts of the South constituted “the interference with and denial of the right of the people to bear arms in their defense.” National Party Platforms 1840-1972, at 34.

 After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African-Americans who served in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confederacy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks. See Heller, 554 U.S., at 614, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; E. Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution 1863-1877, p. 8 (1988) (hereinafter Foner). The laws of some States formally prohibited African-Americans from possessing firearms. For example, a Mississippi law provided that “no freedman, free negro or mulatto, not in the military service of the United States government, and not licensed so to do by the board of police of his or her county, shall keep or carry fire-arms of any kind, or any ammunition, dirk or bowie knife.” Certain Offenses of Freedmen, 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, § 1, in 1 Documentary History of Reconstruction 289 (W. Fleming ed. 1950); see also Regulations for Freedmen in Louisiana, in id., at 279-280; H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 70, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 233, 236 (1866) (describing a Kentucky law); E. McPherson, The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction 40 (1871) (describing a Florida law); id., at 33 (describing an Alabama law).18In South Carolina, prominent black citizens held a convention to address the State's Black Code. They drafted a memorial to Congress, in which they included a plea for protection of their constitutional right to keep and bear arms: “ 'We ask that, inasmuch as the Constitution of the United States explicitly declares that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . . . that the late efforts of the Legislature of this State to pass an act to deprive us [of] arms be forbidden, as a plain violation of the Constitution.' ” S. Halbrook, Freedmen, TheFourteenth Amendment, and The Right to Bear Arms, 1866-1876, p. 9 (1998) (hereinafter Halbrook, Freedmen) (quoting 2 Proceedings of the Black State Conventions, 1840-1865, p. 302 (P. Foner & G. Walker eds. 1980)). Senator Charles Sumner relayed the memorial to the Senate and described the memorial as a request that black citizens “have the constitutional protection in keeping arms.” 39th Cong. Globe 337.

 Throughout the South, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Con-federate soldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves. In the first session of the 39th Congress, Senator Henry Wilson told his colleagues: “In Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages upon them; and the same things are done in other sections of the country.” 39th Cong. Globe 40 (1865). The Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction--which was widely reprinted in the press and distributed by Members of the 39th Congress to their constituents shortly after Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment19See B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction 265-266 (1914); Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 108-109, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (1947) (appendix to dissenting opinion of Black, J.). --contained numerous examples of such abuses. See, e.g., H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 219, 229, 272, pt. 3, pp. 46, 140, pt. 4, pp. 49-50 (1866); see also S. Exec. Doc. No. 2, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 23-24, 26, 36 (1865). In one town, the “marshal [took] all arms from returned colored soldiers, and [was] very prompt in shooting the blacks whenever an opportunity occur[red].” H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 70, at 238 (internal quotation marks omitted). As Senator Wilson put it during the debate on a failed proposal to disband Southern militias: “There is one unbroken chain of testimony from all people that are loyal to this country, that the greatest outrages are perpetrated by armed men who go up and down the country searching houses, disarming people, committing outrages of every kind and description.” 39th Cong. Globe 915 (1866).20Disarmament by bands of former Confederate soldiers eventually gave way to attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. In debates over the later enacted Enforcement Act of 1870, Senator John Pool observed that the Klan would “order the colored men to give up their arms; saying that everybody would be Kukluxed in whose house fire-arms were found.” Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 2d Sess., 2719 (1870); see also H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 268, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1872).

 Union Army commanders took steps to secure the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms,21For example, the occupying Union commander in South Carolina issued an order stating that “[t]he constitutional rights of all loyal and well disposed inhabitants to bear arms, will not be infringed.” General Order No. 1, Department of South Carolina, January 1, 1866, in 1 Documentary History of Reconstruction 208 (W. Fleming ed. 1950). Union officials in Georgia issued a similar order, declaring that “ '[a]ll men, without the distinction of color, have the right to keep arms to defend their homes, families or themselves.' ” Cramer, Johnson, & Mocsary, “This Right is Not Allowed by Governments That Are Afraid of The People”: The Public Meaning of the Second Amendment When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified, 17 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 823, 854 (2010) (hereinafter Cramer) (quoting Right To Bear Arms, Phila., Pa., Christian Recorder, Feb. 24, 1866, pp. 1-2). In addition, when made aware of attempts by armed parties to disarm blacks, the head of the Freedmen's Bureau in Alabama “made public [his] determination to maintain the right of the negro to keep and to bear arms, and [his] disposition to send an armed force into any neighborhood in which that right should be systematically interfered with.” Joint Committee on Reconstruction, H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 140 (1866). but the 39th Congress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental.

The most explicit evidence of Congress' aim appears in § 14 of the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, which provided that “the right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, including the constitutional right to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.” 14 Stat. 176-177(emphasis added).22TheFreedmen's Bureau bill was amended to include an express reference to the right to keep and bear arms, see 39th Cong. Globe 654 (Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that the unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at 743 (Sen. Lyman Trumbull).Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that “all the citizens,” black and white, would have “the constitutional right to bear arms.”

The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was considered at the same time as the Freedmen's Bureau Act, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms.23There can be no doubt that the principal proponents of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 meant to end the disarmament of African-Americans in the South. In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its purpose as securing to blacks the “privileges which are essential to freemen.” Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described Mississippi law that “prohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having fire-arms” and explained that the bill would “destroy” such laws. Ibid. Similarly, Representative Sidney Clarke cited disarmament of freedmen in Alabama and Mississippi as a reason to support the Civil Rights Act and to continue to deny Alabama and Mississippi representation in Congress: “I regret, sir, that justice compels me to say, to the disgrace of the Federal Government, that the 'reconstructed' State authorities of Mississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers and arm the rebels fresh from the field of treasonable strife. Sir, the disarmed loyalists of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana are powerless to-day, and oppressed by the pardoned and encouraged rebels of those States. They appeal to the American Congress for protection. In response to this appeal I shall vote for every just measure of protection, for I do not intend to be among the treacherous violators of the solemn pledge of the nation.” Id., at 1838-1839.Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act guaranteed the “full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Ibid. This language was virtually identical to language in § 14 of the Freedmen's Bureau Act, 14 Stat. 176 (“the right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal”). And as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that one of the “laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal” was “the constitutional right to bear arms.” Ibid. Representative Bingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the same rights as enumerated in the Freedmen's Bureau bill, which of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep  and bear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen's Bureau Act, aimed to protect “the constitutional right to bear arms” and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See also Amar, Bill of Rights 264-265 (noting that one of the “core purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the Fourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances” of freedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to “affirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self-defense”).

Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential vetoes, and this Court's pre-Civil-War precedent persuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide full protection for the rights of blacks.24For example, at least one Southern court had held the Civil Rights Act to be unconstitutional. That court did so, moreover, in the course of upholding the conviction of an African-American man for violating Mississippi's law against firearm possession by freedmen. See Decision of Chief Justice Handy, Declaring the Civil Rights Bill Unconstitutional, N. Y. Times, Oct. 26, 1866, p. 2, col. 3. Today, it is generally accepted that  the Fourteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 389, 102 S. Ct. 3141, 73 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1982); see also Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi & Fine, Two Cheers for Professor Balkin's Originalism, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663, 669-670 (2009).

In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Samuel Pomeroy described three “indispensable” “safeguards of liberty under our form of Government.” 39th Cong. Globe 1182. One of these, he said, was the right to keep and bear arms:

“Every man . . . should have the right to bear arms for the defense of himself and family and his homestead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken open  and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the polluted wretch to another world, where his wretchedness will forever remain complete.” Ibid.

 Even those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment unnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, “have equal right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for self-defense.” Id., at 1073 (Sen. James Nye); see also Foner 258-259.25Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the right to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures. In speaking generally on Reconstruction, Representative Roswell Hart listed the “ 'right of the people to keep and bear arms' ” as among those rights necessary to a “republican form of government.” 39th Cong. Globe 1629. Similarly, in objecting to a bill designed to disarm Southern militias, Senator Willard Saulsbury argued that such a measure would violate the Second Amendment. Id., at 914-915. Indeed, the bill “ultimately passed in a form that disbanded militias but maintained the right of individuals to their private firearms.” Cramer 858.

Evidence from the period immediately following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms that the right to keep and bear arms was considered fundamental. In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament of freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the necessity of the right: “Disarm a community and you rob them of the means of defending life. Take away their weapons of defense and you take away the inalienable right of defending liberty.” “Thefourteenth amendment, now so happily adopted, settles the whole question.” Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued disarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook, Freedmen 120-131. Finally, legal commentators from the period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right. See, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America § 118, p. 145 (1867);  J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States § 239, pp. 152-153 (3d ed. 1875).

The right to keep and bear arms was also widely protected by state constitutions at the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms. See Calabresi & Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? 87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50 (2008).26More generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven other States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See Calabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52. Quite a few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover, explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I, § 28 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, § 17 (1818); Ky. Const., Art. XIII, § 25 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, § 7 (1850); Miss. Const., Art. I, § 15 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, § 8 (1865); Tex. Const., Art. I, § 13 (1869); see also Mont. Const., Art. III, § 13 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, § 24 (1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, § 24 (1889); see also State v. McAdams, 714 P.2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is more, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruction era by former Confederate States included a right to keep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, § 5 (1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, § 15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I, § 13 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, therefore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being among the foundational rights necessary to our system of government.27These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law enforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that did not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not pursue criminals beyond the town borders. See Brief for Rocky Mountain Gun Owners et al. as Amici Curiae 15. Settlers in the West and elsewhere, therefore, were left to “repe[l] force by force when the intervention of society . . . [was] too late to prevent an injury.” District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 595, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, 659 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The settlers' dependence on game for food and economic livelihood, moreover, undoubtedly undergirded these state constitutional guarantees. See id., at 599, 609, 615, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.

 In sum, it is clear that  the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.

Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents contend that Congress, in the years immediately following the Civil War, merely sought to outlaw “discriminatory measures taken against freedmen, which it addressed by adopting a non-discrimination principle” and that even an outright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as acceptable, “so long as it was not done in a discriminatory manner.” Brief for Municipal Respondents 7. They argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment “as an antidiscrimination rule,” and they cite statements to the effect that the section would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64. This argument is implausible.

First, while § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains “an antidiscrimination rule,” namely, the Equal Protection Clause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that § 1 does no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only discriminatory searches and seizures--and so on. We assume that this is not municipal respondents' view, so what they must mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for  special--and specially unfavorable--treatment. We reject that suggestion.

Second, municipal respondents' argument ignores the clear terms of the Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866, which acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If that law had used language such as “the equal benefit of laws concerning the bearing of arms,” it would be possible to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimination. But § 14 speaks of and protects “the constitutional right to bear arms,” an unmistakable reference to the right protected by the Second Amendment. And it protects the “full and equal benefit” of this right in the States. 14 Stat. 176-177. It would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a constitutional right that does not exist.

Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African-Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers. In the years immediately following the Civil War, a law banning the possession of guns by all private citizens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense. Any such law--like the Chicago and Oak Park ordinances challenged here--presumably would have permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction revealed, see supra, at 772, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917-918, those groups were widely involved in harassing blacks in the South.

Fourth, municipal respondents' purely antidiscrimination theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black Codes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the bearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have been left without  the means of self-defense--as had abolitionists in Kansas in the 1850's.

Fifth, the 39th Congress' response to proposals to disband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive. Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these militias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm them. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen, 20-21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate the members' right to bear arms, and it was ultimately decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their members. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, § 6, 14 Stat. 485, 487; Halbrook, Freedmen 68-69; Cramer 858-861. It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.

IV 

Municipal respondents' remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in Heller: that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.

Municipal respondents' main argument is nothing less than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation precedent and return (presumably for this case only) to a bygone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights “ 'recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of [their] justice.' ” Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U.S., at 238, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979). According to municipal respondents, if it is possible to imagine any civilized legal system that does not recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause does not make that right binding  on the States. Brief for Municipal Respondents 9. Therefore, municipal respondents continue, because such countries as England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 21-23.

This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases. See Duncan, 391 U.S., at 149, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. And the present-day implications of municipal respondents' argument are stunning. For example, many of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this country.28For example, the United States affords criminal jury trials far more broadly than other countries. See, e.g., Van Kessel, Adversary Excesses in the American Criminal Trial, 67 Notre Dame L. Rev. 403 (1992); Leib, A Comparison of Criminal Jury Decision Rules in Democratic Countries, 5 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 629, 630 (2008); Henderson, The Wrongs of Victim's Rights, 37 Stan. L. Rev. 937, 1003, n. 296 (1985); see also Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 624, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“In many significant respects the laws of most other countries differ from our law--including . . . such explicit provisions of our Constitution as the right to jury trial”). Similarly, our rules governing pretrial interrogation differ from those in countries sharing a similar legal heritage. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Legal Policy, Report to the Attorney General on the Law of Pretrial Interrogation: Truth in Criminal Justice Report No. 1 (Feb. 12, 1986), reprinted in 22 U. Mich. J. L. Ref. 437, 534-542 (1989) (comparing the system envisioned by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), with rights afforded by England, Scotland, Canada, India, France, and Germany). And the “Court-pronounced exclusionary rule . . . is distinctively American.” Roper, supra, at 624, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 415, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971) (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (noting that exclusionary rule was “unique to American jurisprudence” (internal quotation marks omitted))); see also Sklansky, Anti-Inquisitorialism, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 1634, 1648-1656, 1689-1693 (2009) (discussing the differences between American and European confrontation rules). If our understanding of the right to a jury trial, the right against self-incrimination,  and the right to counsel were necessary attributes of any civilized country, it would follow that the United States is the only civilized Nation in the world.

Municipal respondents attempt to salvage their position by suggesting that their argument applies only to substantive as opposed to procedural rights. Brief for Municipal Respondents 10, n. 3. But even in this trimmed form, municipal respondents' argument flies in the face of more than a half century of precedent. For example, in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 8, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947), the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Yet several of the countries that municipal respondents recognize as civilized have established state churches.29England and Denmark have state churches. See Torke, The English Religious Establishment, 12 J. Law & Religion 399, 417-427 (1995-1996) (describing legal status of Church of England); Constitutional Act of Denmark, pt. I, § 4 (1953) (“The Evangelical Lutheran Church shall be the Established Church of Denmark”). The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has attributes of a state church. See Christensen, Is the Lutheran Church Still the State Church? An Analysis of Church-State Relations in Finland, 1995 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 585, 596-600 (describing status of church under Finnish law). The Web site of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland states that the church may be usefully described as both a “state church” and a “folk church.” See J. Seppo, The Current Condition of Church-State Relations in Finland (2004), online at http://evl.fi/EVLen.nsf/Documents/838DDBEF4A28712AC225730F001F7C67?OpenDocument=EN (all Internet materials as visited June 23, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). If we were to adopt municipal respondents' theory, all of this Court's Establishment Clause precedents involving actions taken by state and local governments would go by the boards.

Municipal respondents maintain that the Second Amendment differs from all of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a deadly implement and thus has implications for public safety. Brief for Municipal Respondents 11. And they note that there is intense disagreement on the question whether the private  possession of guns in the home increases or decreases gun deaths and injuries. Id., at 11, 13-17.

The right to keep and bear arms, however, is not the only constitutional right that has controversial public safety implications. All of the constitutional provisions that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the prosecution of crimes fall into the same category. See, e.g., Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006) (“The exclusionary rule generates 'substantial social costs,' United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 907, [104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677] (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large”); Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 522, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) (reflecting on the serious consequences of dismissal for a speedy trial violation, which means “a defendant who may be guilty of a serious crime will go free”); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 517, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966) (Harlan, J., dissenting); id., at 542, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (White, J., dissenting) (objecting that the Court's rule “[i]n some unknown number of cases . . . will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets . . . to repeat his crime”); Mapp, 367 U.S., at 659, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081. Municipal respondents cite no case in which we have refrained from holding that a provision of the Bill of Rights is binding on the States on the ground that the right at issue has disputed public safety implications.

We likewise reject municipal respondents' argument that we should depart from our established incorporation methodology on the ground that making theSecond Amendment binding on the States and their subdivisions is inconsistent with principles of federalism and will stifle experimentation. Municipal respondents point out--quite correctly--that conditions and problems differ from locality to locality and that citizens in different jurisdictions have divergent views on the issue of gun control. Municipal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local governments to enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable, including a complete ban on the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense. Brief for Municipal Respondents 18-20, 23.

 There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to respect federalism and allow useful state experimentation, a federal constitutional right should not be fully binding on the States. This argument was made repeatedly and eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two-track approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of “selective incorporation,” Justice Harlan in particular, invoking the values of federalism and state experimentation, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the two-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 500-503, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957)(Harlan, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part); Mapp, supra, at 678-680, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081(Harlan, J., dissenting); Gideon, 372 U.S., at 352, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (Harlan, J., concurring); Malloy, 378 U.S., at 14-33, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380 U.S., at 408-409, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (Harlan, J., concurring in result); Washington, 388 U.S., at 23-24, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (Harlan, J., concurring in result); Duncan, 391 U.S., at 171-193, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Benton, 395 U.S., at 808-809, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 117, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and concurring in result in part).

Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test applicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal respondents' argument must be rejected. Under our precedents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels otherwise,30As noted above, see n. 13, supra, cases that predate the era of selective incorporation held that the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Seventh Amendment's civil jury requirement do not apply to the States. See Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884) (indictment); Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U.S. 211, 36 S. Ct. 595, 60 L. Ed. 961 (1916) (civil jury). As a result of Hurtado, most States do not require a grand jury indictment in all felony cases, and many have no grand juries. See Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics, D. Rottman & S. Strickland. State Court Organization 2004, pp. 213, 215-217 (2006) (Table 38), online at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/sco04.pdf.As a result of Bombolis, cases that would otherwise fall within the Seventh Amendment are now tried without a jury in state small claims courts. See, e.g., Cheung v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 121 Nev. 867, 124 P. 3d 550 (2005) (no right to jury trial in small claims court under Nevada Constitution). that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus limits (but by no means eliminates) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values. As noted by the 38 States that have appeared in this case as amici supporting petitioners, “[s]tate and local experimentation with reasonable firearms regulations will continue under the Second Amendment.” Brief for State of Texas et al. 23.

Municipal respondents and their amici complain that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to extensive and costly litigation, but this argument applies with even greater force to constitutional rights and remedies that have already been held to be binding on the States. Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the exclusionary rule “is not an individual right,” Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496, 504 (2009), but a “judicially created rule,” id., at 139, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d at 504, this Court made the rule applicable to the States. See Mapp, supra, at 660, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081. The exclusionary rule is said to result in “tens of thousands of contested suppression motions each year.” Stuntz, The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary Rule, 20 Harv. J. Law & Pub. Pol'y. 443, 444 (1997).

Municipal respondents assert that, although most state constitutions protect firearms rights, state courts have held that these rights are subject to “interest-balancing” and have sustained a variety of restrictions. Brief for Municipal Respondents 23-31. In Heller, however, we expressly rejected the argument that the scope of the Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial interest balancing, 554 U.S., at 633-635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, and this Court decades ago  abandoned “the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,” Malloy, supra, at 10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (internal quotation marks omitted).

As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not historically been understood to restrict the authority of the States to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and supporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms laws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller. Municipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the late 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 26-27 (citing Kalodimos v. Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 470 N.E.2d 266, 83 Ill. Dec. 308 (1984)); see also Reply Brief for Respondent NRA et al. 23, n. 7 (asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete ban on the possession of handguns). It is important to keep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 554 U.S., at 626, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 678. We made it clear in Heller that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.” Id., at 626-627, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 678. We repeat those assurances here. Despite municipal respondents' doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms.

Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in the first eight Amendments “because the reason for codifying the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs from the  purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in self-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Brief for Municipal Respondents 36-37. Municipal respondents suggest that the Second Amendment right differs from the rights heretofore incorporated because the latter were “valued for [their] own sake.” Id., at 33. But we have never previously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value, and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorporated--for example the right to counsel and the right to confront and subpoena witnesses--are clearly instrumental by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages one of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e., that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that right in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the Federal Government would disarm and thus disable the militias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was valued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554 U.S., at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 661. On the contrary, we stressed that the right was also valued because the possession of firearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As we put it, self-defense was “the central component of the right itself.” Id. at 599.

A 

We turn, finally, to the two dissenting opinions. Justice Stevens' eloquent opinion covers ground already addressed, and therefore little need be added in response. Justice Stevens would “ 'ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.' ” Post, at 865, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 974 (quoting Malloy, 378 U.S., at 24, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (Harlan, J., dissenting)). The question presented in this case, in his view, “is whether the particular  right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 883, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 986. He would hold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected against Federal Government infringement by the various provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 866, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 975.

As we have explained, the Court, for the past half-century, has moved away from the two-track approach. If we were now to accept Justice Stevens' theory across the board, decades of decisions would be undermined. We assume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for the individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous dissents.

The relationship between the Bill of Rights' guarantees and the States must be governed by a single, neutral principle. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Brennan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy, supra, at 10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (internal quotation marks omitted).

B 

Justice Breyer's dissent makes several points to which we briefly respond. To begin, while there is certainly room for disagreement about Heller's analysis of the history of the right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since Heller persuades us to reopen the question there decided. Few other questions of original meaning have been as thoroughly explored.

Justice Breyer's conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First, “there is no popular consensus” that the right is fundamental, post, at 920, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009;  second, the right does not protect minorities or persons neglected by those holding political power, post, at 921-922, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009; third, incorporation of the Second Amendment right would “amount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern, altering the constitutional relationship between the States and the Federal Government” and preventing local variations, Ibid.; and fourth, determining the scope of the Second Amendment right in cases involving state and local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical questions regarding matters that are outside their area of expertise, post, at 922-927, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1010-1013. Even if we believed that these factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.

First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if there is a “popular consensus” that the right is fundamental, and we see no basis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out, there is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as 4. Another brief submitted by 38 States takes the same position. Brief for State of Texas et al. as 6.

Second, petitioners and many others who live in high-crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second Amendment right does not protect minorities and those lacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in high-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illinois legislators representing Chicago districts called on the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to patrol the City's streets.31See Mack & Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to Chicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.The legislators noted that the number of Chicago homicide victims during the current year equaled the number of  American soldiers killed during that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that 80% of the Chicago victims were black.32Janssen & Knowles, Send in Troops? Chicago Sun-Times, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 2; see also Brief for NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 5, n. 4 (stating that in 2008, almost three out of every four homicide victims in Chicago were African-Americans); id., at 5-6 (noting that “each year [in Chicago], many times more African Americans are murdered by assailants wielding guns than were killed during the Colfax massacre” (footnote omitted)).Amici supporting incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend that the right is especially important for women and members of other groups that may be especially vulnerable to violent crime.33See Brief for Women State Legislators et al. 9-10, 14-15; Brief for Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership 3-4; see also Brief for Pink Pistols et al. in District of Columbia v. Heller, O. T. 2007, No. 07-290, pp. 5-11. If, as petitioners believe, their safety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the community would be enhanced by the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second Amendmentright protects the rights of minorities and other residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not being met by elected public officials.

Third, Justice Breyer is correct that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States, but this is always true when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations, but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. “[T]he enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.” Heller, 554 U.S., at 636, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 684. This conclusion is no more remarkable with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with respect to all the other limitations on state power found in the Constitution.

Finally, Justice Breyer is incorrect that incorporation will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms  restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical judgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we have noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that suggestion. See supra, at 785-786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 925-926. “The very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government--even the Third Branch of Government--the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting upon.” Heller, supra, at 634, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 683.

* * * 

In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States. See Duncan, 391 U.S., at 149, and n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in Heller. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.


Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.

Our Constitution divided the “powers of the new Federal Government into three defined categories, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.” INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1983). Article II vests “[t]he executive Power . . . in a President of the United States of America,” who must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, § 1, cl. 1; id.,§ 3. In light of “[t]he impossibility that one man should be able to perform all the great business of the State,” the Constitution provides for executive officers to “assist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties of his trust.” 30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1939).

Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower the President to keep these officers accountable--by removing them from office, if necessary. See generally Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160 (1926). This Court has determined, however, that this authority is not without limit. In Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611 (1935), we held that Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause. Likewise, in United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 6 S. Ct. 449, 29 L. Ed. 700, 21 Ct. Cl. 499 (1886), and Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (1988), the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officers--themselves responsible to the President--to remove their own inferiors. The parties do not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we do not do so.

We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not yet encountered by the Court. The question is whether these separate layers of protection may be combined. May the  President be restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United States?

We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is contrary to Article II's vesting of the executive power in the President. The President cannot “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” if he cannot oversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute them. Here the President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than one level of good-cause protection, even if the President determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or discharging them improperly. That judgment is instead committed to another officer, who may or may not agree with the President's determination, and whom the President cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees with him. This contravenes the President's “constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.” Id., at 693, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569.

 A 

After a series of celebrated accounting debacles, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116 Stat. 745. Among other measures, the Act introduced tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The Board is composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5-year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry--such as the New York Stock Exchange--that investigate and discipline their own members subject to Commission oversight. Congress created the Board as a private “nonprofit corporation,” and Board members and employees are not considered Government “officer[s] or employee[s]” for statutory purposes. 15 U.S.C. §§ 7211(a), (b). The Board can thus recruit its members and employees from  the private sector by paying salaries far above the standard Government pay scale. See §§ 7211(f)(4), 7219.1The current salary for the Chairman is $673,000. Other Board members receive $547,000. Brief for Petitioners 3.

 Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the Board is a Government-created, Government-appointed entity, with expansive powers to govern an entire industry. Every accounting firm--both foreign and domestic--that participates in auditing public companies under the securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight. §§ 7211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1). The Board is charged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the securities laws, the Commission's rules, its own rules, and professional accounting standards. §§ 7215(b)(1), (c)(4). To this end, the Board may regulate every detail of an accounting firm's practice, including hiring and professional development, promotion, supervision of audit work, the acceptance of new business and the continuation of old, internal inspection procedures, professional ethics rules, and “such other requirements as the Board may prescribe.” § 7213(a)(2)(B).

 The Board promulgates auditing and ethics standards, performs routine inspections of all accounting firms, demands documents and testimony, and initiates formal investigations and disciplinary proceedings. §§ 7213-7215 (2006 ed. and Supp. II). The willful violation of any Board rule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U.S.C. § 78a et seq. --a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years' imprisonment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural person). §§ 78ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.). And the Board itself can issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to and including the permanent revocation of a firm's registration, a permanent ban on a person's associating with any registered firm, and money penalties of $15 million ($750,000 for a natural person). § 7215(c)(4). Despite the provisions specifying that  Board members are not Government officials for statutory purposes, the parties agree that the Board is “part of the Government” for constitutional purposes, Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U.S. 374, 397, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995), and that its members are “ 'Officers of the United  States' ” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 125-126, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976) (per curiam) (quoting Art. II, § 2, cl. 2); cf. Brief for Petitioners 9, n. 1; Brief for United States 29, n. 8.

 The Act places the Board under the SEC's oversight, particularly with respect to the issuance of rules or the imposition of sanctions (both of which are subject to Commission approval and alteration). §§ 7217(b)-(c). But the individual members of the Board--like the officers and directors of the self-regulatory organizations--are substantially insulated from the Commission's control. The Commission cannot remove Board members at will, but only “for good cause shown,” “in accordance with” certain procedures. § 7211(e)(6).

Those procedures require a Commission finding, “on the record” and “after notice and opportunity for a hearing,” that the Board member

“(A) has willfully violated any provision of th[e] Act, the rules of the Board, or the securities laws;“(B) has willfully abused the authority of that member; or“(C) without reasonable justification or excuse, has failed to enforce compliance with any such provision or rule, or any professional standard by any registered public accounting firm or any associated person thereof.” § 7217(d)(3).

 Removal of a Board member requires a formal Commission order and is subject to judicial review. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 554(a), 556(a), 557(a), (c)(2)(B); 15 U.S.C. § 78y(a)(1). Similar  procedures govern the Commission's removal of officers and directors of the private self-regulatory organizations. See § 78s(h)(4). The parties agree that the Commissioners cannot themselves be removed by the President except under the Humphrey's Executor standard of “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” 295 U.S., at 620, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Brief for Petitioners 31; Brief for United States 43; Brief for Respondent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 31 (hereinafter PCAOB Brief); Tr. of Oral Arg. 47, and we decide the case with that understanding.

 B 

Beckstead and Watts, LLP, is a Nevada accounting firm registered with the Board. The Board inspected the firm, released a report critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation. Beckstead and Watts and the Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of which the firm is a member, then sued the Board and its members, seeking (among other things) a declaratory judgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers. App. 71.

Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers by conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board members without subjecting them to Presidential control. Id., at 67-68. Petitioners also challenged the Act under the Appointments Clause, which requires “Officers of the United States” to be appointed by the President with the Senate's advice and consent. Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. The Clause provides an exception for “inferior Officers,” whose appointment Congress may  choose to vest “in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.” Ibid. Because the Board is appointed by the SEC, petitioners argued that (1) Board members are not “inferior Officers” who may be appointed by “Heads of Departments”; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a “Departmen[t]”; and (3) even if it is,  the several Commissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its “Hea[d].” See App. 68-70. The United States intervened to defend the Act's constitutionality. Both sides moved for summary judgment; the District Court determined that it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a-117a.

A divided Court of Appeals affirmed. 537 F.3d 667, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 119 (CADC 2008). It agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction over petitioners' claims. Id., at 671. On the merits, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue was “a question of first impression,” as neither that court nor this one “ha[d] considered a situation where a restriction on removal passes through two levels of control.” Id., at 679. It ruled that the dual restraints on Board members' removal are permissible because they do not “render the President unable to perform his constitutional duties.” Id., at 683. The majority reasoned that although the President “does not directly select or supervise the Board's members,” id., at 681, the Board is subject to the comprehensive control of the Commission, and thus the President's influence over the Commission implies a constitutionally sufficient influence over the Board as well. Id., at 682-683. The majority also held that Board members are inferior officers subject to the Commission's direction and supervision, id., at 672-676, and that their appointment is otherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, id., at 676-678.

Judge Kavanaugh dissented. He agreed that the case was one of first impression, id., at 698, but argued that “the double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] . . . combine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control over the [Board],” id., at 697. Judge Kavanaugh also argued that Board members are not effectively supervised by the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers under the Appointments Clause. Id., at 709-712.

We granted certiorari. 556 U.S. 1234, 129 S. Ct. 2378, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1291 (2009).

  II 

We first consider whether the District Court had jurisdiction. We agree with both courts below that the statutes providing for judicial review of Commission action did not prevent the District Court from considering petitioners' claims.

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to review any Board rule or sanction. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 7217(b)(2)-(4), (c)(2). Once the Commission has acted, aggrieved parties may challenge “a final order of the Commission” or “a rule of the Commission” in a court of appeals under § 78y, and “[n]o objection . . . may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.” §§ 78y(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1).

The Government reads § 78y as an exclusive route to review. But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts. See, e.g.,28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 2201. Nor does it do so implicitly.  Provisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review unless the “statutory scheme” displays a “fairly discernible” intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue “are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.” Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200, 207, 212, 114 S. Ct. 771, 127 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, when Congress creates procedures “designed to permit agency expertise to be brought to bear on particular problems,” those procedures “are to be exclusive.” Whitney Nat. Bank in Jefferson Parish v. Bank of New Orleans & Trust Co., 379 U.S. 411, 420, 85 S. Ct. 551, 13 L. Ed. 2d 386 (1965). But we presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if “a finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review”; if the suit is “wholly collateral to a statute's review provisions”; and if the claims are “outside the agency's expertise.” Thunder Basin, supra, at 212-213, 114 S. Ct. 771, 127 L. Ed. 2d 29 (internal quotation marks  "omitted). These considerations point against any limitation on review here.

We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pursue their constitutional claims under the Government's theory. Section 78y provides only for judicial review of Commission action, and not every Board action is encapsulated in a final Commission order or rule.

The Government suggests that petitioners could first have sought Commission review of the Board's “auditing standards, registration requirements, or other rules.” Brief for United States 16. But petitioners object to the Board's existence, not to any of its auditing standards. Petitioners' general challenge to the Board is “collateral” to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought. Cf. McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 491-492, 111 S. Ct. 888, 112 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1991). Requiring petitioners to select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd procedure for Congress to choose, especially because only new rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 78s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).

Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction. Brief for United States 16-17. But the investigation of Beckstead and Watts produced no sanction, see id., at 7, n. 5; Reply Brief for Petitioners 29, n. 11, and an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject to judicial review, see § 7214(h)(2). So the Government proposes that Beckstead and Watts incur a sanction (such as a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for documents and testimony.Brief for United States 17. If the Commission then affirms, the firm will win access to a court of appeals--and severe punishment should its challenge fail.  We normally do not require plaintiffs to “bet the farm . . . by taking the violative action” before “testing the validity of the law,” MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 549 U.S. 118, 129, 127 S. Ct. 764, 166 L. Ed. 2d 604 (2007); accord, Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), and we do not consider this a  “meaningful” avenue of relief, Thunder Basin, 510 U.S., at 212, 114 S. Ct. 771, 127 L. Ed. 2d 29.

Petitioners' constitutional claims are also outside the Commission's competence and expertise. In Thunder Basin, the petitioner's primary claims were statutory; “at root . . . [they] ar[o]se under the Mine Act and f[e]ll squarely within the [agency's] expertise,” given that the agency had “extensive experience” on the issue and had “recently addressed the precise . . . claims presented.” Id., at 214-215, 114 S. Ct. 771, 127 L. Ed. 2d 29. Likewise, in United States v. Ruzicka, 329 U.S. 287, 67 S. Ct. 207, 91 L. Ed. 290 (1946), on which the Government relies, we reserved for the agency fact-bound inquiries that, even if “formulated in constitutional terms,” rested ultimately on “factors that call for [an] understanding of the milk industry,” to which the Court made no pretensions. Id., at 294, 67 S. Ct. 207, 91 L. Ed. 290. No similar expertise is required here, and the statutory questions involved do not require “technical considerations of [agency] policy.” Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 373, 94 S. Ct. 1160, 39 L. Ed. 2d 389 (1974). They are instead standard questions of administrative law, which the courts are at no disadvantage in answering.

We therefore conclude that § 78y did not strip the District Court of jurisdiction over these claims, which are properly presented for our review.2The Government asserts that “petitioners have not pointed to any case in which this Court has recognized an implied private right of action directly under the Constitution to challenge governmental action under the Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers principles.” Brief for United States 22. The Government does not appear to dispute such a right to relief as a general matter, without regard to the particular constitutional provisions at issue here. See, e.g.,Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.S. 61, 74, 122 S. Ct. 515, 151 L. Ed. 2d 456 (2001) ( equitable relief “has long been recognized as the proper means for preventing entities from acting unconstitutionally”); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 (1946) (“[I]t is established practice for this Court to sustain the jurisdiction of federal courts to issue injunctions to protect rights safeguarded by the Constitution”); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 149, 165, 167, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908). If the Government's point is that an Appointments Clause or separation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every other constitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority why that might be so.

 III 

We hold that  the dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitution's separation of powers.

 A 

 The Constitution provides that “[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.” Art. II, § 1, cl. 1. As Madison stated on the floor of the First Congress, “if any power whatsoever is in its nature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789).

The removal of executive officers was discussed extensively in Congress when the first executive departments were created. The view that “prevailed, as most consonant to the text of the Constitution” and “to the requisite responsibility and harmony in the Executive Department,” was that the executive power included a power to oversee executive officers through removal; because that traditional executive power was not “expressly taken away, it remained with the President.” Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), 16 Documentary History of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004). “This Decision of 1789 provides contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the Constitution's meaning since many of the Members of the First Congress had taken part in framing that instrument.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723-724, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). And it soon became the “settled and well understood construction of the Constitution.” Ex parte Hennen, 38 U.S. 230, 13 Pet. 230, 259, 10 L. Ed. 138 (1839).

The landmark case of Myers v. United States reaffirmed the principle that Article II confers on the President “the general administrative control of those executing the laws.” 272 U.S., at 164, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160. It is his responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The buck stops with the President, in Harry Truman's famous phrase. As we explained in Myers, the President therefore must have some “power of removing those for whom he can not continue to be responsible.” Id., at 117, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160.

Nearly a decade later in Humphrey's Executor, this Court held that Myers did not prevent Congress from conferring good-cause tenure on the principal officers of certain independent agencies. That case concerned the members of the Federal Trade Commission, who held 7-year terms and could not be removed by the President except for “ 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' 295 U.S., at 620, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 41). The Court distinguished Myers on the ground that Myers concerned “an officer [who] is merely one of the units in the executive department and, hence, inherently subject to the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief Executive, whose subordinate and aid he is.” 295 U.S., at 627, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611. By contrast, the Court characterized the FTC as “quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial” rather than “purely executive,” and held that Congress could require it “to act . . . independently of executive control.” Id., at 627-629, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611. Because “one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another, cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter's will,” the Court held that Congress had power to “fix the period during which [the Commissioners] shall continue in office, and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.” Id., at 629, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611.

Humphrey's Executor did not address the removal of inferior officers, whose appointment Congress may vest in heads of departments. If Congress does so, it is ordinarily the department head, rather than the President, who enjoys the power of removal. See Myers, supra, at 119, 127, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160; Hennen, supra, at 259-260, 13 Pet. 230, 10 L. Ed. 138. This Court has upheld for-cause limitations on that power as well.

In Perkins, a naval cadet-engineer was honorably discharged from the Navy because his services were no longer required. 116 U.S. 483, 6 S. Ct. 449, 29 L. Ed. 700, 21 Ct. Cl. 499. He brought a claim for his salary under statutes barring his peacetime discharge except by a court-martial or by the Secretary of the Navy “for misconduct.” Rev. Stat. §§ 1229, 1525. This Court adopted verbatim the reasoning of the Court of Claims, which had held that when Congress “ 'vests the appointment of inferior officers in the heads of Departments[,]  it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest.' 116 U.S., at 485, 6 S. Ct. 449, 29 L. Ed. 700, 21 Ct. Cl. 499. Because Perkins had not been “ 'dismissed for misconduct . . . [or upon] the sentence of a court-martial,' ” the Court agreed that he was “ 'still in office and . . . entitled to [his] pay.' ” Ibid.3 When Perkins was decided in 1886, the Secretary of the Navy was a principal officer and the head of a department, see Rev. Stat. § 415, and the Tenure of Office Act purported to require Senate consent for his removal. Ch. 154, 14 Stat. 430, Rev. Stat. § 1767. This requirement was widely regarded as unconstitutional and void (as it is universally regarded today), and it was repealed the next year. See Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 353, 24 Stat. 500; Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 167-168, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160 (1926); see also Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583 (1986). Perkins cannot be read to endorse any such restriction, much less in combination with further restrictions on the removal of inferiors. The Court of Claims opinion adopted verbatim by this Court addressed only the authority of the Secretary of the Navy to remove inferior officers.

We again considered the status of inferior officers in Morrison. That case concerned the Ethics in Government Act, which provided for an independent counsel to investigate allegations of crime by high executive officers. The counsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full powers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attorney General only “ 'for good cause.' 487 U.S., at 663, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 596(a)(1)). We recognized that the independent counsel was undoubtedly an executive officer, rather than “ 'quasi-legislative' ” or “ 'quasi-judicial,' ” but we stated as “our present considered view” that Congress had power to impose  good-cause restrictions on her removal. 487 U.S., at 689-691, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569. The Court noted that the statute “g[a]ve the Attorney General,” an officer directly responsible to the President and “through [whom]” the President could act, “several means of supervising or controlling” the independent counsel--“[m]ost importantly . . . the power to remove the counsel for good cause.” Id., at 695-696, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under those circumstances, the Court sustained the statute. Morrison did not, however, address the consequences of more than one level of good-cause tenure--leaving the issue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, “a question of first impression” in this Court. 537 F.3d, at 679; see id., at 698, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (dissenting opinion).

 B 

As explained, we have previously upheld limited restrictions on the President's removal power. In those cases, however, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power. It was the President--or a subordinate he could remove at will--who decided whether the officer's conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.

The Act before us does something quite different. It not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists. That decision is vested instead in other tenured officers--the Commissioners--none of whom is subject to the President's direct control. The result is a Board that is not accountable to the President, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.

The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference. Without a layer of insulation between the Commission and the Board, the Commission could remove a Board member at any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for what the Board does. The President could then hold the Commission to account for its supervision of the Board, to  of the same extent that he may hold the Commission to account for everything else it does.

A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of the President's review. Now the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will. The President therefore cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Board's conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the Commission accountable for everything else that it does. The Commissioners are not responsible for the Board's actions. They are only responsible for their own determination of whether the Act's rigorous good-cause standard is met. And even if the President disagrees with their determination, he is powerless to intervene--unless that determination is so unreasonable as to constitute “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Humphrey's Executor, 295 U.S., at 620, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611 (internal quotation marks omitted).

This novel structure does not merely add to the Board's independence, but transforms it. Neither the President, nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full control over the Board. The President is stripped of the power our precedents have preserved, and his ability to execute the laws--by holding his subordinates accountable for their conduct--is impaired.

That arrangement is contrary to Article II's vesting of the executive power in the President. Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board's failings to those whom he can oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Board's conduct. He is not the one who decides whether Board members are abusing their offices or neglecting their duties. He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board member's breach of faith. This violates the basic principle that  the President “cannot delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that goes with it,” because Article II “makes a single President responsible for the actions of  the Executive Branch.” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 712-713, 117 S. Ct. 1636, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).4Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 525-527, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 743-744 (opinion of Breyer, J.), the second layer of tenure protection does compromise the President's ability to remove a Board member the Commission wants to retain. Without a second layer of protection, the Commission has no excuse for retaining an officer who is not faithfully executing the law. With the second layer in place, the Commission can shield its decision from Presidential review by finding that good cause is absent--a finding that, given the Commission's own protected tenure, the President cannot easily overturn. The dissent describes this conflict merely as one of four possible “scenarios,” see post, at 525-526, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 743-744, but it is the central issue in this case: The second layer matters precisely when the President finds it necessary to have a subordinate officer removed, and a statute prevents him from doing so.

Indeed, if allowed to stand, this dispersion of responsibility could be multiplied. If Congress can shelter the bureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why not a third?  At oral argument, the Government was unwilling to concede that even five layers between the President and the Board would be too many. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48. The officers of such an agency--safely encased within a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections--would be immune from Presidential oversight, even as they exercised power in the people's name.

Perhaps an individual President might find advantages in tying his own hands. But  the separation of powers does not depend on the views of individual Presidents, see Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 879-880, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1991), nor on whether “the encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment,” New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 182, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1992). The President can always choose to restrain himself in his dealings with subordinates. He cannot, however, choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his choices by pretending that they are not his own.

The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability. The people do not vote for the “Officers of the United States.” Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. They instead look to the President to guide the “assistants or deputies . . . subject to his superintendence.” The Federalist No. 72, p. 487 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton). Without a clear and effective chain of command, the public cannot “determine on whom the blame or the punishment of a pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures ought really to fall.” Id., No. 70, at 476 (same). That is why the Framers sought to ensure that “those who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation, and the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as they ought, on the President, and the President on the community.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).

By granting the Board executive power without the Executive's oversight, this Act subverts the President's ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed--as well as the public's ability to pass judgment on his efforts. The Act's restrictions are incompatible with the Constitution's separation of powers.

 C 

Respondents and the dissent resist this conclusion, portraying the Board as “the kind of practical accommodation between the Legislature and the Executive that should be permitted in a 'workable government.' Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U.S. 252, 276, 111 S. Ct. 2298, 115 L. Ed. 2d 236 (1991) (MWAA) (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635, 72 S. Ct. 863, 96 L. Ed. 1153, 62 Ohio Law Abs. 417 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)); see, e.g.,post, at 519, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 739 (opinion of Breyer, J.). According to the dissent, Congress may impose multiple levels of for-cause tenure between the President and his subordinates when it “rests agency independence upon the need for technical expertise.” Post, at 531, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 747. The Board's mission is said to demand both “technical competence” and “apolitical expertise,” and its powers may only be exercised by “technical experts.” Ibid. (internal  quotation marks omitted). In this respect the statute creating the Board is, we are told, simply one example of the “vast numbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast numbers of different problems, [that] provide for, or foresee, their execution or administration through the work of administrators organized within many different kinds of administrative structures, exercising different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively mandated objectives.” Post, at 521, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 741.

No one doubts Congress's power to create a vast and varied federal bureaucracy. But where, in all this, is the role for oversight by an elected President?  The Constitution requires that a President chosen by the entire Nation oversee the execution of the laws. And the “ 'fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,' ” for “ '[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives--or the hallmarks--of democratic government.' Bowsher, 478 U.S., at 736, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583 (quoting Chadha, 462 U.S., at 944, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317).

One can have a government that functions without being ruled by functionaries, and a government that benefits from expertise without being ruled by experts. Our Constitution was adopted to enable the people to govern themselves, through their elected leaders. The growth of the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the concern that it may slip from the Executive's control, and thus from that of the people. This concern is largely absent from the dissent's paean to the administrative state.

For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of removal as a tool of supervision, concluding that the President's “power to get something done” more often depends on “who controls the agency's budget requests and funding, the relationships between one agency or department and another, . . . purely political factors (including Congress' ability  to assert influence),” and indeed whether particular unelected officials support or “resist” the President's policies. Post, at 524, 526, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 742, 744 (emphasis deleted). The Framers did not rest our liberties on such bureaucratic minutiae. As we said in Bowsher, supra, at 730, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583, “[t]he separated powers of our Government cannot be permitted to turn on judicial assessment of whether an officer exercising executive power is on good terms with Congress.”

In fact, the multilevel protection that the dissent endorses “provides a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power.” MWAA, supra, at 277, 111 S. Ct. 2298, 115 L. Ed. 2d 236. In a system of checks and balances, “[p]ower abhors a vacuum,” and one branch's handicap is another's strength. 537 F.3d, at 695, n. 4 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Even when a branch does not arrogate power to itself,” therefore, it must not “impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties.” Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 757, 116 S. Ct. 1737, 135 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1996).5The dissent quotes Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 138, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976) (per curiam), for the proposition that Congress has “broad authority to 'create' governmental ' “offices” ' and to structure those offices 'as it chooses.' ” Post, at 515, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 737. The Buckley Court put “ 'offices' ” in quotes because it was actually describing legislative positions that are not really offices at all (at least not under Article II). That is why the very next sentence of Buckley said, “ButCongress' power . . . is inevitably bounded by the express language” of the Constitution. 424 U.S., at 138-139, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (emphasis added).Congress has plenary control over the salary, duties, and even existence of executive offices. Only Presidential oversight can counter its influence. That is why the Constitution vests certain powers in the President that “the Legislature has no right to diminish or modify.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463 (J. Madison).6The dissent attributes to Madison a belief that some executive officers, such as the Comptroller, could be made independent of the President. See post, at 530, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 746-747. But Madison's actual proposal, consistent with his view of the Constitution, was that the Comptroller hold office for a term of “years, unless sooner removed by the President”; he would thus be “dependent upon the President, because he can be removed by him,” and also “dependent upon the Senate, because they must consent to his [reappointment] for every term of years.” 1 Annals of Cong. 612 (1789).

 The Framers created a structure in which “[a] dependence on the people” would be the “primary controul on the government.” The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Madison). That dependence is maintained, not just by “parchment barriers,” id., No. 48, at 333 (same), but by letting “[a]mbition . . . counteract ambition,” giving each branch “the necessary constitutional means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the others,” id., No. 51, at 349. A key “constitutional means” vested in the President--perhaps the key means--was “the power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.” 1 Annals of Cong., at 463. And while a government of “opposite and rival interests” may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No. 51, at 349, “[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.” Bowsher, supra, at 730, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583.

Calls to abandon those protections in light of “the era's perceived necessity,” New York, 505 U.S., at 187, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120, are not unusual. Nor is the argument from bureaucratic expertise limited only to the field of accounting. The failures of accounting regulation may be a “pressing national problem,” but “a judiciary that licensed extraconstitutional government with each issue of comparable gravity would, in the long run, be far worse.” Id., at 187-188, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120. Neither respondents nor the dissent explains why the Board's task, unlike so many others, requires more than one layer of insulation from the President--or, for that matter, why only two. The point is not to take issue with for-cause limitations in general; we do not do that. The question here is far more modest. We deal with the unusual situation, never before addressed by the Court, of two layers of for-cause tenure. And though it may be criticized as “elementary arithmetical logic,” post, at 535, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 750, two layers are not the same as one.

The President has been given the power to oversee executive officers; he is not limited, as in Harry Truman's lament, to “persuad[ing]” his unelected subordinates “to do what  they ought to do without persuasion.” Post, at 524, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 743 (internal quotation marks omitted). In its pursuit of a “workable government,” Congress cannot reduce the Chief Magistrate to a cajoler-in-chief.

 D 

The United States concedes that some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the Constitution. See Brief for United States 47. It contends, however, that the removal restrictions at issue here do not.

To begin with, the Government argues that the Commission's removal power over the Board is “broad,” and could be construed as broader still, if necessary to avoid invalidation. See, e.g., id., at 51, and n. 19; cf. PCAOB Brief 22-23. But the Government does not contend that simple disagreement with the Board's policies or priorities could constitute “good cause” for its removal. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-43, 45-46. Nor do our precedents suggest as much. Humphrey's Executor, for example, rejected a removal premised on a lack of agreement “ 'on either the policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Commission,' ” because the FTC was designed to be “ 'independent in character,' ” “free from 'political domination or control,' ” and not “ 'subject to anybody in the government' ” or “ 'to the orders of the President.' 295 U.S., at 619, 625, 55 S. Ct. 869, 79 L. Ed. 1611. Accord, Morrison, 487 U.S., at 693, 108 S. Ct. 2597, 101 L. Ed. 2d 569 (noting that “the congressional determination to limit the removal power of the Attorney General was essential . . . to establish the necessary independence of the office”); Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356, 78 S. Ct. 1275, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1377, 142 Ct. Cl. 932 (1958) (describing for-cause removal as “involving the rectitude? of an officer). And here there is judicial review of any effort to remove Board members, see 15 U.S.C. § 78y(a)(1), so the Commission will not have the final word on the propriety of its own removal orders. The removal restrictions set forth in the statute mean what they say.

Indeed, this case presents an even more serious threat to executive control than an “ordinary” dual for-cause standard. Congress enacted an unusually high standard that must be met before Board members may be removed. A Board member cannot be removed except for willful violations of the Act, Board rules, or the securities laws; willful abuse of authority; or unreasonable failure to enforce compliance--as determined in a formal Commission order, rendered on the record and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing. § 7217(d)(3); see § 78y(a). The Act does not even give the Commission power to fire Board members for violations of other laws that do not relate to the Act, the securities laws, or the Board's authority. The President might have less than full confidence in, say, a Board member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery is not listed among the grounds for removal under § 7217(d)(3).7The Government implausibly argues that § 7217(d)(3) “does not expressly make its three specified grounds of removal exclusive,” and that “the Act could be construed to permit other grounds.” Brief for United States 51, n. 19. But having provided in § 7211(e)(6) that Board members are to be removed “in accordance with [ § 7217(d)(3)], for good cause shown,” Congress would not have specified the necessary Commission finding in § 7217(d)(3) --including formal procedures and detailed conditions--if Board members could also be removed without any finding at all. Cf. PCAOB Brief 6 (“Cause exists where” the § 7217(d)(3) conditions are met).

The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board member may be removed was drawn from statutes concerning private organizations like the New York Stock Exchange. Cf. §§ 78s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3). While we need not decide the question here, a removal standard appropriate for limiting Government control over private bodies may be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power of the United States.

Alternatively, respondents portray the Act's limitations on removal as irrelevant, because--as the Court of Appeals held--the Commission wields “at-will removal power over Board functions if not Board members.” 537 F.3d, at 683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27-28;  PCAOB Brief 48. The Commission's general “oversight and enforcement authority over the Board,” § 7217(a), is said to “blun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause removal,” 537 F.3d, at 683, and to leave the President no worse off than “if Congress had lodged the Board's functions in the SEC's own staff,” PCAOB Brief 15.

Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to the power to remove Board members. The Commission may, for example, approve the Board's budget, § 7219(b), issue binding regulations, §§ 7202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve the Board of authority, § 7217(d)(1), amend Board sanctions, § 7217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own, §§ 7202(b)(1), (c). But altering the budget or powers of an agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an inferior officer. The Commission cannot wield a free hand to supervise individual members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it.

Even if Commission power over Board activities could substitute for authority over its members, we would still reject respondents' premise that the Commission's power in this regard is plenary. As described above, the Board is empowered to take significant enforcement actions, and does so largely independently of the Commission. See supra, at 458-486, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 718-719. Its powers are, of course, subject to some latent Commission control. See supra, at 486-487, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 719. But the Act nowhere gives the Commission effective power to start, stop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive activities typically carried out by officials within the Executive Branch.

The Government and the dissent suggest that the Commission could govern and direct the Board's daily exercise of prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC rules, or by amending those of the Board. Brief for United States 27; post, at 528, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 745. Enacting general rules through the required notice and comment procedures is obviously a poor means of micromanaging the Board's affairs. See §§ 78s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U.S.C. § 553, 15 U.S.C. § 7202(a), PCAOB  Brief 24, n. 6.8Contrary to the dissent's assertions, see post, at 528-529, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 745, the Commission's powers to conduct its own investigations (with its own resources), to remove particular provisions of law from the Board's bailiwick, or to require the Board to perform functions “other” than inspections and investigations, § 7211(c)(5), are no more useful in directing individual enforcement actions. So the Government offers another proposal, that the Commission require the Board by rule to “secure SEC approval for any actions that it now may take itself.” Brief for United States 27. That would surely constitute one of the “limitations upon the  activities, functions, and operations of the Board” that the Act forbids, at least without Commission findings equivalent to those required to fire the Board instead. § 7217(d)(2). The Board thus has significant independence in determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs of regulated firms (and the lives of their associated persons) without Commission preapproval or direction.

Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is contradicted by the past practice of Congress. But the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of for-cause removal--including at one level a sharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes “good cause,” and rigorous procedures that must be followed prior to removal.

The parties have identified only a handful of isolated positions in which inferior officers might be protected by two levels of good-cause tenure. See, e.g., PCAOB Brief 43. As Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:

“Perhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of historical precedent for this entity. Neither the majority opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as intervenor has located any historical analogues for this novel structure. They have not identified any independent agency other than the PCAOB that is appointed by  and removable only for cause by another independent agency.” 537 F.3d, at 699.

The dissent here suggests that other such positions might exist, and complains that we do not resolve their status in this opinion. Post, at 536-544, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 750-755. The dissent itself, however, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal Government, see post, at 520-521, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 740-741, and those features discourage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed nor argued here. In any event, the dissent fails to support its premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies are similarly situated to the Board. See post, at 540-543, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 753-755.

For example, many civil servants within independent agencies would not qualify as “Officers of the United States,” who “exercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,” Buckley, 424 U.S., at 126, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659.9One “may be an agent or employe working for the government and paid by it, as nine-tenths of the persons rendering service to the government undoubtedly are, without thereby becoming its office[r].” United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 509, 25 L. Ed. 482 (1879). The applicable proportion has of course increased dramatically since 1879. The parties here concede that Board members are executive “Officers,” as that term is used in the Constitution. See supra, at 485-486, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 718; see also Art. II, § 2, cl. 2. We do not decide the status of other Government employees, nor do we decide whether “lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States” must be subject to the same sort of control as those who exercise “significant authority pursuant to the laws.” Buckley, supra, at 126, and n. 162, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659.

Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy the same significant and unusual protections from Presidential oversight as members of the Board. Senior or policymaking positions in government may be excepted from the competitive service to ensure Presidential control, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 2302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and members of the Senior Executive Service may be reassigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies may be excluded from that Service  by the President), see, e.g.,§§ 3132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf. § 2302(a)(2)(B)(ii). While the full extent of that authority is not before us, any such authority is of course wholly absent with respect to the Board. Nothing in our opinion, therefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially known as the civil service system within independent agencies.10For similar reasons, our holding also does not address that subset of independent agency employees who serve as administrative law judges. See, e.g.,5 U.S.C. §§ 556(c), 3105. Whether administrative law judges are necessarily “Officers of the United States” is disputed. See, e.g.,Landry v. FDIC, 204 F.3d 1125, 340 U.S. App. D.C. 237 (CADC 2000). And unlike members of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform adjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see §§ 554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers. The Government below refused to identify either “civil service tenure-protected employees in independent agencies” or administrative law judges as “precedent for the PCAOB.” 537 F.3d 667, 699, n. 8, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 119 (CADC 2008) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting); see Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 07-5127 (CADC), pp. 32, 37-38, 42.

Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests that today's opinion might increase the President's authority to remove military officers. Without expressing any view whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough to note that we see little analogy between our Nation's armed services and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Military officers are broadly subject to Presidential control through the chain of command and through the President's powers as Commander in Chief. Art. II, § 2, cl. 1; see, e.g.,10 U.S.C. §§ 162, 164(g). The President and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry or courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor performance by those officers. See, e.g.,§§ 822(a)(1), 823(a)(1), 892(3), 933-934,1181-1185. Here, by contrast, the President has no authority to initiate a Board member's removal for cause.

There is no reason for us to address whether these positions identified by the dissent, or any others not at issue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the President's  constitutional authority. Nor is there any substance to the dissent's concern that the “work of all these various officials” will “be put on hold.” Post, at 544, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 755. As the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting certain officers to a single level of insulation from the President affects the conditions under which those officers might some day be removed, and would have no effect, absent a congressional determination to the contrary, on the validity of any officer's continuance in office. The only issue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the President of adequate control over the Board, which is the regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement authority for a vital sector of our economy. We hold that it cannot.

 IV 

Petitioners' complaint argued that the Board's “freedom from Presidential oversight and control” rendered it  “and all power and authority exercised by it” in violation of the Constitution. App. 46. We reject such a broad holding. Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.

 “Generally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem,” severing any “problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.” Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U.S. 320, 328-329, 126 S. Ct. 961, 163 L. Ed. 2d 812 (2006). Because “[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,” Champlin Refining Co. v. Corporation Comm'n of Okla., 286 U.S. 210, 234, 52 S. Ct. 559, 76 L. Ed. 1062 (1932), the “normal rule” is “that partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 504, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 86 L. Ed. 2d 394 (1985). Putting to one side petitioners' Appointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the existence of the Board does not violate the separation of powers, but the substantive removal  restrictions imposed by 15 U.S.C. §§ 7211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do.  Under the traditional default rule, removal is incident to the power of appointment. See, e.g., Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 70, n. 17, 94 S. Ct. 937, 39 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1974); Myers, 272 U.S., at 119, 47 S. Ct. 21, 71 L. Ed. 160; Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet., at 259-260, 38 U.S. 230, 10 L. Ed. 138. Concluding that the removal restrictions are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will, and leaves the President separated from Board members by only a single level of good-cause tenure. The Commission is then fully responsible for the Board's actions, which are no less subject than the Commission's own functions to Presidential oversight.

 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains “ 'fully operative as a law' ” with these tenure restrictions excised. New York, 505 U.S., at 186, 112 S. Ct. 2408, 120 L. Ed. 2d 120 (quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684, 107 S. Ct. 1476, 94 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1987)). We therefore must sustain its remaining provisions “[u]nless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions . . . independently of that which is [invalid].” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Though this inquiry can sometimes be “elusive,” Chadha, 462 U.S., at 932, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317, the answer here seems clear: The remaining provisions are not “incapable of functioning independently,” Alaska Airlines, 480 U.S., at 684, 107 S. Ct. 1476, 94 L. Ed. 2d 661, and nothing in the statute's text or historical context makes it “evident” that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will. Ibid.; see also Ayotte, supra, at 330, 126 S. Ct. 961, 163 L. Ed. 2d 812.

It is true that the language providing for good-cause removal is only one of a number of statutory provisions that, working together, produce a constitutional violation. In theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a sufficient number of the Board's responsibilities so that its members would no longer be “Officers of the United States.” Or we could restrict the Board's enforcement powers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory panel. Or the Board  themembers could in future be made removable by  the President, for good cause or at will. But such editorial freedom--far more extensive than our holding today--belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary. Congress of course remains free to pursue any of these options going forward.

 V 

Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board under the Appointments Clause. None has merit.

First, petitioners argue that Board members are principal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the Senate's advice and consent. We held in Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 662-663, 117 S. Ct. 1573, 137 L. Ed. 2d 917 (1997), that  “[w]hether one is an 'inferior' officer depends on whether he has a superior,” and that “ 'inferior officers' are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level” by other officers appointed by the President with the Senate's consent. In particular, we noted that “[t]he power to remove officers” at will and without cause “is a powerful tool for control” of an inferior. Id., at 664, 117 S. Ct. 1573, 137 L. Ed. 2d 917. As explained above, the statutory restrictions on the Commission's power to remove Board members are unconstitutional and void. Given that the Commission is properly viewed, under the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove Board members at will, and given the Commission's other oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding that under Edmond the Board members are inferior officers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in a “Hea[d] of Departmen[t].”

But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a “Departmen[t]” like the “Executive departments” (e.g., State, Treasury, Defense) listed in 5 U.S.C. § 101. In Freytag, 501 U.S., at 887, n. 4, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764, we specifically reserved the question whether a “principal agenc[y], such as . . . the Securities and Exchange Commission,” is a “Departmen[t]” under the Appointments Clause. Four Justices, however, would have concluded that the Commission is indeed such a “Departmen[t],” see id., at 918, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), because it is a “free-standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,” id., at 915, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764.

Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those entities not addressed by our opinion in Freytag, see Brief for United States 37-39; PCAOB Brief 30-33, and we do. Respondents' reading of the Appointments Clause is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a “department” as a “separate allotment or part of business; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are allotted to a particular person.” 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995 facsimile ed.). It is also consistent with the early practice of Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster General to appoint “an assistant, and deputy postmasters, at all places where such shall be found necessary,” § 3, 1 Stat. 232 --thus treating him as the “Hea[d] of [a] Departmen[t]” without the title of Secretary or any role in the President's Cabinet. And it is consistent with our prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment. See Freytag, supra, at 917,  111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764; cf. Burnap v. United States, 252 U.S. 512, 515, 40 S. Ct. 374, 64 L. Ed. 692, 55 Ct. Cl. 516 (1920); United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 511, 25 L. Ed. 482 (1879).  Because the Commission is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component, it constitutes a “Departmen[t]” for the purposes of the Appointments Clause.11We express no view on whether the Commission is thus an “executive Departmen[t]” under the Opinions Clause, Art. II, § 2, cl. 1, or under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. See Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 886-887, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (1991).

But petitioners are not done yet. They argue that the full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board members, because only the Chairman of the Commission is the Commission's “Hea[d].”12The Board argued below that petitioners lack standing to raise this claim, because no member of the Board has been appointed over the Chairman's objection, and so petitioners' injuries are not fairly traceable to an invalid appointment. See Defendants' Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Complaint in Civil Action No. 1:06-cv-00217-JR (DC), Doc. 17, pp. 42-43; Brief for Appellees PCAOB et al. in No. 07-5127 (CADC), pp. 32-33. We cannot assume, however, that the Chairman would have made the same appointments acting alone; and petitioners' standing does not require precise proof of what the Board's policies might have been in that counterfactual world. See Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 533, 82 S. Ct. 1459, 8 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1962)(plurality opinion). The Commission's powers, however, are generally vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone. See, e.g.,15 U.S.C. §§ 77s, 77t, 78u, 78w. The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive functions subject to the full Commission's policies. See Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, § 1(b)(1), 64 Stat. 1265. The Chairman is also appointed from among the Commissioners by the President alone, id.,§ 3, at 1266, which means that he cannot be regarded as “the head of an agency” for purposes of the Reorganization Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 904. (The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet the requirements of the Act, including its provision that “the head of an agency [may] be an individual or a commission or board with more than one member.”)13Petitioners contend that finding the Commission to be the head will invalidate numerous appointments made directly by the Chairman, such as those of the “heads of major [SEC] administrative units.” Reorg. Plan No. 10, § 1(b)(2), at 1266. Assuming, however, that these individuals are officers of the United States, their appointment is still made “subject to the approval of the Commission.” Ibid. We have previously found that the department head's approval satisfies the Appointments Clause, in precedents that petitioners do not ask us to revisit. See, e.g.,United States v. Smith, 124 U.S. 525, 532, 8 S. Ct. 595, 31 L. Ed. 534 (1888); Germaine, 99 U.S., at 511, 25 L. Ed. 482; United States v. Hartwell, 73 U.S. 385, 6 Wall. 385, 393-394, 18 L. Ed. 830 (1868).

As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a multimember body may not be the “Hea[d]” of a “Departmen[t]”  that it governs. The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the “Courts of Law,” Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, and each House of Congress, too, appoints its officers collectively, see Art. I, § 2, cl. 5;id.,§ 3, cl. 5. Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomination of principal officers in the President to avoid the perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in multimember bodies. Practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies. See Freytag, 501 U.S. at 918, 111 S. Ct. 2631, 115 L. Ed. 2d 764 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of 1923, ch. 265, § 2, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining “the head of the department” to mean “the officer or group of officers . . . who are not subordinate or responsible to any other officer of the department” (emphasis added)); 37 Op. Atty. Gen. 227, 231 (1933) (endorsing collective appointment by the Civil Service Commission). We conclude that the Board members have been validly appointed by the full Commission.

In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to broad injunctive relief against the Board's continued operations. But they are entitled to declaratory relief sufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and auditing standards to which they are subject will be enforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the Executive. See Bowsher, 478 U.S., at 727, n. 5, 106 S. Ct. 3181, 92 L. Ed. 2d 583 (concluding that a separation-of-powers violation may create a “here-and-now” injury that can be remedied by a court (internal quotation marks omitted)).

 * * * 

The Constitution that makes the President accountable to the people for executing the laws also gives him the power to do so. That power includes, as a general matter, the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his  duties. Without such power, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else. Such diffusion of authority “would greatly diminish the intended and necessary responsibility of the chief magistrate himself.” The Federalist No. 70, at 478.

While we have sustained in certain cases limits on the President's removal power, the Act before us imposes a new type of restriction--two levels of protection from removal for those who nonetheless exercise significant executive power. Congress cannot limit the President's authority in this way.

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether a federal habeas court is barred from considering an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim as "cause" for the procedural default of another claim when the ineffective-assistance claim has itself been procedurally defaulted.

I

Respondent was indicted by an Ohio grand jury for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. He entered a guilty plea while maintaining his innocence -- a procedure we held to be constitutional inNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162, 91 S. Ct. 160 (1970) -- in exchange for the prosecution's agreement that the guilty plea could be withdrawn if the three-judge panel that accepted it elected, after a mitigation hearing, to impose the death penalty. The panel accepted respondent's plea based on the prosecution's recitation of the evidence supporting the charges and, following a mitigation hearing, sentenced him to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after 30 years on the aggravated-murder count and to a concurrent term of 10 to 25 years on the aggravated-robbery count. On direct appeal respondent, represented by new counsel, assigned only the single error that the evidence offered in mitigation established that he should have been  eligible for parole after 20 rather than 30 years. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, and respondent did not appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.

After unsuccessfully pursuing state postconviction relief pro se, respondent, again represented by new counsel, filed an application in the Ohio Court of Appeals to reopen his direct appeal, pursuant to Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(B), 1Rule 26(B) provides, in relevant part:"(1) A defendant in a criminal case may apply for reopening of the appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence, based on a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. An application for reopening shall be filed in the court of appeals where the appeal was decided within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time." on the ground that his original appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise on direct appeal a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. The appellate court dismissed the application because respondent had failed to show, as the rule required, good cause for filing after the 90-day period allowed. 2Respondent filed his application to reopen on July 15, 1994. Although Rule 26(B) did not become effective until July 1, 1993, more than two years after respondent's direct appeal was completed, the Court of Appeals considered respondent's time for filing to have begun on the Rule's effective date and to have expired 90 days thereafter. The Ohio Supreme Court, in a one-sentence per curiam opinion, affirmed.  State v. Carpenter,74 Ohio St. 3d 408, 659 N.E.2d 786 (1996)

On May 3, 1996, respondent filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging, inter alia, that the evidence supporting his plea and sentence was insufficient, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and that his appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise that claim on direct appeal. Concluding that respondent's sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim was procedurally defaulted, the District Court considered next whether the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim could  serve as cause excusing that default. The District Court acknowledged that the ineffective-assistance claim had been dismissed on procedural grounds, but concluded that Rule 26(B)'s inconsistent application by the Ohio courts rendered it inadequate to bar federal habeas review. See Ford v. Georgia,498 U.S. 411, 423-424, 112 L. Ed. 2d 935, 111 S. Ct. 850 (1991) (state procedural default is not an "independent and adequate state ground" barring subsequent federal review unless the state rule was "'firmly established and regularly followed'" at the time it was applied). Proceeding to the merits of the ineffective-assistance claim, the District Court concluded that respondent's appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective under the test established in Strickland v. Washington,466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), and granted the writ of habeas corpus conditioned on the state appellate court's reopening of respondent's direct appeal of the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.

On cross-appeals, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim served as "cause" to excuse the procedural default of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, whether or not the ineffective-assistance claim itself had been procedurally defaulted. Carpenter v. Mohr,163 F.3d 938 (CA6 1998). In the panel's view, it sufficed that respondent had exhausted the ineffective-assistance claim by presenting it to the state courts in his application to reopen the direct appeal, even though that application might, under Ohio law, have been time barred. Finding in addition prejudice from counsel's failure to raise the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim on direct appeal, the Sixth Circuit directed the District Court to issue the writ of habeas corpus conditioned upon the state court's according respondent a new culpability hearing. We granted certiorari.  528 U.S. 985, 120 S. Ct. 444, 145 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1999).

IIPetitioner contends that the Sixth Circuit erred in failing to recognize that a procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim can serve as cause to excuse the procedural default of another habeas claim only if the habeas petitioner can satisfy the "cause and prejudice" standard with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim itself. We agree.The procedural default doctrine and its attendant "cause and prejudice" standard are "grounded in concerns of comity and federalism," Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 730, 115 L. Ed. 2d 640, 111 S. Ct. 2546 (1991), and apply alike whether the default in question occurred at trial,  on appeal, or on state collateral attack, Murray v. Carrier,477 U.S. 478, 490-492, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397, 106 S. Ct. 2639 (1986). "[A] habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance." Coleman,501 U.S. at 732.We therefore require a prisoner to demonstrate cause for his state-court default of any federal claim, and prejudice therefrom, before the federal habeas court will consider the merits of that claim.  501 U.S. at 750. The one exception to that rule, not at issue here, is the circumstance in which the habeas petitioner can demonstrate a sufficient probability that our failure to review his federal claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Ibid.Although we have not identified with precision exactly what constitutes "cause" to excuse a procedural default, we have acknowledged that in certain circumstances counsel's ineffectiveness in failing properly to preserve the claim for review in state court will suffice.  Carrier,477 U.S. at 488-489.Not just any deficiency in counsel's performance will do, however; the assistance must have been so ineffective as to violate the Federal Constitution. Ibid. In other words, ineffective assistance adequate to establish cause for the procedural default of some other constitutional claim is itself an independent constitutional claim. And we held in Carrier that the principles of comity and federalism that underlie our longstanding exhaustion doctrine -- then as  now codified in the federal habeas statute, see 28 U.S.C. §§ 2254(b), (c) -- require that constitutional claim, like others, to be first raised in state court. "[A] claim of ineffective assistance," we said, generally must "be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default." Carrier, supra, at 489.The question raised by the present case is whether Carrier's exhaustion requirement for claims of ineffective assistance asserted as cause is uniquely immune from the procedural-default rule that accompanies the exhaustion requirement in all other contexts -- whether, in other words, it suffices that the ineffective-assistance claim was "presented" to the state courts, even though it was not presented in the manner that state law requires. That is not a hard question. An affirmative answer would render Carrier's exhaustion requirement illusory. 3Last Term, in a per curiam summary reversal, we clearly expressed the view that a habeas petitioner must satisfy the "cause and prejudice" standard before his procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance claim will excuse the default of another claim.  Stewart v. LaGrand,526 U.S. 115, 120, 143 L. Ed. 2d 196, 119 S. Ct. 1018 (1999). Respondent contends that we are not bound by LaGrand because in that case the habeas petitioner had waived his ineffective-assistance claim in the District Court, thereby rendering our procedural default discussion dicta, and because, in any event, per curiam opinions decided without the benefit of full briefing or oral argument are of little precedential value. Whether our procedural default analysis in LaGrand is properly characterized as dictum or as alternative holding, and whatever the precedential value of a per curiam opinion, the ease with which we so recently resolved this identical question reflects the degree to which the proper resolution flows irresistibly from our precedents.

We recognized the inseparability of the exhaustion rule and the procedural-default doctrine in Coleman: "In the absence of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas, habeas petitioners would be able to avoid the exhaustion requirement by defaulting their federal claims in state court . . . . The independent and adequate state  ground doctrine ensures that the States' interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases." Coleman, supra, at 732. We again considered the interplay between exhaustion and procedural default last Term in O'Sullivan v. Boerckel,526 U.S. 838, 144 L. Ed. 2d 1, 119 S. Ct. 1728 (1999), concluding that the latter doctrine was necessary to "'protect the integrity' of the federal exhaustion rule." Id. at 848 (quoting id. at 853 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)). The purposes of the exhaustion requirement, we said, would be utterly defeated if the prisoner were able to obtain federal habeas review simply by "'letting the time run'" so that state remedies were no longer available.  Id. at 848. Those purposes would be no less frustrated were we to allow federal review to a prisoner who had presented his claim to the state court, but in such a manner that the state court could not, consistent with its own procedural rules, have entertained it. In such circumstances, though the prisoner would have "concededly exhausted his state remedies," it could hardly be said that, as comity and federalism require, the State had been given a "fair 'opportunity to pass upon [his claims].'" Id. at 854 (STEVENS, J., dissenting (emphasis added) (quoting Darr v. Burford,339 U.S. 200, 204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950)).

To hold, as we do, that an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted as cause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally defaulted is not to say that that procedural default may not itself be excused if the prisoner can satisfy the cause-and-prejudice standard with respect to that claim. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit may well conclude on remand that respondent can meet that standard in this case (although we should note that respondent has not argued that he can, preferring instead to argue that he does not have to). Or it may conclude, as did the District Court, that Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(B) does not constitute an adequate procedural ground to bar federal habeas review of the ineffective-assistance claim. We express no view as to these issues, or on the question  whether respondent's appellate counsel was constitutionally ineffective in not raising the sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim in the first place.

 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


JUSTICE STEVENS announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Parts II and V. * JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE BREYER join this opinion in its entirety. JUSTICE O'CONNOR and JUSTICE KENNEDY join Parts I, III, and IV of this opinion.

The questions presented are whether Terry Williams' constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel as defined in Strickland v. Washington,466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), was violated, and whether the judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court refusing to set aside his death sentence "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States," within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III).  We answer both questions affirmatively.

I

On November 3, 1985, Harris Stone was found dead in his residence on Henry Street in Danville, Virginia. Finding no indication of a struggle, local officials determined that the cause of death was blood alcohol poisoning, and the case was considered closed. Six months after Stone's death, Terry Williams, who was then incarcerated in the "I" unit of the city jail for an unrelated offense, wrote a letter to the police stating that he had killed "'that man down on Henry Street'" and also stating that he "'did it'" to that "'lady down on West Green Street'" and was "'very sorry.'" The letter was unsigned, but it closed with a reference to "I cell." App. 41. The police readily identified Williams as its author, and, on April 25, 1986, they obtained several statements from him. In one Williams admitted that, after Stone refused to lend him "'a couple of dollars,'" he had killed Stone with a  mattock and took the money from his wallet. 1"'I had gone to Dee Dee Stone's house on Henry Street, Dee Dee's father was there. No one else was there except him. He had been drinking a lot. He was on the bed. He asked me if I wanted a drink. I told him, 'No.' I asked him if I could borrow a couple of dollars and he told me, 'No.' We started arguing and things started going around in my head. I just wanted to get back at him. I don't know what. He just laid back like he had passed out. He was laying there talking and moaning to himself. I went into the kitchen. I saw the butcher knife. I didn't want to use it. I was looking for something to use. I went into the bathroom and I saw the mattock. I picked up the mattock and I came back into the room where he was at. He was laying on the bed. He was laying on his back. I took the mattock and I hit him on the chest with it. He raised up and was gasping for his breath. He fell over to his side and I hit him in the back with the mattock. He fell back on the bed. I went and put the mattock back in the bathroom. I came back into the room. I took his wallet from his pocket. He had three dollars in it. I got the three dollars from it. I left him there. He was still grasping for breath.'" App. 4-5.Id. at  4. In September 1986, Williams was convicted of robbery and capital murder.

 At Williams' sentencing hearing, the prosecution proved that Williams had been convicted of armed robbery  in 1976 and burglary and grand larceny in 1982. The prosecution also introduced the written confessions that Williams had made in April. The prosecution described two auto thefts and two separate violent assaults on elderly victims perpetrated after the Stone murder. On December 4, 1985, Williams had started a fire outside one victim's residence before attacking and robbing him. On March 5, 1986, Williams had brutally assaulted an elderly woman on West Green Street -- an incident he had mentioned in his letter to the police. That confession was particularly damaging because other evidence established that the woman was in a "vegetative state" and not expected to recover. Id. at 60. Williams had also been convicted of arson for setting a fire in the jail while awaiting trial in this case. Two expert witnesses employed by the State testified that there was a "high probability"  that Williams would pose a serious continuing threat to society. Id. at 89.

The evidence offered by Williams' trial counsel at the sentencing hearing consisted of the testimony of Williams' mother,  two neighbors, and a taped excerpt from a statement by a psychiatrist. One of the neighbors had not been previously interviewed by defense counsel, but was noticed by counsel in the audience during the proceedings and asked to testify on the spot. The three witnesses briefly described Williams as a "nice boy" and not a violent person. Id. at 124. The recorded psychiatrist's testimony did little more than relate Williams' statement during an examination that in the course of one of his earlier robberies, he had removed the bullets from a gun so as not to injure anyone.

In his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, Williams' counsel repeatedly emphasized the fact that Williams had initiated the contact with the police that enabled them to solve the murder and to identify him as the perpetrator of the recent assaults, as well as the car thefts. In closing argument, Williams' counsel characterized Williams' confessional statements as "dumb," but asked the jury to give weight to the fact that he had "turned himself in, not on one crime but on four . . . that the [police otherwise] would not have solved." Id. at 140. The weight of defense counsel's closing, however,  was devoted to explaining that it was difficult to find a reason why the jury should spare Williams' life. 2In defense counsel's words: "I will admit too that it is very difficult to ask you to show mercy to a man who maybe has not shown much mercy himself. I doubt very seriously that he thought much about mercy when he was in Mr. Stone's bedroom that night with him. I doubt very seriously that he had mercy very highly on his mind when he was walking along West Green and the incident with Alberta Stroud. I doubt very seriously that he had mercy on his mind when he took two cars that didn't belong to him. Admittedly it is very difficult to get us and ask that you give this man mercy when he has shown so little of it himself. But I would ask that you would." Id. at 132-133.

 The jury found a probability of future dangerousness and unanimously fixed Williams' punishment at death. The trial judge concluded that such punishment was "proper" and "just" and imposed the death sentence. Id. at 154. TheVirginia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.  Williams v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 168, 360 S.E.2d 361 (1987), cert. denied, Williams v. Virginia, 484 U.S. 1020, 98 L. Ed. 2d 681, 108 S. Ct. 733 (1988). It rejected Williams' argument that when the trial judge imposed sentence, he  failed to give mitigating weight to the fact that Williams had turned himself in.  234 Va. at 181-182, 360 S.E.2d at 369-370.State Habeas Corpus Proceedings

In 1988 Williams filed for state collateral relief in the Danville Circuit Court. The petition was subsequently amended, and the Circuit Court (the same judge who had presided over Williams' trial and sentencing) held an evidentiary hearing on Williams' claim that trial counsel had been ineffective. 3While Williams' petition was pending before the Circuit Court, Virginia amended its state habeas statute to vest in the State Supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to award writs of habeas corpus in capital cases. Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-654(C)(1) (Supp. 1999). Shortly after the Circuit Court held its evidentiary hearing, the Supreme Court assumed jurisdiction over Williams' petition and instructed the Circuit Court to issue findings of fact and legal recommendation regarding Williams' ineffective-assistance claims. Based on the evidence adduced after two days of hearings, Judge Ingram found that Williams' conviction was valid, but that his trial attorneys had been ineffective during sentencing. Among the evidence reviewed that had not been presented at trial were documents prepared in connection with Williams' commitment when he was 11 years old that dramatically described mistreatment, abuse, and neglect during his early childhood, as well as testimony that he was "borderline mentally retarded," had suffered repeated head injuries, and might have mental impairments organic in origin. App. 528-529, 595. The habeas hearing also revealed that the same experts who had testified on the State's behalf at trial believed that Williams, if kept in a "structured environment," would not pose a future danger to society. Id. at 313-314.

Counsel's failure to discover and present this and other significant mitigating evidence was "below the range expected of reasonable, professional competent assistance of counsel." Id. at 424. Counsels' performance thus "did not measure up to the standard required under the holding of Strickland v. Washington,466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), and [if it had,] there is a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing phase would have been different." Id. at 429. Judge Ingram therefore recommended that Williams be granted a rehearing on the sentencing phase of his trial.

The Virginia Supreme Court did not accept that recommendation.  Williams v. Warden, 254 Va. 16, 487 S.E.2d 194 (1997). Although it assumed, without deciding, that trial counsel had been ineffective, id. at 23-26, 487 S.E.2d at 198, 200, it disagreed with the trial judge's conclusion that Williams had suffered sufficient prejudice to warrant relief. Treating the prejudice inquiry as a mixed question of law and fact, the Virginia Supreme Court accepted the factual determination that available evidence in mitigation had not been presented at the trial, but held that the trial judge had misapplied the law in two respects. First,  relying on our decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell,506 U.S. 364, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180, 113 S. Ct. 838 (1993), the court held that it was wrong for the trial judge to rely "'on mere outcome determination'" when assessing prejudice, 254 Va. at 23, 487 S.E.2d at 198 (quoting Lockhart, 506 U.S. at 369). Second, it construed the trial judge's opinion as having "adopted a per se approach" that  would establish prejudice whenever any mitigating evidence was omitted.  254 Va. at 26, 487 S.E.2d at 200.

The court then reviewed the prosecution evidence supporting the "future dangerousness" aggravating circumstance, reciting Williams' criminal history, including the several  most recent offenses to which he had confessed. In comparison, it found that the excluded mitigating evidence -- which it characterized as merely indicating "that numerous people, mostly relatives, thought that defendant was nonviolent and could cope very well in a structured environment," ibid. -- "barely would have altered the profile of this defendant that was presented to the jury," ibid. On this basis, the court concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that the omitted evidence would have affected the jury's sentencing recommendation, and that Williams had failed to demonstrate that his sentencing proceeding was fundamentally unfair.

Federal Habeas Corpus Proceedings

Having exhausted his state remedies, Williams sought a federal writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). After reviewing the state habeas hearing transcript and the state courts' findings of fact and conclusions of law, the federal trial judge agreed with the Virginia trial judge: The death sentence was constitutionally infirm.

After noting that the Virginia Supreme Court had not addressed the question whether trial counsel's performance at the sentencing hearing fell below the range of competence demanded of lawyers in criminal cases, the judge began by addressing that issue in detail. He identified five categories of mitigating evidence that counsel had failed to introduce, 4"(i) Counsel did not introduce evidence of the Petitioner's background . . . . (ii) Counsel did not introduce evidence that Petitioner was abused by his father. (iii) Counsel did not introduce testimony from correctional officers who were willing to testify that defendant would not pose a danger while incarcerated. Nor did counsel offer prison commendations awarded to Williams for his help in breaking up a prison drug ring and for returning a guard's wallet. (iv) Several character witnesses were not called to testify . . . . The testimony of Elliott, a respected CPA in the community, could have been quite important to the jury . . . . (v) Finally, counsel did not introduce evidence that Petitioner was borderline mentally retarded, though he was found competent to stand trial." App. 465-469. and he rejected the argument that counsel's failure to conduct an adequate investigation had been a strategic decision to rely almost entirely on the fact that Williams had voluntarily confessed.

 According to Williams' trial counsel's testimony before the state habeas court, counsel did not fail to seek Williams' juvenile and social services records because he thought they would be counterproductive, but because counsel erroneously believed that "'state law didn't permit it.'" App. 470. Counsel also acknowledged in the course of the hearings that information about Williams' childhood would have been important in mitigation. And counsel's failure to contact a potentially persuasive character witness was likewise not a conscious strategic choice, but simply a failure to return that witness' phone call offering his service. Id. at 470-471. Finally, even if counsel neglected to conduct such an investigation at the time as part of a tactical decision, the District Judge found, tactics as a matter of reasonable performance could not justify the omissions.

Turning to the prejudice issue, the  judge determined that there was "'a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694." Id. at 473. He found that the Virginia Supreme Court had erroneously assumed that Lockhart had modified the Strickland standard for determining prejudice, and that it had made an important error of fact in discussing its finding of no prejudice. 5"Specifically, the Virginia Supreme Court found no prejudice, reasoning: 'The mitigation evidence that the prisoner says, in retrospect, his trial counsel should have discovered and offered barely would have altered the profile of this defendant that was presented to the jury. At most, this evidence would have shown that numerous people, mostly relatives, thought that defendant was nonviolent and could cope very well in a structured environment.' Williams, 487 S.E.2d at 200. The Virginia Supreme Court ignored or overlooked the evidence of Williams' difficult childhood and abuse and his limited mental capacity. It is also unreasonable to characterize the additional evidence as coming from 'mostly relatives.' As stated, supra, Bruce Elliott, a respected professional in the community, and several correctional officers offered to testify on Williams behalf." Id. at 476. Having introduced his analysis of Williams' claim  with the standard of review applicable on habeas appeals provided by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (1994 ed., Supp. III), the judge concluded that those errors established that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision "was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law" within the meaning of § 2254(d)(1).

The Federal Court of Appeals reversed.  163 F.3d 860 (CA4 1998). It construed § 2254(d)(1) as prohibiting the grant of habeas corpus relief unless the state court "'decided the question by interpreting or applying the relevant precedent in a manner that reasonable jurists would all agree is unreasonable.'" Id., at 865 (quoting Green v. French, 143 F.3d 865, 870 (CA4 1998)). Applying that standard, it could not say that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision on the prejudice issue was an unreasonable application of the tests developed in either Strickland or Lockhart.6Like the Virginia Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that the performance of trial counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  163 F.3d at 867. It explained that the evidence that Williams presented a future danger to society was "simply overwhelming," 163 F.3d at 868, it endorsed the Virginia Supreme Court's interpretation of Lockhart, 163 F.3d at 869, and it characterized the state court's understanding of the facts in this case as "reasonable," 163 F.3d at 870.

We granted certiorari, 526 U.S. 1048 (1999), and now reverse.

II

In 1867, Congress enacted a statute providing that federal courts "shall have power to grant writs of habeas corpus in  all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States . . . . " Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385. Over the years, the federal habeas corpus statute has been repeatedly amended, but the scope of that jurisdictional grant remains the same. 7By Act of Congress: "(a) Writs of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts and any circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions . . . . (c) The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless -- . . . (3) He is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States . . . ." 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). In parallel, § 2254(a) provides: "The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."It is, of course, well settled that the  fact that constitutional error occurred in the proceedings that led to a state-court conviction may not alone be sufficient reason for concluding that a prisoner is entitled to the remedy of habeas. See, e.g., Stone v. Powell,428 U.S. 465, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067, 96 S. Ct. 3037 (1976); Brecht v. Abrahamson,507 U.S. 619, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353, 113 S. Ct. 1710 (1993). On the other hand, errors that undermine confidence in the fundamental fairness of the state adjudication certainly justify the issuance of the federal writ. See, e.g., Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 311-314, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989) (quoting Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 692-694, 28 L. Ed. 2d 404, 91 S. Ct. 1160 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part), and quoting Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 544, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982) (STEVENS, J., dissenting)). The deprivation of the right to the effective assistance of counsel recognized in Strickland is such an error.  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686, 697-698.

 The warden here contends that federal habeas corpus relief is prohibited by the amendment to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (1994 ed., Supp. III), enacted as a part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The relevant portion of that amendment provides:"(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim --"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; . . . ."

In this case, the Court of Appeals applied the construction of the amendment that it had adopted in its earlier opinion in Green v. French, 143 F.3d 865 (CA4 1998). It read the amendment as prohibiting federal courts from issuing the writ unless:"'(a) the state court decision is in 'square conflict' with Supreme Court precedent that is controlling as to law and fact or (b) if no such controlling decision exists, 'the state court's resolution of a question of pure law rests upon an objectively unreasonable derivation of legal principles from the relevant Supreme Court precedents, or if its decision rests upon an objectively unreasonable application of established principles to new facts,'" 163 F.3d at 865 (quoting Green, 143 F.3d at 870).Accordingly, it held that a federal court may issue habeas relief only if "the state courts have decided the question by interpreting or applying the relevant precedent in a manner that reasonable jurists would all  agree is unreasonable," 163 F.3d at 865. 8The warden's view is narrower. He argues that 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III) establishes a new general rule that prohibits federal courts from granting habeas corpus relief on the basis of any claim that a state court has adjudicated on the merits, and that § 2254(d)(1) merely identifies two narrow exceptions to the general rule -- when a state court has issued a decision "contrary to" or an "unreasonable application of" clearly established federal law. Brief for Respondent 14-15. The first, "contrary to" exception, in his view, applies only to "starkly unreasonable" errors of law. The first category thus imposes "a standard of review far more limited than 'de novo,' 'independent' or 'plenary' review." Id. at 24. The state-court judgment must thus be so far afield "as to make the 'unlawfulness' of the state court decision 'apparent.'" Id. at 25. The second exception likewise replaces the "de novo" standard of reviewing mixed questions of law and fact with the standard of "objective reasonableness" as formulated by the Court of Appeals. Id. at 30-31.

  We are convinced that that interpretation of the amendment is incorrect. It would impose a test for determining when a legal rule is clearly established that simply cannot be squared with the real practice of decisional law. 9Although we explain our understanding of "clearly established law," infra, at 14-17, we note that the Fourth Circuit's construction of the amendment's inquiry in this respect is especially problematic. It separates cases into those for which a "controlling decision" exists and those for which no such decision exists. The former category includes very few cases, since a rule is "controlling" only if it matches the case before the court both "as to law and fact," and most cases are factually distinguishable in some respect. A literal application of the Fourth Circuit test would yield a particularly perverse outcome in cases involving the Strickland rule for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel, since that case, which established the "controlling" rule of law on the issue, contained facts insufficient to show ineffectiveness. It would apply a standard for determining the "reasonableness" of state-court decisions that is not contained in the statute itself, and that Congress surely did not intend. And it would wrongly require the federal courts, including this Court, to defer to state judges' interpretations of federal law.

 As the Fourth Circuit would have it, a state-court judgment is "unreasonable" in the face of federal law only if all reasonable jurists would agree that the state court was unreasonable. Thus, in this case, for example, even if the Virginia Supreme Court misread our opinion in Lockhart, we could not grant relief unless we believed that none of the judges who agreed with the state court's interpretation of that case was a "reasonable jurist." But the statute says  nothing about "reasonable judges," presumably because all, or virtually all, such judges occasionally commit error; they make decisions that in retrospect may be characterized as "unreasonable." Indeed, it is most unlikely that Congress would deliberately impose such a requirement of unanimity on federal judges. As Congress is acutely aware, reasonable lawyers and lawgivers regularly disagree with one another. Congress surely did not intend that the views of one such judge who might think that relief is not warranted in a particular case should always have greater weight than the contrary, considered judgment of several other reasonable judges.

The inquiry mandated by the amendment relates to the way in which a federal habeas court exercises its duty to decide constitutional questions; the amendment does not alter the underlying grant of jurisdiction  in § 2254(a), see n. 7, supra. 10Indeed, Congress roundly rejected an amendment to the bill eventually adopted that directly invoked the text of the jurisdictional grant, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) (providing that the federal courts "shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus" (emphasis added)). The amendment read: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to a judgment or order of a State court shall not be entertained by a court of the United States unless the remedies in the courts of the State are inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of the person's detention." 141 Cong. Rec. 14991 (1995) (amendment of Sen. Kyl) (emphasis added). In speaking against the Kyl amendment, Senator Specter (a key proponent of the eventual habeas reform) explained that when "dealing with the question of jurisdiction of the Federal courts to entertain questions on Federal issues, on constitutional issues, I believe it is necessary that the Federal courts retain that jurisdiction as a constitutional matter." Id., at 15050 (statement of Sen. Specter).When federal judges exercise their federal-question jurisdiction under the "judicial Power" of Article III of the Constitution, it is "emphatically the province and duty" of those judges to "say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803). At the core of this  power is the federal courts' independent responsibility -- independent from its coequal branches in the Federal Government, and independent from the separate authority of the several States -- to interpret federal law. A construction of AEDPA that would require the federal courts to cede this authority to the courts of the States would be inconsistent with the practice that federal judges have traditionally followed in discharging their duties under Article III of the Constitution. If Congress had intended to require such an important change in the exercise of our jurisdiction, we believe it would have spoken with much greater clarity than is found in the text of AEDPA.

 This basic premise informs our interpretation of both parts of § 2254(d)(1): first, the requirement that the determinations of state courts be tested only against "clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States," and second, the prohibition on the issuance of the writ unless the state court's decision is "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of," that clearly established law. We address each part in turn.

The "clearly established law" requirement

In Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989), we held that the petitioner was not entitled to federal habeas relief because he was relying on a rule of federal law that had not been announced until after his state conviction became final. The antiretroactivity rule recognized in Teague, which prohibits reliance on "new rules," is the functional equivalent of a statutory provision commanding exclusive reliance on "clearly established law." Because there is no reason to believe that Congress intended to require federal courts to ask both whether a rule sought on habeas is "new" under Teague -- which remains the law -- and also whether it is "clearly established" under AEDPA, it seems safe to assume that Congress had congruent concepts in mind. 11It is not unusual for Congress to codify earlier precedent in the habeas context. Thus, for example, the exhaustion rule applied in Ex parte Hawk,321 U.S. 114, 88 L. Ed. 572, 64 S. Ct. 448 (1944)(per curiam), and the abuse of the writ doctrine applied in Sanders v. United States,373 U.S. 1, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148, 83 S. Ct. 1068 (1963), were later codified. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exhaustion requirement); 28 U.S.C. § 2254, Rule 9(b), Rules Governing § 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts. A previous version of § 2254, as we stated in Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.S. 104, 111, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405, 106 S. Ct. 445 (1985), "was an almost verbatim codification of the standards delineated in Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770, 83 S. Ct. 745 (1963), for determining when a district court must hold an evidentiary hearing before acting on a habeas petition."It is perfectly clear that AEDPA codifies Teague to the extent that Teague requires federal habeas courts to deny relief that is contingent upon a rule  of law not clearly established at the time the state conviction became final. 12We are not persuaded by the argument that because Congress used the words "clearly established law" and not "new rule," it meant in this section to codify an aspect of the doctrine of executive qualified immunity rather than Teague's antiretroactivity bar. Brief for Respondent 28-29, n. 19. The warden refers us specifically to § 2244(b)(2)(A) and 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III), in which the statute does in so many words employ the "new rule" language familiar to Teague and its progeny. Congress thus knew precisely the words to use if it had wished to codify Teague per se. That it did not use those words in § 2254(d) is evidence, the argument goes, that it had something else in mind entirely in amending that section. We think, quite the contrary, that the verbatim adoption of the Teague language in these other sections bolsters our impression that Congress had Teague -- and not any unrelated area of our jurisprudence -- specifically in mind in amending the habeas statute. These provisions, seen together, make it impossible to conclude that Congress was not fully aware of, and interested in codifying into law, that aspect of this Court's habeas doctrine. We will not assume that in a single subsection of an amendment entirely devoted to the law of habeas corpus, Congress made the anomalous choice of reaching into the doctrinally distinct law of qualified immunity, for a single phrase that just so happens to be the conceptual twin of a dominant principle in habeas law of which Congress was fully aware.

Teague's core principles are therefore relevant to our construction of this requirement. Justice Harlan recognized  the "inevitable difficulties" that come with "attempting 'to determine whether a particular decision has really announced a "new" rule at all or whether it has simply applied a well-established constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law.'" Mackey, 401 U.S. at 695 (quoting Desist v. United States,394 U.S. 244, 263, 22 L. Ed. 2d 248, 89 S. Ct. 1030 (1969)). But Teague established some guidance for making this determination, explaining that a federal habeas court operates within the bounds of comity and finality if it applies a rule "dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final." Teague, 489 U.S. at 301 (emphasis deleted). A rule that "breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government," ibid., falls outside this universe of federal law.

To this, AEDPA has added, immediately following the "clearly established law" requirement, a clause limiting the area of relevant law to that "determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (1994 ed., Supp. III). If this Court has not broken sufficient legal ground to establish an asked-for constitutional principle, the lower federal courts cannot themselves establish such a principle with clarity sufficient to satisfy the AEDPA bar. In this respect, we agree with the Seventh Circuit that this clause "extends the principle of Teague by limiting the source of doctrine on which a federal  court may rely in addressing the application for a writ." Lindh v. Murphy,96 F.3d 856, 869 (CA7 1996). As that court explained:"This is a retrenchment from former practice, which allowed the United States courts of appeals to rely on their own jurisprudence in addition to that of the Supreme Court. The novelty in this portion § 2254(d)(1) is not the 'contrary to' part but the reference to 'Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' (emphasis added). This extends the principle of Teague [v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 103 L. Ed. 2d 334, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989)] by limiting the  source of doctrine on which a federal court may rely in addressing the application for a writ. It does not, however, purport to limit the federal courts' independent interpretive authority with respect to federal questions." Ibid.A rule that fails to satisfy the foregoing criteria is barred by Teague from application on collateral review, and, similarly, is not available as a basis for relief in a habeas case to which AEDPA applies.

In the context of this case, we also note that, as our precedent interpreting Teague has demonstrated, rules of law may be sufficiently clear for habeas purposes even when they are expressed in terms of a generalized standard rather than as a bright-line rule. As JUSTICE KENNEDY has explained:"If the rule in question is one which of necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence, then we can tolerate a number of specific applications without saying that those applications themselves create a new rule . . . . Where the beginning point is a rule of this general application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent." Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 308-309, 120 L. Ed. 2d 225, 112 S. Ct. 2482 (1992) (opinion concurring in judgment).Moreover, the determination whether or not a rule is clearly established at the time a state court renders its final judgment of conviction is a question as to which the "federal courts must make an independent evaluation." Id., at 305 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment); accord id., at 307 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).

It has been urged, in contrast, that we should read Teague and its progeny to encompass a broader principle of deference requiring federal courts to "validate 'reasonable, good-faith interpretations' of the law" by state courts.  Brief for California et al. as Amici Curiae 6 (quoting Butler v. McKellar, 494 U.S. 407, 414, 108 L. Ed. 2d 347, 110 S. Ct. 1212 (1990)). The position has been bolstered with references to our statements elucidating the 'new rule' inquiry as one turning on whether "reasonable jurists" would agree the rule was not clearly established. Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227, 234, 111 L. Ed. 2d 193, 110 S. Ct. 2822 (1990). This presumption of deference was in essence the position taken by three Members of this Court in Wright, 505 U.S. at 290-291 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) ("[A] federal habeas court 'must defer to the state court's decision rejecting the claim unless that decision is patently unreasonable'")  (quoting Butler, 494 U.S. at 422 (Brennan, J., dissenting)).

Teague, however, does not extend this far. The often repeated language that Teague endorses "reasonable, good-faith interpretations" by state courts is an explanation of policy, not a statement of law. The Teague cases reflect this Court's view that habeas corpus is not to be used as a second criminal trial, and federal courts are not to run roughshod over the considered findings and judgments of the state courts that conducted the original trial and heard the initial appeals. On the contrary, we have long insisted that federal habeas courts attend closely to those considered decisions, and give them full effect when their findings and judgments are consistent with federal law. See Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 107-116, 133 L. Ed. 2d 383, 116 S. Ct. 457 (1995). But as JUSTICE O'CONNOR explained in Wright:"The duty of the federal court in evaluating whether a rule is 'new' is not the same as deference; . . . Teague does not direct federal courts to spend less time or effort scrutinizing the existing federal law, on the ground that they can assume the state courts interpreted it properly."The maxim that federal courts should 'give great weight to the considered conclusions of a coequal state judiciary' . . . does not mean that we have held in the past that federal courts must presume the correctness  of a state court's legal conclusions on habeas, or that a state court's incorrect legal determination has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have an independent obligation to say what the law is." 505 U.S. at 305.

We are convinced that in the phrase, "clearly established law," Congress did not intend to modify that independent obligation.

The "contrary to, or an unreasonable application of," requirement

The message that Congress intended to convey by using the phrases, "contrary to" and "unreasonable application of" is not entirely clear. The prevailing view in the Circuits is that the former phrase requires de novo review of 'pure' questions of law and the latter requires some sort of "reasonability"  review of so-called mixed questions of law and fact. See, e.g., Neelley v. Nagle, 138 F.3d 917 (CA11 1998); Drinkard v. Johnson, 97 F.3d 751 (CA5 1996); Lindh v. Murphy, 96 F.3d 856 (CA7 1996) (en banc), rev'd on other grounds, 521 U.S. 320, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997).

We are not persuaded that the phrases define two mutually exclusive categories of questions. Most constitutional questions that arise in habeas corpus proceedings -- and therefore most "decisions" to be made -- require the federal judge to apply a rule of law to a set of facts, some of which may be disputed and some undisputed. For example, an erroneous conclusion that particular circumstances established the voluntariness of a confession, or that there exists a conflict of interest when one attorney represents multiple defendants, may well be described either as "contrary to" or as an "unreasonable  application of " the governing rule of law. Cf.  Miller v. Fenton,474 U.S. 104, 116, 88 L. Ed. 2d 405, 106 S. Ct. 445 (1985); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 341-342, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333, 100 S. Ct. 1708 (1980). In constitutional adjudication, as in the common law, rules of law often develop  incrementally as earlier decisions are applied to new factual situations. See Wright, 505 U.S. at 307 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). But rules that depend upon such elaboration are hardly less lawlike than those that establish a bright-line test.

Indeed, our pre-AEDPA efforts to distinguish questions of fact, questions of law, and "mixed questions," and to create an appropriate standard of habeas review for each, generated some not insubstantial differences of opinion as to which issues of law fell into which category of question, and as to which standard of review applied to each. See Thompson, 516 U.S. at 110-111 (acknowledging "'that the Court has not charted an entirely clear course in this area'" and that "the proper characterization of a question as one of fact or law is sometimes slippery") (quotingMiller, 474 U.S. at 113). We thus think the Fourth Circuit was correct when it attributed the lack of clarity in the statute, in part, to the overlapping meanings of the phrases "contrary to" and "unreasonable application of." See Green,143 F.3d at 870.

The statutory text likewise does not obviously prescribe a specific, recognizable standard of review for dealing with either phrase. Significantly, it does not use any term, such as "de novo" or "plain error," that would easily identify a familiar standard of review. Rather, the text is fairly read simply as a command that a federal court not issue the habeas writ unless the state court was wrong as a matter of law or unreasonable in its application of law in a given case. The suggestion that a wrong state-court "decision" -- a legal judgment rendered "after consideration of facts, and . . . law," Black's Law Dictionary 407 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added) -- may no longer be redressed through habeas (because it is unreachable under the "unreasonable application" phrase) is based on a mistaken insistence that the § 2254(d)(1) phrases have not only independent, but mutually exclusive, meanings. Whether or not a federal court can issue the writ "under [the] 'unreasonable application' clause," the statute is  clear that habeas may issue under § 2254(d)(1) if a state court "decision" is "contrary to . . . clearly established Federal law." We thus anticipate that there will be a variety of cases, like this one, in which both phrases may be implicated. Even though we cannot conclude that the phrases establish "a body of rigid rules," they do express a "mood" that the federal judiciary must respect.  Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 487, 95 L. Ed. 456, 71 S. Ct. 456 (1951).In this respect, it seems clear that Congress intended federal judges to attend with the utmost care to state-court decisions, including all of the reasons supporting their decisions, before concluding that those proceedings were infected by constitutional error sufficiently serious to warrant the issuance of the writ. Likewise, the statute in a separate provision provides for the habeas remedy when a state-court decision "was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding." 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (emphasis added). While this provision is not before us in this case, it provides relevant context for our interpretation of § 2254(d)(1); in this respect, it bolsters our conviction that federal habeas courts must make as the starting point of their analysis the state courts' determinations of fact, including that aspect of a "mixed question" that rests on a finding of fact. AEDPA plainly sought to ensure a level of "deference to the determinations of state courts," provided those determinations did not conflict with federal law or apply federal law in an unreasonable way. H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-518, p. 111 (1996). Congress wished to curb delays, to prevent "retrials" on federal habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law. When federal courts are able to fulfill these goals within the bounds of the law, AEDPA instructs them to do so.

On the other hand, it is significant that the word "deference" does not appear in the text of the statute itself. Neither the legislative history, nor the statutory text suggests  any difference in the so-called "deference" depending on which of the two phrases is implicated. 13As Judge Easterbrook has noted, the statute surely does not require the kind of "deference" appropriate in other contexts: "It does not tell us to 'defer' to state decisions, as if the Constitution means one thing in Wisconsin and another in Indiana. Nor does it tell us to treat state courts the way we treat federal administrative agencies. Deference after the fashion of Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 . . . (1984), depends on delegation. See Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 108 L. Ed. 2d 585, 110 S. Ct. 1384 . . . (1990). Congress did not delegate interpretive or executive power to the state courts. They exercise powers under their domestic law, constrained by the Constitution of the United States. 'Deference' to the jurisdictions bound by those constraints is not sensible." Lindh v. Murphy,96 F.3d 856, 868 (CA7 1996) (en banc), rev'd on other grounds, 521 U.S. 320, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997). Whatever "deference" Congress had in mind with respect to both phrases, it surely is not a requirement that federal courts actually defer to a state-court application of the federal law that is, in the independent judgment of the federal court, in error. As Judge Easterbrook noted with respect to the phrase "contrary to":"Section 2254(d) requires us to give state courts'  opinions a respectful reading, and to listen carefully to their conclusions, but when the state court addresses a legal question, it is the law 'as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' that prevails." Lindh, 96 F.3d at 869. 14The Court advances three reasons for adopting its alternative construction of the phrase "unreasonable application of." First, the use of the word "unreasonable" in the statute suggests that Congress was directly influenced by the "patently unreasonable" standard advocated by JUSTICE THOMAS in his opinion in Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 287, 120 L. Ed. 2d 225, 112 S. Ct. 2482 (1992), post, at 12-14; second, the legislative history supports this view, see post, at 10, n.; and third, Congress must have intended to change the law more substantially than our reading 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1) (1994, Supp. III) permits.None of these reasons is persuasive. First, even though, as the Court recognizes, the term "unreasonable" is "difficult to define," post, at 12, neither the statute itself nor the Court's explanation of it, suggests that AEDPA's "unreasonable application of" has the same meaning as JUSTICE THOMAS'" 'patently unreasonable'" standard mentioned in his dictum in Wright. 505 U.S. at 291 (quoting Butler v. McKellar,494 U.S. 407, 422, 108 L. Ed. 2d 347, 110 S. Ct. 1212 (1990) (Brennan, J., dissenting)). To the extent the "broader debate" in Wright touched upon the Court's novel distinction today between what is "wrong" and what is "unreasonable," it was in the context of a discussion not about the standard of review habeas courts should use for law-application questions, but about whether a rule is "new" or "old" such that Teague's retroactivity rule would bar habeas relief; JUSTICE THOMAS contended that Teague barred habeas "whenever the state courts have interpreted old precedents reasonably, not [as JUSTICE O'CONNOR suggested] only when they have done so 'properly.'" 505 U.S. at 291-292, n. 8. Teague, of course, as JUSTICE O'CONNOR correctly pointed out, "did not establish a standard of review at all," 505 U.S. at 303-304; rather than instructing a court how to review a claim, it simply asks, in absolute terms, whether a rule was clear at the time of a state-court decision. We thus do not think Wright "confirms" anything about the meaning of § 2254(d)(1), which is, as our division reflects, anything but "clear." Post, at 14.As for the other bases for JUSTICE O'CONNOR's view, the only two specific citations to the legislative history upon which she relies, post, at 10, do no more than beg the question. One merely quotes the language of the statute without elaboration, and the other goes to slightly greater length in stating that state-court judgments must be upheld unless "unreasonable." Neither sheds any light on what the content of the hypothetical category of "decisions" that are wrong but nevertheless not "unreasonable." Finally, while we certainly agree with the Court, post, at 5, that AEDPA wrought substantial changes in habeas law, see supra, at 22; see also, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (strictly limiting second or successive petitions); § 2244(d) (1-year statute of limitations for habeas petitions); § 2254(e)(2) (limiting availability of evidentiary hearings on habeas); §§ 2263, 2266 (strict deadlines for habeas court rulings), there is an obvious fallacy in the assumption that because the statute changed pre-existing law in some respects, it must have rendered this specific change here.

  Our disagreement with JUSTICE O'CONNOR about the precise meaning  of the phrase "contrary to," and the word "unreasonable," is, of course, important, but should affect only a narrow category of cases. The simplest and first definition of "contrary to" as a phrase is "in conflict with." Webster's  Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 285 (1983). In this sense, we think the phrase surely capacious enough to include a finding that the state-court "decision" is simply "erroneous" or wrong. (We hasten to add that even "diametrically different" from, or "opposite" to, an established federal law would seem to include "decisions" that are wrong in light of that law.) And there is nothing in the phrase "contrary to" -- as JUSTICE O'CONNOR appears to agree -- that implies anything less than independent review by the federal courts. Moreover, state-court decisions that do not "conflict" with federal law will rarely be "unreasonable" under either her reading of the statute or ours. We all agree that state-court judgments must be upheld unless, after the closest examination of the state-court judgment, a federal court is firmly convinced that a federal constitutional right has been violated. Our difference is as to the cases in which, at first-blush, a state-court judgment seems entirely reasonable, but thorough analysis by a federal court produces a firm conviction that that judgment is infected by constitutional error. In our view, such an erroneous judgment is "unreasonable" within the meaning of the act even though that conclusion was not immediately apparent.

In sum, the statute directs federal courts to attend to every state-court judgment with utmost care, but it does not require them to defer to the opinion of every reasonable state-court judge on the content of federal law. If, after carefully weighing all the reasons for accepting a state court's judgment, a federal court is convinced that a prisoner's custody -- or, as in this case, his sentence of  death -- violates the Constitution, that independent judgment should prevail. Otherwise the federal "law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States" might be applied by the federal courts one way in Virginia and another way in California. In light of the well-recognized interest in ensuring that federal courts interpret federal law in a uniform  way, 15See, e.g., Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 689, 28 L. Ed. 2d 404, 91 S. Ct. 1160, (1971); Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 667, 135 L. Ed. 2d 827, 116 S. Ct. 2333 (1996) (SOUTER, J., concurring). Indeed, a contrary rule would be in substantial tension with the interest in uniformity served by Congress' modification in AEDPA of our previous Teague jurisprudence -- now the law on habeas review must be "clearly established" by this Court alone. See supra, at 16. It would thus seem somewhat perverse to ascribe to Congress the entirely inconsistent policy of perpetuating disparate readings of our decisions under the guise of deference to anything within a conceivable spectrum of reasonableness. we are convinced that Congress did not intend the statute to produce such a result.

IIIIn this case, Williams contends that he was denied his constitutionally guaranteed right to the effective assistance of counsel when his trial lawyers failed to investigate and to present substantial mitigating evidence to the sentencing jury. The threshold question under AEDPA is whether Williams seeks to apply a rule of law that was clearly established at the time his state-court conviction became final. That question is easily answered because the merits of his claim are squarely governed by our holding in Strickland v. Washington,466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).We explained in Strickland that a violation of the right on which Williams relies has two components:"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable." Id., at 687.To establish ineffectiveness, a "defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of  reasonableness." Id., at 688. To establish prejudice he "must  show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome." Id. at 694.It is past question that the rule set forth in Strickland qualifies as "clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." That the Strickland test "of necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence," Wright, 505 U.S. at 308 (KENNEDY, J., concurring), obviates neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as "established" by this Court. This Court's precedent "dictated" that the Virginia Supreme Court apply the Strickland test at the time that court  entertained Williams' ineffective-assistance claim.  Teague, 489 U.S. at 301. And it can hardly be said that recognizing the right to effective counsel "breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States," ibid. Williams is therefore entitled to relief if the Virginia Supreme Court's decision rejecting his ineffective-assistance claim was either "contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of," that established law. It was both.

IVThe Virginia Supreme Court erred in holding that our decision in Lockhart v. Fretwell,506 U.S. 364, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180, 113 S. Ct. 838 (1993), modified or in some way supplanted the rule set down in Strickland. It is true that while the Strickland test provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, there are situations in which the overriding focus on fundamental fairness may affect the analysis. Thus, on the one hand, as Strickland itself explained, there are a few situations in which prejudice may be presumed.  466 U.S. at 692. And, on the other hand, there are also situations in which it would be unjust to characterize the  likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate "prejudice." Even if a defendant's false testimony might have persuaded the jury to acquit him, it is not fundamentally unfair to conclude that he was not prejudiced by counsel's interference with his intended perjury.  Nix v. Whiteside,475 U.S. 157, 175-176, 89 L. Ed. 2d 123, 106 S. Ct. 988 (1986).

Similarly, in Lockhart, we concluded that, given the overriding interest in fundamental fairness, the likelihood of a different outcome attributable to an incorrect interpretation of the law should be regarded as a potential "windfall" to the defendant rather than the legitimate "prejudice" contemplated by our opinion in Strickland. The death sentence that Arkansas had imposed on Bobby Ray Fretwell was based on an aggravating circumstance (murder committed for pecuniary gain) that duplicated an element of the underlying felony (murder in the course of a robbery). Shortly before the trial, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had held that such "double counting" was impermissible, see Collins v. Lockhart,754 F.2d 258, 265 (1985), but Fretwell's lawyer (presumably because he was unaware of the Collins decision) failed to object to the use of the pecuniary gain aggravator. Before Fretwell's claim for federal habeas corpus relief reached this Court, the Collins case was overruled. 16In Lowenfield v. Phelps,484 U.S. 231, 98 L. Ed. 2d 568, 108 S. Ct. 546 (1988), we held that an aggravating circumstance may duplicate an element of the capital offense if the class of death-eligible defendants is sufficiently narrowed by the definition of the offense itself. In Perry v. Lockhart, 871 F.2d 1384 (1989), the Eighth Circuit correctly decided that our decision in Lowenfield required it to overrule Collins. Accordingly, even though the Arkansas trial judge probably would have sustained a timely objection to the double counting, it had become clear that the State had a right to rely on the disputed aggravating circumstance. Because the ineffectiveness of Fretwell's counsel had not deprived him of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitled him, we held that his  claim did not satisfy the "prejudice" component of the Strickland test. 17"But the 'prejudice' component of the Strickland test does not implicate these concerns. It focuses on the question whether counsel's deficient performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair. [466 U.S. at 687]; see Kimmelman, 477 U.S. at 393 (Powell, J., concurring). Unreliability or unfairness does not result if the ineffectiveness of counsel does not deprive the defendant of any substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him. As we have noted, it was the premise of our grant in this case that Perry was correctly decided, i.e., that respondent was not entitled to an objection based on 'double counting.' Respondent therefore suffered no prejudice from his counsel's deficient performance." Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 372, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180, 113 S. Ct. 838 (1993).

Cases such as Nix v. Whiteside,475 U.S. 157, 89 L. Ed. 2d 123, 106 S. Ct. 988 (1986), and Lockhart v. Fretwell,506 U.S. 364, 122 L. Ed. 2d 180, 113 S. Ct. 838 (1993), do not justify a departure from a straightforward application of Strickland when the ineffectiveness of counsel does deprive the defendant of a substantive or procedural right to which the law entitles him. 18In her concurring opinion in Lockhart, JUSTICE O'CONNOR stressed this precise point. "I write separately only to point out that today's decision will, in the vast majority of cases, have no effect on the prejudice inquiry under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). The determinative question -- whether there is 'a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,' id., at 694 -- remains unchanged. This case, however, concerns the unusual circumstance where the defendant attempts to demonstrate prejudice based on considerations that, as a matter of law, ought not inform the inquiry." 506 U.S. at 373. In the instant case, it is undisputed that Williams had a right -- indeed, a constitutionally protected right -- to provide the jury with the mitigating evidence that his trial counsel either failed to discover or failed to offer.

 Nevertheless, the Virginia Supreme Court read our decision in Lockhart to require a separate inquiry into fundamental fairness even when Williams is able to show that his lawyer was ineffective and that his ineffectiveness probably affected the outcome of the proceeding. It wrote:"'The prisoner argues there 'is a "reasonable probability" that at least one juror would have been moved to spare Petitioner's life had he heard' the mitigation evidence developed at the habeas hearing that was not presented at the trial. Summarizing, he contends there 'is a "reasonable probability" that had at least one juror heard any of this evidence -- let alone all of this evidence -- the outcome of this case would have been different.'"We reject these contentions. The prisoner's discussion flies in the face of the Supreme Court's admonition in Lockhart, supra, that 'an analysis focusing solely on mere outcome determination, without attention to whether the result of the proceeding was fundamentally unfair or unreliable, is defective.'" Williams,254 Va. at 25, 487 S.E.2d at 199.Unlike the Virginia Supreme Court, the state trial judge omitted any reference to Lockhart and simply relied on our opinion in Strickland as stating the correct standard for judging ineffective-assistance claims. With respect to the prejudice component, he wrote:"Even if a Petitioner shows that counsel's performance was deficient, however, he must also show  prejudice. Petitioner must show 'that there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result . . . would have been different.' Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. 'A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.' Id. Indeed, it is insufficient to show only that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding, because virtually every act or omission of counsel would meet that test.  Id. at 693. The petitioner bears the 'highly demanding' and 'heavy burden' in establishing actual prejudice." App. 417.The trial judge analyzed the ineffective-assistance claim under the correct standard; the Virginia Supreme Court did not.

We are likewise persuaded that the Virginia trial judge correctly applied both components of that standard to Williams' ineffectiveness claim. Although he concluded that counsel competently handled the guilt phase of the trial, he found that their representation during the sentencing phase fell short of professional standards -- a judgment barely disputed by the State in its brief to this Court. The record establishes that counsel did not begin to prepare for that phase of the proceeding until a week before the trial. Id. at 207, 227. They failed to conduct an investigation that would have uncovered extensive records graphically describing Williams' nightmarish childhood, not because of any strategic calculation but because they incorrectly thought that state law barred access to such records. Had they done so, the jury would have learned that Williams' parents had been imprisoned for the criminal neglect of Williams and his siblings, 19Juvenile records contained the following description of his home:"The home was a complete wreck . . . . There were several places on the floor where someone had had a bowel movement. Urine was standing in several places in the bedrooms. There were dirty dishes scattered over the kitchen, and it was impossible to step any place on the kitchen floor where there was no trash . . . . The children were all dirty and none of them had on under-pants. Noah and Lula were so intoxicated, they could not find any clothes for the children, nor were they able to put the clothes on them . . . . The children had to be put in Winslow Hospital, as four of them, by that time, were definitely under the influence of whiskey." App. 528-529. that Williams had been severely and repeatedly beaten by his father, that he had been committed to the custody of the social services bureau for two years during his parents' incarceration (including one stint in an abusive foster home), and then, after his parents were released from prison, had been returned to his parents' custody.

  Counsel failed to introduce available evidence that Williams was "borderline mentally retarded" and did not advance beyond sixth grade in school. Id. at 595. They failed to seek prison records recording Williams' commendations for helping to crack a prison drug ring and for returning a guard's missing wallet, or the testimony of prison officials who described Williams as among the inmates "least likely to act in a violent, dangerous or provocative way." Id. at 569, 588. Counsel failed even to return the phone call of a certified public accountant who had offered to testify that he had visited Williams frequently when Williams was incarcerated as part of a prison ministry program, that Williams "seemed to thrive in a more regimented and structured environment," and that Williams was proud of the carpentry  degree he earned while in prison. Id. at 563-566.

Of course, not all of the additional evidence was favorable to Williams. The juvenile records revealed that he had been thrice committed to the juvenile system -- for aiding and abetting larceny when he was 11 years old, for pulling a false fire alarm when he was 12, and for breaking and entering when he was 15. Id. at 534-536. But as the Federal District Court correctly observed, the failure to introduce the comparatively voluminous amount of evidence that did speak in Williams' favor was not justified by a tactical decision to focus on Williams' voluntary confession. Whether or not those omissions were sufficiently prejudicial to have affected the outcome of sentencing, they clearly demonstrate that trial counsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background. See 1 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-4.1, commentary, p. 4-55 (2d ed. 1980).

We are also persuaded, unlike the Virginia Supreme Court, that counsel's unprofessional service prejudiced Williams within the meaning of Strickland. After hearing the additional evidence developed in the postconviction proceedings, the very judge who presided at Williams' trial and who once  determined that the death penalty was "just" and "appropriate," concluded that there existed "a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing phase would have been different" if the jury had heard that evidence. App. 429. We do not agree with the Virginia Supreme Court that Judge Ingram's conclusion should be discounted because he apparently adopted "a per se approach to the prejudice element" that placed undue "emphasis on mere outcome determination." 254 Va. at 26-27, 487 S.E.2d at 200. Judge Ingram did stress the importance of mitigation evidence in making his "outcome determination," but it is clear that his predictive judgment rested on his assessment of the totality of the omitted evidence rather than on the notion that a single item of omitted evidence, no matter how trivial, would require a new hearing.The Virginia Supreme Court's own analysis of prejudice reaching the contrary conclusion was thus unreasonable in at least two respects. First, as we have already explained, the State Supreme Court mischaracterized at best the appropriate rule, made clear by this Court in Strickland, for determining whether counsel's assistance was effective within the meaning of the Constitution. While it may also have conducted an "outcome determinative" analysis of its own, 254 Va. at 27, 487 S.E.2d at 200, it is evident to us that the court's decision turned on its erroneous view that a "mere" difference in outcome is not sufficient to establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. See supra, at 26. Its analysis in this respect was thus not only "contrary to," but also, inasmuch as the Virginia Supreme Court relied on the inapplicable exception recognized in Lockhart, an "unreasonable application of" the clear law as established by this Court.

Second, the State Supreme Court's prejudice determination was unreasonable insofar as it failed to evaluate the totality of the available mitigation evidence -- both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding  -- in reweighing it against the evidence in aggravation. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S. 738, 751-752, 108 L. Ed. 2d 725, 110 S. Ct. 1441 (1990). This  error is apparent in its consideration of the additional mitigation evidence developed in the postconviction proceedings. The court correctly found that as to "the factual part of the mixed question," there was "really . . . no . . . dispute" that available mitigation evidence was not presented at trial.  254 Va. at 24, 487 S.E.2d at 198. As to the prejudice determination comprising the "legal part" of its analysis, id. at 23-25, 487 S.E.2d at 198-199, it correctly emphasized the strength of the prosecution evidence supporting the future dangerousness aggravating circumstance.

But the state court failed even to mention the sole argument in mitigation that trial counsel did advance -- Williams turned himself in, alerting police to a crime they otherwise would never have discovered, expressing remorse for his actions, and cooperating with the police after that. While this, coupled with the prison records and guard testimony, may not have overcome a finding of future dangerousness, the graphic description of Williams' childhood, filled with abuse and privation, or the reality that he was "borderline mentally retarded," might well have influenced the jury's appraisal of his moral culpability. See Boyde v. California,494 U.S. 370, 387, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316, 110 S. Ct. 1190 (1990). The circumstances recited in his several confessions are consistent with the view that in each case his violent behavior was a compulsive reaction rather than the product of cold-blooded premeditation. Mitigating evidence unrelated to dangerousness may alter the jury's selection of penalty, even if it does not undermine or rebut the prosecution's death-eligibility case. TheVirginia Supreme Court did not entertain that possibility. It thus failed to accord appropriate weight to the body of mitigation evidence available to trial counsel.

V

In our judgment, the state trial judge was correct both in his recognition of the established legal standard for determining  counsel's effectiveness, and in his conclusion that the entire postconviction record, viewed as a whole and cumulative of mitigation evidence presented originally, raised "a reasonable probability that the result of the sentencing proceeding would have been different" if competent counsel had presented and explained the significance of all the available evidence. It follows that the Virginia Supreme Court rendered a "decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law." Williams' constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel as defined in Strickland v. Washington,466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), was violated.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.


JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

 The issue in this case grows out of an Ex Post Facto Clause challenge to the retroactive application of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(h), which authorizes a district court to impose an additional term of supervised release following the reimprisonment of those who violate the conditions of an initial term. The United States argues that district courts had the power to do so under the prior law, and that this cures any ex post facto problems.  We agree with the Government as to the interpretation of prior law, and we find that consideration of the Ex Post Facto Clause is unnecessary. 

 I

In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, § 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999, Congress eliminated most forms of parole  in favor of  supervised release, a form of postconfinement monitoring overseen by the sentencing court, rather than the Parole Commission. See Gozlon-Peretz v. United States,498 U.S. 395, 400-401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919, 111 S. Ct. 840 (1991). The sentencing court was authorized to impose a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment, with the maximum length of the term varying according to the severity of the initial offense. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3583(a), (b). While on supervised release, the offender was required to abide by certain conditions, some specified by statute and some imposable at the court's discretion. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d). Upon violation of a condition, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V) authorized the court to "revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision . . . ." 1The current version of § 3583(e)(3) reads slightly differently, but for reasons discussed below, we focus on the law in effect at the time of Johnson's initial crime. Such was done here.

 In October 1993, petitioner Cornell Johnson violated 18 U.S.C. § 1029(b)(2), a Class D felony. In March 1994, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced him to 25 months' imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, the maximum term available under § 3583(b) for a Class D felony. Johnson was released from prison on August 14, 1995, having received good-conduct credits, and began serving his 3-year term of supervised release. Some seven months into that term, he was arrested in Virginia and later convicted of four state forgery-related offenses. He was thus found to have violated one of the conditions of supervised release made mandatory by § 3583(d), that he not commit another crime during his term of supervised release, and one imposed by the District Court, that he not leave the judicial district without permission. 

 The District Court revoked Johnson's supervised release, imposed a prison term of 18 months, and ordered Johnson placed on supervised release for 12 months following imprisonment. App. 40-41. For this last order, the District Court did not identify the source of its authority, though under Circuit law it might have relied on § 3583(h), a subsection added to the statute in 1994, see Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1996, § 110505(2)(B), 108 Stat. 2017. Subsection (h) explicitly gave district courts the power to impose another term of supervised release following imprisonment, a power not readily apparent from the text of § 3583(e)(3) (set out infra, at 8-9).

Johnson appealed his sentence, arguing that § 3583(e)(3) gave district courts no such power and that applying § 3583(h) to him violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 9. The Sixth Circuit, joining the majority of the Federal Courts of Appeals, had earlier taken Johnson's position as far as the interpretation of § 3583(e)(3) was concerned,  holding that it did not authorize a district court to impose a new term of supervised release following revocation and reimprisonment. See United States v. Truss, 4 F.3d 437 (CA6 1993). 2Of the 11 Circuits to consider the issue, 9 had reached this conclusion. See, e.g., United States v. Koehler, 973 F.2d 132 (CA2 1992); United States v. Malesic, 18 F.3d 205 (CA3 1994); United States v. Cooper, 962 F.2d 339 (CA4 1992); United States v. Holmes, 954 F.2d 270 (CA5 1992); United States v. Truss, 4 F.3d 437 (CA6 1993); United States v. McGee, 981 F.2d 271 (CA7 1992); United States v. Behnezhad, 907 F.2d 896 (CA9 1990); United States v. Rockwell, 984 F.2d 1112 (CA10 1993); United States v. Tatum, 998 F.2d 893 (CA11 1993). Two, the First and the Eighth, found that § 3583(e)(3) did grant district courts such power. See United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292 (CA1 1993); United States v. Schrader, 973 F.2d 623 (CA8 1992). It nonetheless affirmed the District Court, judgt. order reported at 181 F.3d 105 (1999), reasoning that the application of § 3583(h) was not retroactive at all, since revocation of supervised release was punishment for Johnson's violation of the conditions of supervised release,  which occurred after the 1994 amendments. With no retroactivity, there could be no Ex Post Facto Clause violation. See App. 49 (citing United States v. Abbington, 144 F.3d 1003, 1005 (CA6), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 933, 142 L. Ed. 2d 283, 119 S. Ct. 344 (1998)). Other Circuits had held to the contrary, that revocation and reimprisonment were punishment for the original offense. From that perspective, application of § 3583(h) was retroactive and at odds with the Ex Post Facto Clause. 3See, e.g., United States v. Eske, 189 F.3d 536, 539 (CA7 1999); United States v. Lominac, 144 F.3d 308, 312 (CA4 1998); United States v. Dozier, 119 F.3d 239, 241 (CA3 1997); United States v. Collins, 118 F.3d 1394, 1397 (CA9 1997); United States v. Meeks, 25 F.3d 1117, 1124 (CA2 1994) (addressing § 3583(g)). In contrast to these cases, the First and Eighth Circuits, relying on their broader construction of § 3583(e)(3), concluded that application of § 3583(h) did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. See United States v. Sandoval, 69 F.3d 531 (CA1 1995) (unpublished), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 821, 136 L. Ed. 2d 35, 117 S. Ct. 77 (1996); United States v. St. John, 92 F.3d 761 (CA8 1996). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflicts, 528 U.S. 590 (1999), and now affirm. 

II

The heart of the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 9, bars application of a law "that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed . . . ." Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798)  (emphasis deleted). To prevail on this sort of ex post facto claim, Johnson must show both that the law he challenges operates retroactively (that it applies to conduct completed before its enactment) and that it raises the penalty from whatever the law provided when he acted. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales,514 U.S. 499, 506-507, n. 3, 131 L. Ed. 2d 588, 115 S. Ct. 1597 (1995).

A

The Sixth Circuit, as mentioned earlier, disposed of the ex post facto challenge by applying its earlier cases holding the application of § 3583(h) not retroactive at all: revocation  of supervised release "imposes punishment for defendants' new offenses for violating the conditions of their supervised release." United States v. Page, 131 F.3d 1173, 1176 (1997). On this theory, that is, if the violation of the conditions of supervised release occurred after the enactment of § 3583(h), as Johnson's did, the new law could be given effect without applying it to events before its enactment.

 While this understanding of revocation of supervised release has some intuitive appeal, the Government  disavows it, and wisely so in view of the serious constitutional questions that would be raised by construing revocation and reimprisonment as punishment for the violation of the conditions of supervised release. Although such violations often lead to reimprisonment, the violative conduct need not be criminal and need only be found by a judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard, not by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Where the acts of violation are criminal in their own right, they may be the basis for separate prosecution, which would raise an issue of double jeopardy if the revocation of supervised release were also punishment for the same offense. Treating postrevocation sanctions as part of the penalty for the initial offense, however (as most courts have done), avoids these difficulties. See, e.g., United States v. Wyatt, 102 F.3d 241, 244-245 (CA7 1996) (rejecting double jeopardy challenge on ground that sanctions for violating the conditions of supervised release are part of the original sentence); United States v. Beals, 87 F.3d 854, 859-860 (CA7 1996) (noting that punishment for noncriminal violations must be justified by reference to original crimes), overruled on other grounds, United States v. Withers, 128 F.3d 1167 (1997); United States v. Meeks, 25 F.3d 1117, 1123 (CA2 1994) (noting absence of constitutional procedural protections in revocation proceedings). Cf.  Gagnon v. Scarpelli,411 U.S. 778, 782, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656, 93 S. Ct. 1756 (1973) ("Probation revocation . . . is not a stage of a criminal  prosecution"). For that matter, such treatment is all but entailed by our summary affirmance of Greenfield v. Scafati, 277 F. Supp. 644 (Mass. 1967) (three-judge court), summarily aff'd, 390 U.S. 713, 20 L. Ed. 2d 250, 88 S. Ct. 1409 (1968), in which a three-judge panel forbade on ex post facto grounds the application of a Massachusetts statute imposing sanctions for violation of parole to a prisoner originally sentenced before its enactment. We therefore attribute postrevocation penalties to the original conviction.

B

 Since postrevocation penalties relate to the original offense, to sentence Johnson to a further term of supervised release under § 3583(h) would be to apply this section retroactively (and to raise the remaining ex post facto question, whether that application makes him worse off). But before any such application (and constitutional test), there is a question that neither party addresses. The Ex Post Facto Clause raises to the constitutional level one of the most basic presumptions of our law: legislation, especially of the criminal sort, is not to be applied retroactively. See, e.g., Lynce v. Mathis,519 U.S. 433, 439, 137 L. Ed. 2d 63, 117 S. Ct. 891 (1997); Landgraf v. USI Film Products,511 U.S. 244, 265, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229, 114 S. Ct. 1483 (1994). Quite independent of the question whether the Ex Post Facto Clause bars retroactive application of § 3583(h), then, there is the question whether Congress intended such application. Absent a clear statement of that intent, we do not give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private interests. See id., at 270.

 The Government offers nothing indicating congressional intent to apply § 3583(h) retroactively. The  legislative decision to alter the rule of law established by the majority interpretation of § 3583(e)(3) (no authority for supervised release after revocation and reimprisonment) does not, by itself, tell us when or how that legislative decision was intended to take effect. SeeRivers v. Roadway Express, Inc.,511 U.S. 298, 304-307, 128 L. Ed. 2d 274, 114 S. Ct. 1510 (1994). Neither is there any indication of retroactive purpose in the omission of an express effective date from the statute. The omission simply remits us to the general rule that when a statute has no effective date, "absent a clear direction by Congress to the contrary, [it] takes effect on the date of its enactment." Gozlon-Peretz, 498 U.S. at 404. 4Indeed, the Sentencing Guidelines identify the effective date of § 3583(h) as September 13, 1994. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 7B1.3, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 1998) (USSG). So, too, have the federal courts. See, e.g., United States v. Hale, 107 F.3d 526, 529, n. 3 (CA7 1997).

Nor, finally, has Congress given us anything expressly identifying the relevant conduct in a way that would point to retroactive intent. It may well be that Congress, like the Sixth Circuit, believed that § 3583(h) would naturally govern sentencing proceedings for violations of supervised release that took place after the statute's enactment, simply because the violation was the occasion for imposing the sanctions. 5The failure to specify an effective date evidences at least arguable diffidence on this point. Another section of the same Act that added § 3583(h) amended 18 U.S.C. § 3553 to limit the applicability of some statutory minimum sentences. See § 80001, 108 Stat. 1985. That amendment, the section made explicit, "shall apply to all sentences imposed on or after the 10th day beginning after the date of enactment of this Act." § 80001(c), 108 Stat. 1986. But Congress gave us no clear indication to this effect, and we have already rejected that theory; the relevant conduct is the initial offense. In sum, there being no contrary intent, our longstanding presumption directs that § 3583(h) applies only to cases in which that initial offense occurred after the effective date of the amendment, September 13, 1994.

 Given this conclusion, the case does not turn on whether Johnson is worse off under § 3583(h) than he previously was under § 3583(e)(3), as subsection (h) does not apply, and the ex post facto question does not arise. The case turns, instead,  simply on whether § 3583(e)(3) permitted imposition of supervised release following a recommitment. 6We took a similar approach in Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group,508 U.S. 10, 123 L. Ed. 2d 572, 113 S. Ct. 1898 (1993). The respondents in that case were private developers who had entered into contracts with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. When the Department sought to recalibrate payments it owed under the contracts, the developers sued, and the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Department's proposed method of calculating payments was prohibited by the contracts. Congress subsequently passed legislation explicitly authorizing that method of calculation. The developers resisted application of that legislation to their contracts on the grounds that it retroactively deprived them of vested contractual rights, in violation of the Due Process Clause. We ruled (disagreeing with the Ninth Circuit's earlier holding) that the Department's methodology was acceptable under the contracts as signed. Finding the governmental action permitted by the old law, we declined to consider the constitutional consequences of a legislative attempt to change the applicable law.

 III

Section 3583(e), at the time of Johnson's conviction, authorized a district court to 

 "(1) terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the person released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the person released and the interest of justice;

"(2) extend a term of supervised release if less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed, and . . . modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision; 

 "(3) revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for the time previously served on postrelease supervision, if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person violated a condition of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that are applicable to probation revocation and to the provisions of applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission . . . ."

The text of subsection (e)(3) does not speak directly to the question whether a district court revoking a term of supervised release in favor of reimprisonment may require service of a further term of supervised release following the further incarceration. And if we were to concentrate exclusively on the verb "revoke," we would not detect any suggestion that the reincarceration might be followed by another term of supervised release, the conventional understanding of "revoke" being simply "to annul by recalling or taking back." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944 (1981). There are reasons, nonetheless, to think that the option of further supervised release was intended.

First, there are some textual reasons, starting with the preceding subsection (e)(1). This is an unequivocal provision for ending the term of supervised release without the possibility of its reimposition or continuation at a later time. Congress wrote that when a court finds that a defendant's conduct and the interests of justice warrant it, the court may "terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the person released," once at least a year of release time has been served. If application of subsection (3) had likewise been meant to conclude any possibility of supervised release later, it would have been natural for Congress to write in like terms. It could have provided that upon finding a defendant in violation of the release conditions the Court could "terminate a term of supervised release" and order the defendant  incarcerated for a term as long as the original supervised release term. But that is not what Congress did. Instead of using "terminate" with the sense of finality just illustrated in subsection (1), Congress used the verb "revoke" and so at the least left the door open to a reading of subsection (3) that would not preclude further  supervised release after the initial revocation. 7The dissent offers an erudite explanation of the different senses of the two words, intending to demonstrate that Congress displayed "an admirably precise use of language," by using "revoke" to mean "annul" and "terminate" to indicate that "[t]he supervised release is treated as fulfilled, and the sentence is complete." Post, at 3-4 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). That is virtuoso lexicography, but it shows only that English is rich enough to give even textualists room for creative readings. This one encounters serious difficulties; the very same section of the statute (as in effect at the time of Johnson's offense) provides that if the person released is found in possession of a controlled substance, "the court shall terminate the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release." 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g) (1988 ed.). In fact, the phrasing of subsection (3) did more than just leave the door open to the non-preclusive reading.

 As it was written before the 1994 amendments, subsection (3) did not provide (as it now does) that the court could revoke the release term and require service of a prison term equal to the maximum authorized length of a term of supervised release. It provided, rather, that the court could "revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release . . . ." So far as the text is concerned, it is not a "term of imprisonment" that is to be served, but all or part of "the term of supervised release." But if "the term of supervised release" is being served, in whole or part, in prison, then something about the term of supervised release survives the preceding order of revocation. While this sounds very metaphysical, the metaphysics make one thing clear: unlike a "terminated" order of supervised release, one  that is "revoked" continues to have some effect. And since it continues in some sense after revocation even when part of it is served in prison, why can the balance of it not remain effective as a term of supervised release when the reincarceration is over? 8JUSTICE SCALIA, post at 7, thinks the "term" survives only as a measure of duration, but of course the statute does not read "require the person to serve a term in prison equal to all or part of the term of supervised release . . . ."

 Without more, we would have to admit that Congress had used "revoke" in an unconventional way in subsection (3), but it turns out that the unconventional sense is not unheard of. See United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 295-296 (CA1 1993). Webster's Third New International Dictionary (our edition of which was issued three years before the 1984 Act) reveals that "revoke" can mean "to call or summon back," without the implication (here) that no further supervised release is subsequently possible. It gives "recall" as a synonym and comments that "RECALL in this sense indicates a calling back, suspending, or abrogating, either finally as erroneous or ill-advised or tentatively for deliberation . . . ." Ibid. 9While this sense is of course less common, the most recent editions of the most authoritative dictionaries do not tag it as rare or obsolete. The Oxford English Dictionary gives five examples of this usage, albeit hardly recent ones: three are drawn from the late 16th century and the most recent from 1784. 13 Oxford English Dictionary 838 (2d ed. 1989). But the OED is unabashedly antiquarian; of its examples for the more common meaning of "revoke," the most recent dates from 1873. Ibid. Webster's, it should be noted, includes the less common meaning, without antiquarian reproach, in its third edition. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1944 (1981).As JUSTICE SCALIA remarks, in relying on an uncommon sense of the word, we are departing from the rule of construction that prefers ordinary meaning, see post, at 1. But this is exactly what ought to happen when the ordinary meaning fails to fit the text and when the realization of clear congressional policy (here, favoring the ability to impose supervised release) is in tension with the result that customary interpretive rules would deliver. See, e.g., Commissioner v. Brown,380 U.S. 563, 571, 14 L. Ed. 2d 75, 85 S. Ct. 1162 (1965) (recognizing "some 'scope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning . . . would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute'") (quoting Helvering v. Hammel,311 U.S. 504, 510-511, 85 L. Ed. 303, 61 S. Ct. 368 (1941); In re Chapman,166 U.S. 661, 667, 41 L. Ed. 1154, 17 S. Ct. 677 (1897) ("[N]othing is better settled, than that statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion"). When text implies that a word is used in a secondary sense and clear legislative purpose is at stake, JUSTICE SCALIA's cocktail-party textualism, post, at 4, must yield to the Congress of the United States. (Not that we consider usage at a cocktail party a very sound general criterion of statutory meaning: a few nips from the flask might actually explain the solecism of the dissent's gunner who "revoked" his bird dog, post, at 6, n. 4; in sober moments he would know that dogs cannot be revoked, even though sentencing orders can be. His mistake, in any case, tells us nothing about how Congress may have used "revoke" in the statute. The gunner's error is, as JUSTICE SCALIA notes, one of current usage. (It is not merely that we do not "revoke" dogs in a "literal" sense today, as JUSTICE SCALIA puts it; we do not revoke them at all.) The question before us, however, is one of definition as distinct from usage: when Congress employed the modern usage in providing that a term of supervised release could be revoked, was it employing the most modern meaning of the term "revoke"? Usage can be a guide but not a master in answering a question of meaning like this one. JUSTICE SCALIA's argument from the current unacceptability of the dog and ox examples thus jeopardizes sound statutory construction rather more severely than his sportsman ever threatened a bird.) The unconventional dictionary definition is not, of  course, dispositive (although  the emphasis placed upon it by JUSTICE SCALIA might suggest otherwise, see post., at 4-5). What it does do, however, is to soften the strangeness of Congress's unconventional sense of "revoke" as allowing a "revoked" term of supervised release to retain vitality after revocation. It shows that saying a "revoked" term of supervised release survives to be served in prison following the court's reconsideration of it is consistent with a secondary but recognized definition, and so is saying that any balance not served in prison may survive to be served out as supervised release. 

 A final textually based point is that the result of recognizing Congress's unconventional usage of "revoke" is far less remarkable even than the unconventional usage. Let us suppose that Congress had legislated in language that unequivocally  supported the dissent, by writing subsection (3) to provide that the judge could "revoke" or "terminate" the term of supervised release and sentence the defendant to a further term of incarceration. There is no reason to think that under that regime the court would lack the power to impose a subsequent term of supervised release in accordance with its general sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(a). This section provides that "[t]he court, in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or a misdemeanor, may include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment . . . ." Thus, on the dissent's reading, when Johnson's supervised release was revoked and he was committed to prison, the District Court "impos[ed] a sentence to a term of imprisonment." See, e.g.,  App. 36, 39. And that sentence was, as already noted, imposed for his initial offense, the Class D felony violation of § 1029(b)(2). See supra, at 4-6. Nor would it be mere formalism to link the second prison sentence to the initial offense; the gravity of the initial offense determines the maximum term of reimprisonment, see § 3583(e)(3), just as it controls the maximum term of supervised release in the initial sentencing, see § 3583(b). Since on the dissent's understanding the resentencing proceeding would fall literally and sensibly within the terms of § 3583(a), a plain meaning approach would find authority for reimposition of supervised release there. Cf.  United States v. Wesley, 81 F.3d 482, 483-484 (CA4 1996) (finding that § 3583(a) grants power to impose a term of supervised release following reimprisonment at resentencing for violation of probation).

There is, then, nothing surprising about the consequences of our reading. The reading also enjoys the virtue of serving the evident congressional purpose. The congressional policy in providing for a term of supervised release after incarceration is to improve the odds of a successful transition  from the prison to liberty. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S.   ,     (2000) (slip op., at 6) ("Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in their transition to community life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration."). The Senate Report was quite explicit about this, stating that the goal of supervised release is "to ease the defendant's transition into the community after the service of a long prison term for a particularly serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short period in prison for punishment or other purposes but still needs supervision and training programs after release." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 124 (1983).

 Prisoners may, of course, vary in the degree of help needed for successful reintegration. Supervised release departed from the parole system it replaced by giving district courts the freedom to provide post-release supervision for those, and only those, who needed it. See id., at 125 ("In effect, the term of supervised release provided by the bill takes the place of parole supervision under current law. Unlike current law, however,  probation officers will only be supervising those releasees from prison who actually need supervision, and every releasee who does need supervision will receive it"). Congress aimed, then, to use the district courts' discretionary judgment to allocate supervision to those releasees who needed it most. But forbidding the reimposition of supervised release after revocation and reimprisonment would be fundamentally contrary to that scheme. A violation of the terms of supervised release tends to confirm the judgment that help was necessary, and if any prisoner might profit from the decompression stage of supervised release, no prisoner needs it more than one who has already tried liberty and failed. He is the problem case among problem cases, and a Congress asserting that "every releasee who does need supervision will receive it," ibid., seems very unlikely  to have meant to compel the courts  to wash their hands of the worst cases at the end of reimprisonment. 10JUSTICE SCALIA attributes the strong preference for supervised release at the conclusion of a prison term to this Court, post, at 10, when that view of penal policy comes not from the Court but from Congress. The point is crucial. Our obligation is to give effect to congressional purpose so long as the congressional language does not itself bar that result. See, e.g., Holloway v. United States, 526 U.S. 1, 9, 143 L. Ed. 2d 1, 119 S. Ct. 966 (1999) (noting that statutory language should be interpreted in light of congressional policy); Caron v. United States, 524 U.S. 308, 315, 141 L. Ed. 2d 303, 118 S. Ct. 2007 (1998) (rejecting petitioner's reading of a statute because it "yields results contrary to a likely, and rational, congressional policy"). One who believes that courts must not look beyond text might well find any invocation of policy unjustified (even willful), at least when the policy does not rise unbidden from the words of the statute, but we have never treated the text as such a jealous guide and have traditionally sought to construe a statute so as to reach results consistent with what Chief Justice Taney called "its object and policy." See United States v. Heirs of Boisdore,49 U.S. 113, 8 HOW 113, 122, 12 L. Ed. 1009 (1849). And in what Chief Justice Marshall called the attempt "to discover the design of the legislature," we have "seize[d] every thing from which aid can be derived." United States v. Fisher,6 U.S. 358, 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L. Ed. 304 (1805).

 The idea that a sentencing court should have authority to subject a reincarcerated prisoner to further supervised release has support, moreover, in the pre-Guidelines practice with respect to nondetentive monitoring, as illuminated in United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292 (CA1 1993). The Sentencing Guidelines, after all, "represent an approach that begins with, and builds upon," pre-Guidelines law, see USSG, ch. 1, pt. A, intro. comment. 3, and when a new legal regime develops out of an identifiable predecessor, it is reasonable to look to the pre-cursor in fathoming the new law. Cf.  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,480 U.S. 421, 432-434 (1987) (examining practice under precursor statute to determine meaning of amended statute).

Two sorts of nondetentive monitoring existed before the introduction of supervised release: probation and parole. Of these pre-Guidelines options, the one more closely analogous  to supervised release following imprisonment was parole, which by definition was a release under supervision of a parole officer following service of some term of incarceration. Courts have commented on the similarity. See, e.g., Meeks, 25 F.3d at 1121 ("[S]upervised release is essentially similar to parole"); United States v. Paskow, 11 F.3d 873, 881 (CA9 1993) ("Supervised release and parole are virtually identical systems").

In thinking about this case, it is striking that the provisions of the former parole scheme dealing with the consequences of violating parole conditions repeatedly used the verb "revoke." See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 4214(d)(5) (1982 ed.)(repealed 1984, Pub. L. 98-473, §§ 218(a)(5), 235, 98 Stat. 2027, 2031) (revocation of parole); 21 U.S.C. § 841(c) (1982 ed.) (repealed 1984) (revocation of special parole). And yet there seems never to have been a question that a new term of parole could follow a prison sentence imposed after revocation of an initial parole term. 11The same is true of special parole, part of the required sentence for certain drug offenses. Though the special parole statute did not explicitly authorize reimposition of special parole after revocation of the initial term and reimprisonment, the Parole Commission required it. See 28 CFR § 2.57(c) (1999). Some courts have recently decided that this regulation is inconsistent with 21 U.S.C. § 841(c) (1982 ed.), see, e.g., Evans v. United States Parole Comm'n, 78 F.3d 262 (CA7 1996), but this does not affect the backdrop against which Congress legislated in 1984.As for probation, the sentencing court's power to order a new term following revocation was the subject of some disagreement. The pre-Guidelines statute authorized the court to "revoke the probation and . . . impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed." 18 U.S.C. § 3653 (1982 ed.)(repealed). The statute thus clearly specified that the options for post-revocation sentencing were those available at the original sentencing; courts disputed only whether probation was a "sentence" that could be imposed. See O'Neil, 11 F.3d at 298-299 (collecting cases). The dispute over what counted as a sentence does not affect the broader point that a court's powers at the original sentencing are the baseline from which powers at resentencing are determined. Nor is our analysis of supervised release drawn into question by the fact that courts could not, for violations of probation, impose imprisonment followed by probation. Probation, unlike supervised release, was an alternative to imprisonment. Courts did not have the power to impose both at the original sentencing, so their inability to do so at subsequent sentencings is no surprise. See, e.g., 28 CFR § 2.52(b)  (1999) (following revocation of parole, Sentencing  Commission will determine whether reparole is warranted); O'Neil, supra, at 299; United States Parole Comm'n v. Williams, 311 U.S. App. D.C. 416, 54 F.3d 820, 824 (CADC 1995) (noting "the established pre-Guidelines sentencing principle that parole is available unless expressly precluded" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).12The dissent seems to misconstrue our discussion of pre-Guidelines practice, see post, at 11-12, claiming that the practice is unilluminating because the possibility of parole inhered in any prison sentence. But our point simply is that, metaphysics aside, Congress gave no indication that it thought supervised release after reincarceration would be less valuable than reparole after reincarceration had been. Thus, "revocation" of parole followed by further imprisonment was not a mere termination of a limited liberty that a defendant could experience only once per conviction, and it is fair to suppose that in the absence of any textual bar "revocation" of parole's replacement, supervised release, was meant to leave open the possibility of further supervised release, as well. 

 As seen already, "revoke" is no such bar, and we find no other. The proceeding that follows a violation of the conditions of supervised release is not, to be sure, a precise reenactment of the initial sentencing. Section 3583(e)(3) limits the possible prison term to the duration of the term of supervised release originally imposed. (If less than the maximum has been imposed, a court presumably may, before revoking the term, extend it pursuant to § 3583(e)(2); this would allow the term of imprisonment to equal the term of supervised release authorized for the initial offense.) The new prison term is limited further according to the gravity of the original offense. See § 3583(e)(3).  But nothing in these specific  provisions suggests that the possibility of supervised release following imprisonment was meant to be eliminated. 13Nor does our traditional rule of lenity in interpreting criminal statutes demand a contrary result. Lenity applies only when the equipoise of competing reasons cannot otherwise be resolved (not the case here), and in any event the rule of lenity would be Delphic in this case. There is simply no way to tell whether sentencing courts given the option of supervised release will generally be more or less lenient in fixing the second prison sentence.

 In sum, from a purely textual perspective, the more plausible reading of § 3583(e)(3) before its amendment and the addition of subsection (h) leaves open the possibility of supervised release after reincarceration. Pre-Guidelines practice, linguistic continuity from the old  scheme to the current one, and the obvious thrust of congressional sentencing policy confirm that, in applying the law as before the enactment of subsection (h), district courts have the authority to order terms of supervised release following reimprisonment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is

Affirmed.  


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

The federal bribery statute prohibits defrauding organizations which "receiv[e], in any one year period, benefits in excess of $ 10,000 under a Federal program." 18 U.S.C. § 666(b). We granted certiorari to determine whether the statute covers fraud perpetrated on organizations participating in the Medicare program. Upon consideration of the role and regulated status of hospitals as health care providers under the Medicare program, we hold they receive "benefits" within the meaning of the statute. We affirm petitioner's convictions.

I

Petitioner Jeffrey Allan Fischer was president and partial owner of Quality Medical Consultants, Inc. (QMC), a corporation  which performed billing audits for health care organizations. In 1993 petitioner, on QMC's behalf, negotiated a $ 1.2 million loan from West Volusia Hospital Authority (WVHA), a municipal agency responsible for operating two hospitals located in West Volusia County, Florida. Both hospitals participate in the Medicare program, and in 1993 WVHA received between $ 10 and $ 15 million in Medicare funds. 

 A February 1994 audit of WVHA's financial affairs raised questions about the QMC loan. An investigation revealed QMC used the loan proceeds to repay creditors and to raise the salaries of its five owner-employees, including petitioner. It was determined that petitioner had arranged for QMC to advance at least $ 100,000 to a private company owned by an individual who had assisted QMC in securing a letter of credit in connection with the WVHA loan. QMC, at petitioner's directive, also committed portions of the loan proceeds to speculative securities. These investments yielded losses of almost $ 400,000. The investigation further uncovered use of the loan proceeds to pay, through an intermediate transfer, a $ 10,000 kickback to WVHA's chief financial officer, the individual with whom petitioner had negotiated the loan in the first instance. QMC defaulted on its obligation to WVHA and filed for bankruptcy.

In 1996 petitioner was indicted by a federal grand jury on 13 counts, including charges of defrauding an organization which receives benefits under a federal assistance program, 18 U.S.C. § 666(a)(1)(A), and of paying a kickback to one of its agents, § 666(a)(2). A jury convicted petitioner on all counts charged, and the District Court sentenced him to 65 months' imprisonment and a 3-year term of supervised release. Petitioner, in addition, was ordered to pay $ 1.2 million in restitution.

On appeal petitioner argued that the Government failed to prove WVHA, as the organization affected by his wrongdoing, received "benefits in excess of $ 10,000 under a Federal program," as required by 18 U.S.C. § 666(b). Rejecting the  argument, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the convictions.  168 F.3d 1273 (1999). It held that funds received by an organization constitute "benefits" within the meaning of § 666(b) if the source of the funds is a federal program, like Medicare, which provides aid or assistance to participating organizations.  168 F.3d at 1276-1277. Entities receiving federal funding under ordinary commercial contracts, the court stated, fall outside the statute's coverage. Ibid. (citing and discussing United States v. Copeland, 143 F.3d 1439 (CA11 1998) (holding that federal funds received under a contract to construct military aircraft did not constitute "benefits" within the meaning of § 666(b))). The court added that its construction furthered "the statute's purpose of protecting from fraud, theft, and undue influence by bribery the money distributed to health care providers, and WVHA in particular, through the federal Medicare program and other similar federal assistance programs." 168 F.3d at 1277. It rejected the view that the Medicare program provides benefits only to its "targeted recipients," the qualifying patients. 168 F.3d at 1278 (disagreeing with United States v. LaHue, 998 F. Supp. 1182 (Kan. 1998), aff'd, 170 F.3d 1026 (CA10 1999)).

We granted certiorari, 528 U.S.     (1999), and we affirm.

A

The nature and purposes of the Medicare program give us essential instruction in resolving the present controversy. Established in 1965 as part of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. III), Medicare is a federally funded medical insurance program for the elderly and disabled. In fiscal 1997 some 38.8 million individuals were enrolled in the program, and over 6,100 hospitals were authorized to provide services to them. U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, 1998 Data Compendium 45, 75 (Aug. 1998). Medicare  expenditures for hospital services exceeded $ 123 billion in 1998, making the Federal Government the single largest source of funds for participating hospitals. See Cowen et al., National Health Care Financing Review 165, 208 (Winter 1999) (Table II). This amount constituted 32% of the hospitals' total receipts. Ibid.

Providers of health care services, such as the two hospitals operated by WVHA, qualify to participate in the program upon satisfying a comprehensive series of statutory and regulatory requirements, including particular accreditation standards. Hospitals, for instance, must satisfy licensing standards, 42 CFR § 482.11 (1999); possess a governing body to "ensure that there is an effective, hospital-wide quality assurance program to evaluate the provision of patient care," § 482.21; and employ a "well organized" medical staff accountable on matters relating to "the quality of the medical care provided to patients," § 482.22(b). Medicare's implementing regulations also require hospitals, among many other standards, to maintain and provide 24-hour nursing services, § 482.23; complete medical record services, § 482.24; "pharmaceutical services that meet the needs of the patients," § 482.25; and organized dietary services staffed with qualified personnel, § 482.28. The regulations go further, requiring hospital facilities to "be constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of the patient, and to provide facilities  for diagnosis and treatment and for special hospital services appropriate to the needs of the community." § 482.41. Compliance with these standards provides the Government with assurance that participating providers possess the capacity to fulfill their statutory obligation of providing "medically necessary" services "of a quality which meets professionally recognized standards of health care." 42 U.S.C. § 1320c-5(a). Peer review organizations monitor providers' compliance with these and other obligations. § 1320c-3(a); 42 CFR § 466.71 (1999). Sanctions for noncompliance  include dismissal from the program.  42 U.S.C. § 1320c-5(b)(1).

Medicare attains its objectives through an elaborate funding structure. Participating health care organizations, in exchange for rendering services, receive federal funds on a periodic basis. §§ 1395g, 1395l. The amounts received reflect the "reasonable cost" of services rendered, defined as "the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals covered [by  the program]." § 1395x(v)(1)(A). Necessary costs are not limited to the immediate costs of an individual treatment procedure. Instead they are defined in broader terms: "Necessary and proper costs are costs that are appropriate and helpful in developing and maintaining the operation of patient care facilities and activities." 42 CFR § 413.9(b)(2) (1999). Allowable costs include amounts which enhance the organization's capacity to provide ongoing, quality services not only to eligible patients but also to the community at large. By way of example, amounts incurred for "certain educational programs for interns and residents, known as [graduate medical education] programs, are 'allowable cost[s]' for which a hospital (a provider) may receive reimbursement." Regions Hospital v. Shalala,522 U.S. 448, 452, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895, 118 S. Ct. 909 (1998) (citing 42 CFR § 413.85(a) (1996)); see also § 413.85(b) (1999); Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,512 U.S. 504, 507-508, 129 L. Ed. 2d 405, 114 S. Ct. 2381 (1994) (describing regulation of education programs). "These programs," the Medicare regulations explain, "contribute to the quality of patient care within an institution and are necessary to meet the community's needs for medical and paramedical personnel. . . . [M]any communities have not assumed responsibility for financing these programs and it is necessary that support be provided by those purchasing healthcare. Until communities undertake to bear these costs, the program will participate appropriately in the support of these activities." 42 CFR § 413.85(c) (1999). Medicare also permits, indeed encourages, these providers to deposit the amounts of reimbursements  received for depreciation costs and other cash into sinking funds called "funded depreciation accounts." § 413.134(e). Investment income earned on these funds does not operate to reduce a provider's interest expense, § 413.153(b)(2)(iii), creating incentives to maintain modern medical equipment and facilities.

The Medicare regulations, furthermore, afford certain provider organizations "special treatment," intended to ensure the ongoing availability of medical services for qualifying patients. See 42 CFR pt. 412G (1999). Providers qualifying as "Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals," for instance, are entitled to additional, "lump sum" payments to compensate for significant declines in demand for patient care. § 412.108. The additional funds enable a provider to "maintai[n] [its] necessary core staff and services" and to satisfy its "fixed (and semi-fixed) costs." §§ 412.108(d)(3)(A), (B). So too does the Medicare program authorize "special treatment" for, among other providers, "sole community hospitals," "renal transplantation centers," and "hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients." See §§ 412.92, 412.100, 412.106. The subsidies assist providers in satisfying those financial obligations necessary to continue as going concerns in accordance with the program's requirements. See, e.g., § 412.92(d)(2). In the normal course Medicare disbursements occur on a periodic basis, often in advance of a provider's rendering services, 42 U.S.C. § 1395g(a); 42 CFR §§ 413.60, 413.64 (1999). The payment system serves to "protect providers' liquidity," Good Samaritan Hospital v. Shalala,508 U.S. 402, 406, 124 L. Ed. 2d 368, 113 S. Ct. 2151 (1993), thereby assisting in the ongoing provision of services.  42 CFR § 413.5(b)(1) (1999) (requiring reimbursement method to "result in current payment so that institutions will not be disadvantaged, as they sometimes are under other arrangements, by having to put up money for the purchase of goods and services well before they receive reimbursement"); § 413.5(b)(6) (reimbursement system must operate  under "recognition of the need of hospitals and other providers to keep pace with growing needs and to make improvements"). The program, then, establishes correlating and reinforcing incentives: The Government has an interest in making available a high level of quality of care for the elderly and disabled; and providers, because of their financial dependence upon the program, have incentives to achieve program goals. The nature of the program bears on the question of statutory coverage.

B

Section 666 of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibits acts of theft and fraud against organizations receiving funds under federal assistance programs. The statute in relevant part provides as follows:

 "(a) Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section exists --

"(1) being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof --

"(A) embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies, property that --

"(i) is valued at $ 5,000 or more, and

"(ii) is owned by, or is under the care, custody, or control of such organization, government, or agency; or

"(B) corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $ 5,000 or more; or

 "(2) corruptly gives, offers, or agrees to give anything of value to any person, with intent to influence or reward  an agent of an organization or of a State, local or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof, in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such organization, government, or agency involving anything of value of $ 5,000 or more;

"shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.

"(b) The circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that the organization, government, or agency receives, in any one year period, benefits in excess of $ 10,000 under a Federal program involving a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance.

"(c) This section does not apply to bona fide salary, wages, fees, or  other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business."

Liability for the acts prohibited by subsection (a) is predicated upon a showing that the defrauded organization "receive[d], in any one period, benefits in excess of $ 10,000 under a Federal program." § 666(b). Those benefits can be in the form of "a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." Ibid. All agree Medicare is a federal assistance program, see 42 CFR § 400.200 (1999), and that WVHA, as the organization defrauded by petitioner's actions, received in excess of $ 10,000 in payments under the program. The sole point in contention is whether those payments constituted "benefits," within the meaning of subsection (b).

Petitioner argues that the Medicare program provides benefits to the elderly and disabled but not to the health care organizations. Provider organizations, in petitioner's view, do no more than render services in exchange for compensation. Under petitioner's submission the Medicare program envisions a single beneficiary, the qualifying patient. The Government, in opposition, urges that a determination  whether an organization receives "benefits" within the meaning of § 666(b) turns on whether the Federal Government was the source of the payment. Funds received under a federal assistance program, the Government asserts, can be traced from federal coffers, often through an intermediary or carrier, to the health care provider. Under its view, the "federal-program source of the funds" satisfies the benefits definition. Brief for United States 11.

We reject petitioner's reading of the statute but without endorsing the Government's broader position. We conclude Medicare payments are "benefits," as the term is used in its ordinary sense and as it is intended in the statute. The noun "benefit" means "something that guards, aids, or promotes well-being: advantage, good"; "useful aid"; "payment, gift [such as] financial help in time of sickness, old age, or unemployment"; or "a cash payment or service provided for under an annuity, pension plan, or insurance policy." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 204 (1971). These definitions support petitioner's assertion that qualifying patients receive benefits under the Medicare program. It is commonplace for individuals to refer to their retirement or health plans as "benefits." So it ought not to be disputed that the elderly and disabled rank as the primary beneficiaries of the Medicare program. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395c, 1395j; 42 CFR § 400.202 (1999) (defining "beneficiary" as the "person who is entitled to Medicare benefits"); Shalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,514 U.S. 87, 91, 131 L. Ed. 2d 106, 115 S. Ct. 1232 (1995) ("Under the Medicare reimbursement scheme . . . participating hospitals furnish services to program beneficiaries and are reimbursed by the Secretary through fiscal intermediaries"); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U.S. at 404 (same). 

 That one beneficiary of an assistance program can be identified does not foreclose the existence of others, however. In this respect petitioner's construction would give incomplete meaning to the term "benefits." Medicare operates with a purpose and design above and beyond point-of-sale  patient  care, and it follows that the benefits of the program extend in a broader manner as well. The argument limiting the term "benefits" to the program's targeted or primary beneficiaries would exclude, for example, a Medicare intermediary (such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield), a result both parties disavow. For present purposes it cannot be disputed the providers themselves derive significant advantage by satisfying the participation standards imposed by the Government. These advantages constitute benefits within the meaning of the federal bribery statute, a statute we have described as "expansive," "both as to the [conduct] forbidden and the entities covered." Salinas v. United States,522 U.S. 52, 56, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352, 118 S. Ct. 469 (1997).

Subsection (b) identifies several sources as providing benefits under a federal program -- "a grant, contract, subsidy, loan, guarantee, insurance, or other form of Federal assistance." 18 U.S.C. § 666(b). This language indicates that Congress viewed many federal assistance programs as providing benefits to participating organizations. Coupled with the broad substantive prohibitions of subsection (a), the language of subsection (b) reveals Congress' expansive, unambiguous intent to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.

Subsection (c) of the statute bears on the analysis. The provision removes from the statute's coverage any "bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business." § 666(c). Petitioner argues that the subsection operates to exclude the payments in question because they are either "compensation" or "expenses paid or reimbursed," or some combination of the two, and that the payments are made in the "usual course of business." We disagree.

 The subsection provides that the specified sorts of payments are not ones to which the section applies. One inference from this formulation is that the described payments would have been benefits but for the subsection (c) exemption.  We need not go so far. Even assuming the examples of subsection (c) bear upon the definition of benefits, statutory examples of nonapplicability do not necessarily give rise to the inference that absent the enumeration the statute would otherwise apply. To define all subsection (c) payments as exempted benefits would go well beyond the ordinary meaning of the word. On the other hand, the statute is not written to say "The term 'benefits' does not include bona fide salary, wages, fees, or other compensation paid, or expenses paid or reimbursed, in the usual course of business." We must construe the term "benefits," then, in a manner consistent with Congress' intent not to reach the enumerated class of transactions. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 370 (1984) (stating that "not every Federal contract or disbursement of funds would be covered [under § 666]. For example, if a government agency lawfully purchases more than $ 10,000 in equipment from a supplier, it is not the intent of this section to make a theft of $ 5,000 or more from the supplier a Federal crime").

 We do not accept the view that the Medicare payments here in question are for the limited purposes of compensating providers or reimbursing them for ordinary course expenditures.  The payments are made for significant and substantial reasons in addition to compensation or reimbursement, so that neither these terms nor the usual course of business conditions set forth in subsection (c) are met here. The payments in question have attributes and purposes well beyond those described in subsection (c). These attributes and purposes are consistent with the definition of "benefit." While the payments might have similarities to payments an insurer would remit to a hospital quite without regard to the Medicare program, the Government does not make the payment unless the hospital complies with its intricate regulatory scheme. The payments are made not simply to reimburse for treatment of qualifying patients but to assist the hospital in making available and maintaining a certain level and quality  of medical care, all in the interest of both the hospital and the greater community.

Here, as we have explained, the provider itself is the object of substantial Government regulation. Medicare is designed to the end that the Government receives not only reciprocal value from isolated transactions but also long-term advantages from the existence of a sound and effective health care system for the elderly and disabled. The Government enacted specific statutes and regulations to secure its own interests in promoting the well being and advantage of the health care provider, in addition to the patient who receives care. The health care provider is receiving a benefit in the conventional sense of the term, unlike the case of a contractor whom the Government does not regulate or assist for long-term objectives or for significant purposes beyond performance of an immediate transaction. Adequate payment and assistance to the health care provider is itself one of the objectives of the program. These purposes and effects suffice to make the payment a benefit within the meaning of the statute.

The structure and operation of the Medicare program reveal a comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimed at ensuring the availability of quality health care for the broader community. Participating health care organizations, as our above discussion shows, must satisfy a series of qualification and accreditation requirements, standards aimed in part at ensuring the provision of a certain quality of care. See 42 CFR pt. 482 (1999). By reimbursing participating providers for a wide range of costs and expenses, including medical treatment costs, overhead costs, and education costs, Medicare's reimbursement system furthers this objective. This scheme is structured to ensure that providers possess the capacity to render, on an ongoing basis, medical care to the program's qualifying patients. The structure, moreover, proves untenable petitioner's assertion that Congress has no interest in the financial stability of providers  once services are rendered to patients. Payments are made in a manner calculated to maintain provider stability. § 413.5(b); Good Samaritan Hospital, 508 U.S. at 406. Incentives are given for long-term improvements, such as capital costs and education. §§ 413.85, 413.134(e), 413.153(b)(2)(iii). Subsidies, defined as "special treatment," are awarded to certain providers. Id., pt. 412G. In short, provider organizations play a vital role and maintain a high level of responsibility in carrying out the  program's purposes. Medicare funds, in turn, provide benefits extending beyond isolated, point-of-sale treatment transactions. The funds health care organizations receive for participating in the Medicare program constitute "benefits" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 666(b).

 Our discussion should not be taken to suggest that federal funds disbursed under an assistance program will result in coverage of all recipient fraud under § 666(b). Any receipt of federal funds can, at some level of generality,  be characterized as a benefit. The statute does not employ this broad, almost limitless use of the term. Doing so would turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense, upsetting the proper federal balance. To determine whether an organization participating in a federal assistance program receives "benefits," an examination must be undertaken of the program's structure, operation, and purpose. The inquiry should examine the conditions under which the organization receives the federal payments. The answer could depend, as it does here, on whether the recipient's own operations are one of the reasons for maintaining the program. Health care organizations participating in the Medicare program satisfy this standard.

 The Government has a legitimate and significant interest in prohibiting financial fraud or acts of bribery being perpetrated upon Medicare providers. Fraudulent acts threaten the program's integrity. They raise the risk participating organizations will lack the resources requisite to provide the  level and quality of care envisioned by the program. Cf.  Salinas, 522 U.S. at 61 (stating that acceptance of bribes by an official of a jail housing federal prisoners pursuant to an agreement with the Government "was a threat to the integrity and proper operation of the federal program").

Other cases may present questions requiring further examination and elaboration of the term "benefits." Here it suffices to hold that health care providers such as the one defrauded by petitioner receive benefits within the meaning of the statute. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

 It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court. We granted certiorari in this case, 534 U.S. 1112, 151 L. Ed. 2d 883, 122 S. Ct. 918 (2002), to determine whether the Michigan Supreme Court erred in  holding that, under 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III),  only a State's "generic" fee is relevant to determining the fee that was "collected or charged as of November 15, 1991."

Beginning in 1965, Congress authorized States to require interstate motor carriers operating within their borders to register with the State proof of their Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) interstate operating permits. Pub. L. 89-170, 79 Stat. 648, 49 U.S.C. § 302(b)(2) (1970 ed.). Congress provided that state registration requirements would not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce so long as they were consistent with regulations promulgated by the ICC. Ibid.

 Prior to 1994, the ICC allowed States to charge interstate motor carriers annual registration fees of up to $ 10 per vehicle. See 49 CFR § 1023.33 (1992). As proof of registration, participating States would issue a stamp for each of the carrier's vehicles. § 1023.32. The stamp was affixed on a "uniform identification cab card" carried in each vehicle, within the square bearing the name of the issuing State. § 1023.32(d)-(e). This system came to be known as the "bingo card" system.  Single-State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C.2d 609 (1993).

The "bingo card" regime proved unsatisfactory to many who felt that the administrative burdens it placed on carriers and participating States outweighed the benefits to those States and to the public. H. R. Rep. No. 102-171 pt. I, p. 49 (1991), H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 102-404, pp. 437-438 (1991). In the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Congress therefore directed the ICC to implement a new system to replace the "bingo card" regime. *Congress abolished the ICC in 1995 and assigned responsibility for administering the new Single State Registration System to the Secretary of Transportation. See ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-88, § 101, 109 Stat. 803. The provisions of ISTEA governing the system were amended and recodified. See 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c). The Federal Highway Administration, under the Secretary of Transportation, adopted the ICC regulations that implemented the Single State Registration System, 61 Fed. Reg. 54706, 54707 (1996), and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration now has authority to administer the system, 49 U.S.C. § 113(f)(1). See Pub. L. 102-240, § 4005, 105 Stat. 1914, 49 U.S.C. § 11506(c) (1994 ed.). Under the new system, called the Single State Registration System, "a motor carrier  [would be] required to register annually with only one State," and "such single State registration [would] be deemed to satisfy the registration requirements of all other  States." §§ 11506(c)(1)(A) and (C). Thus, one State would -- on behalf of all other participating States -- register a carrier's vehicles, file and maintain paperwork, and collect and distribute registration fees. § 11506(c)(2)(A). Participation in the Single State Registration System was limited to those States that had elected to participate in the "bingo card" system. § 11506(c)(2)(D).

ISTEA also capped the per-vehicle registration fee that participating States could charge interstate motor carriers. Congress directed the ICC to

"establish a fee system . . . that (I) will be based on the number of commercial motor vehicles the carrier operates in a State and on the number of States in which the carrier operates, (II) will minimize the costs of complying with the registration system, and (III) will result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $ 10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991." § 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv).

Congress provided that the charging or collection of any fee not in accordance with the ICC's fee system would "be deemed to be a burden on interstate commerce." § 11506(c)(2)(C).

The ICC issued its final implementing regulations in May 1993 after notice-and-comment proceedings. Single-State Insurance Registration, supra. The rulemaking gave rise to the central question in this case: whether, under the Single State Registration System, States were free to terminate "reciprocity agreements" that were in place under the "bingo card" regime. Id., at 617-619. Under these agreements, in exchange for reciprocal treatment, some States discounted or waived registration fees for carriers from other States. Id., at 617.

In issuing a set of proposed rules and soliciting further comments, the ICC questioned whether it had the power to require States to preserve pre-existing reciprocity agreements.  Single State Insurance Registration, No. MC-100 (Sub-No. 6), Single State Insurance Registration, No. MC-100 (Sub-No. 6), 1993 WL 17833 *12 (Jan. 22, 1993), see Single State Insurance Registration -- 1993 Rules, 9 I.C.C. 2d 11, (1992). It noted that these agreements were voluntary and mutually beneficial and commented that "as long as no carrier is charged more than [a State's] standard November 15, 1991, fee for all carriers (subject to the $ 10 limit), the requirements of [ISTEA] are satisfied." 1993 WL 17833, *12.

In its final implementing regulations, however, the ICC concluded, in light of further comments, that its preliminary view on reciprocity agreements was inconsistent with ISTEA's fee-cap provision and with "the intent of the law that the flow of revenue for the States be maintained while the burden of the registration system for carriers be reduced." Single-State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C. 2d 609, 618 (1993). The agency therefore determined that States participating in the Single State Registration System "must consider fees charged or collected under reciprocity agreements when determining the fees charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, as required by § 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv)." Id., at 618-619; see also American Trucking Associations -- Petition for Declaratory Order -- Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C. 2d 1184, 1192, 1194-1195 (1993). The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and 18 state regulatory commissions sought review of the ICC's determination and certain provisions of the Single State Registration System regulations. National Ass'n of Regulatory Comm'rs v. ICC, 309 U.S. App. D.C. 325, 41 F.3d 721 (1994). The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia concluded that the plain language of the statute supported the ICC's determination that States participating in the new system must consider reciprocity agreements under 49 U.S.C. § 11506(c)(2)(B)(iv).  41 F.3d at 729.

Prior to the implementation of the Single State Registration System, Michigan had participated in the "bingo card" regime. See App. 5 (Affidavit of Thomas R. Lonergan, Director, Motor Carrier Regulation Division of the Michigan Public Service Commission at P3e) (hereinafter Lonergan Affidavit). The Michigan Legislature had directed the Michigan Public Service Commission to levy an annual registration fee of $ 10 per vehicle on interstate motor carrier vehicles and simultaneously endowed the commission with authority to "enter into a reciprocal agreement with a state." Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 478.7(4) (West 1988). Pursuant to such reciprocal agreements, the Commission was empowered to "waive the fee [otherwise] required." Ibid.

 Petitioner in this case is an interstate trucking company headquartered in Kansas. For calendar years 1990 and 1991, the Michigan Public Service Commission did not levy a fee for petitioner's trucks that were licensed in Illinois pursuant to its policy "not to charge a fee to carriers with vehicles registered in states . . . which did not charge Michigan-based carriers a fee." App. 5 (Lonergan Affidavit P3i). In 1991, however, the Michigan Public Service Commission announced a change in its reciprocity policy to take effect on February 1, 1992. Under the new policy, the commission granted reciprocity treatment based on the policies of the State in which a carrier maintained its principal place of  business rather than the State in which individual vehicles were licensed. Because Michigan had no reciprocal arrangement with Kansas, the Michigan Public Service Commission sent petitioner a bill in September 1991, levying a fee of $ 10 per vehicle for the 1992 registration year on petitioner's entire fleet, with payment due on January 1, 1992.

Petitioner paid the fees in October 1991 under protest and later brought suit in the Michigan Court of Claims seeking a refund of the fees it paid for its Illinois-licensed vehicles after the Single State Registration System came into effect. See 49 U.S.C. § 11506(c)(3) (1994 ed.) (setting effective date of January 1, 1994). Petitioner alleged that, because Michigan had not "collected or charged" a fee for the  1991 registration year for trucks licensed in Illinois, ISTEA's fee-cap provision prohibits Michigan from levying a fee on Illinois-licensed trucks.

On cross motions for summary disposition, the Michigan Court of Claims ruled in favor of petitioner. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Michigan, No. 95-15706-CM (Mar. 13, 1996) (Yellow Freight System I). The Court of Claims' holding relied on an ICC declaratory order in which the agency held that ISTEA's fee-cap provision caps fees at the level "collected or charged"  for registration year 1991, not those fees levied for registration year 1992 in advance of the statutory cut-off date. Id., at 3-4, see American Trucking Associations, 9 I.C.C. 2d at 1192, 1195.

The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed on similar grounds. Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Michigan, 231 Mich. App. 194, 585 N.W.2d 762 (1998) (Yellow Freight System II). The Court of Appeals also rejected Michigan's argument that States need not consider reciprocity agreements in determining the level of fees "charged or collected as of November 15, 1991," noting that the ICC had determined reciprocity agreements must be considered, and that the agency's decision had been upheld in National Ass'n of Regulatory Comm'rs v. ICC, 309 U.S. App. D.C. 325, 41 F.3d 721 (CADC 1994).Yellow Freight System II, 231 Mich. App. at 202-203, 585 N.W.2d at 766.

The Michigan Supreme Court reversed.  Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Michigan, 464 Mich. 21, 627 N.W.2d 236 (2001) (Yellow Freight SystemIII). The court concluded that "reciprocity agreements are not relevant in determining what fee [a State] 'charged or collected' as of November 15, 1991." Id., at 33, 627 N.W.2d at 242.The court expressly rejected the D. C. Circuit's contrary conclusion. Id., at 29, 627 N.W.2d at 240 (citing NARUCv. ICC, supra). The Court applied Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984), but determined that the statute unambiguously forbids the ICC's interpretation. Yellow Freight System III, 464 Mich. at 29-31, 627 N.W.2d at 240-241. Reasoning that "the new 'fee system' is based not on the fees collected from one individual company, but on the fee system that the state had in place on November 15, 1991," the court concluded that "we must look not at the fees paid by [petitioner] in any given year, but at the generic feeMichigan charged or collected from carriers as of November 15, 1991." Id., at 31, 627 N.W.2d at 241 (emphasis added). Two justices dissented, finding ISTEA's fee-cap provision ambiguous, the ICC's construction reasonable, and deference therefore due.  464 Mich. at 33-43, 627 N.W.2d at 242-247 (opinions of Kelly and Cavanagh, JJ.).

The Michigan Supreme Court did not consider respondents' argument that the fees petitioner paid Michigan for the 1992 registration year were "collected or charged as of November 15, 1991." 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). Nor did that court reach the question whether Michigan had "canceled its reciprocity agreements with other States in 1989." Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae 23. The only issue before this Court, therefore, is whether States may charge motor carrier registration fees in excess of those charged or collected under reciprocity agreements as of November 15, 1991.

  II

Neither party disputes that Chevron, supra, governs the interpretive task at hand. In ISTEA, Congress made an express delegation of authority to the ICC to promulgate standards for implementing the new Single State Registration System.  49 U.S.C. § 11506(c)(1) (1994 ed.). The ICC did so, interpreting ISTEA's fee-cap provision subsequent to a notice-and-comment rulemaking. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 229, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292, 121 S. Ct. 2164 (2001)("[A] very good indicator of delegation meriting Chevron treatment [is an] express congressional authorization to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed"). The Federal Highway Administration adopted the ICC's regulations, see n. 1, supra, and the Single State Registration System is now administered by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  49 U.S.C. § 113.

Accordingly, the question before us is whether the text of the statute resolves the issue, or, if not, whether the ICC's interpretation is permissible in light of the deference to be accorded the agency under the statutory scheme. If the statute speaks clearly "to the precise question at issue," we "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-843. If the statute is instead "silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue," we must sustain the agency's interpretation if it is "based on a permissible construction of the statute." Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, see Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 217-218, 152 L. Ed. 2d 330, 122 S. Ct. 1265 (2002).ISTEA's fee-cap provision does not foreclose the ICC's determination that fees charged under States' pre-existing reciprocity agreements were, in effect, frozen by the new Single State Registration System. The provision requires that the new system "result in a fee for each participating State that is equal to the fee, not to exceed $ 10 per vehicle, that such State collected or charged as of November 15, 1991." 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). The language "collected or  charged" can quite naturally be read to mean fees that a State actually collected or charged. The statute thus can easily be read as the ICC chose, making it unlawful "for a State to renounce or modify a reciprocity agreement so as to alter any fee charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, under the predecessor registration system." American Trucking Associations, 9 I.C.C. 2d at 1194, see Single-State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C. 2d 609, 618-619 (1993).

The Michigan Supreme Court held that the language of ISTEA's fee-cap provision compels a different result. Although it acknowledged that ISTEA is silent with respect to reciprocity agreements, the court nonetheless concluded that the fee-cap provision mandates that those agreements have no bearing in the determination of what fee a State "collected or charged" as of November 15, 1991. Yellow Freight System III, 464 Mich. at 31, 627 N.W.2d at 241. The court reasoned that the Single State Registration System was "based not on the fees collected from one individual company, but on the fee system that the state had in  place." Ibid. (emphasis added). While such a reading might be reasonable, nothing in the statute compels that particular result.

The fee-cap provision refers not to a "fee system," but to the "fee . . . collected or charged." 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III). Under the ICC's rule, where a State waives its registration fee, its "fee . . . collected or charged" is zero and must remain zero. The ICC's interpretation is a permissible reading of the language of the statute. And, because there is statutory ambiguity and the agency's interpretation is reasonable, its interpretation must receive deference. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.

As commenters to the ICC during the rulemaking pointed out, to allow States to disavow their reciprocity agreements so as to alter any fee charged or collected as of November 15, 1991, would potentially permit States to increase their revenues substantially under the new system, a result that the ICC quite reasonably believed Congress did not intend.  See Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C. 2d at 618. The ICC concluded that its rule best served the "intent of the law that the flow of revenue for the States be maintained while the burden of the registration system for carriers be reduced." Ibid. The agency considered that allowing States to disavow reciprocity agreements and charge a single, uniform fee might reduce administrative burdens, but expressed concern that carriers' registration costs, and state revenues, would balloon. Ibid. (noting that some carriers' fees "assertedly could increase as much as 900%," and that one commenter presented a "worst case scenario" in which "State revenues could increase from $ 50 million to $ 200 million").Respondents argue that Congress intended for each State to set a single, uniform fee. While such a mandate would, indeed, have simplified the new system, it is not compelled by the language of the statute, which instructs the ICC to implement a system under which States charge a fee, not to exceed $ 10 per vehicle, that is equal to the fee such States "collected or charged as of November 15, 1991."Respondents also contend that, by freezing the fees charged under reciprocity agreements as part of the fee cap, the ICC added a constraint not within the express language of the statute. The Michigan Supreme Court expressed a similar concern, stating that "it is not for the ICC . . . to insert words into the statute." 464 Mich. at 32, 627 N.W.2d at 241-242. It was precisely Congress' command, however, that the ICC promulgate standards to govern the Single State Registration System, 49 U.S.C. § 11506(c) (1994 ed.), and it was thus for that agency to resolve any ambiguities and fill in any holes in the statutory scheme. See Mead Corp., 533 U.S. at 229; Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-844. To hold States to the fees they actually collected or charged seems to us a reasonable interpretation of the statute's command that state fees be "equal to the fee, not to exceed $ 10 per  vehicle, that such State collected or  charged as of November 15, 1991." 49 U.S.C. § 14504(c)(2)(B)(iv)(III).

Respondents argue that the ICC's rule contravenes ISTEA's fee-cap provision by limiting what a State can charge based on what was collected from or charged to a particular carrier. Respondents point out that the focus of the provision is on the actions of the State, not the actions of any particular carrier. While we agree that the statute focuses on what States "collected or charged" rather than what particular carriers paid, we do not agree that the ICC's rule focuses the inquiry on the latter. Under the "bingo card" regime, States entered into reciprocity agreements that waived or reduced fees charged to particular categories of vehicles. The ICC's rule does not necessarily cap the aggregate fee paid by any particular carrier; rather, it simply requires States to preserve fees at the levels they actually collected or charged pursuant to reciprocity agreements in place as of November 15, 1991.Because the ICC's interpretation of ISTEA's fee-cap provision is consistent with the language of the statute and reasonably resolves any ambiguity therein, see Chevron, supra, at 843, the Michigan Supreme Court erred in declining to enforce it.

The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the Michigan Supreme Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

 We address in this case whether 23 U.S.C. § 409, which protects information "compiled or collected" in connection  with certain federal highway safety programs from being discovered or admitted in certain federal or state trials, is a valid exercise of Congress' authority under the Constitution.

I

A

Beginning with the Highway Safety Act of 1966, Congress has endeavored to improve the safety of our Nation's highways by encouraging closer federal and state cooperation with respect to road improvement projects. To that end, Congress has adopted several programs to assist the States in identifying highways in need of improvements and in funding those improvements. See, e.g., 23 U.S.C. §§ 130 (Railway-Highway Crossings), 144 (Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program), and 152 (Hazard Elimination Program). Of relevance to this case is the Hazard Elimination Program (Program) which provides state and local governments with funding to improve the most dangerous sections of their roads. To be eligible for funds under the Program, a state or local government must undertake a thorough evaluation of its public roads. Specifically, § 152(a)(1) requires them to

 "conduct and systematically maintain an engineering survey of all public roads to identify hazardous locations, sections, and elements, including roadside obstacles and unmarked or poorly marked roads, which may constitute a danger to motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, assign priorities for the correction of such locations, sections, and elements, and establish and implement a schedule of projects for their improvement."

Not long after the adoption of the Hazard Elimination Program, the Secretary of Transportation reported to Congress that the States objected to the absence of any confidentiality with respect to their compliance measures under § 152. H. R. Doc. No. 94-366, p. 36 (1976). According to the Secretary's report,  the States feared that diligent efforts to identify roads eligible for aid under the Program would increase the risk of liability for accidents that took place at hazardous locations before improvements could be made. Ibid. In 1983, concerned that the States' reluctance to be forthcoming and thorough in their data collection efforts undermined the Program's effectiveness, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) recommended the adoption of legislation prohibiting the disclosure of information compiled in connection with the Hazard Elimination Program. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Alabama Highway Dept. v. Boone, O. T. 1991, No. 90-1412, p. 10, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 937 (1991).

To address the concerns expressed by the States and the DOT, in 1987, Congress adopted 23 U.S.C. § 409, which provided:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data compiled for the purpose of identifying[,] evaluating, or planning the safety enhancement of potential accident sites, hazardous roadway conditions, or railway-highway crossings, pursuant to sections 130, 144, and 152 of this title or for the purpose of developing any highway  safety construction improvement project which may be implemented utilizing Federal-aid highway funds shall not be admitted into evidence in Federal or State court or considered for other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data." Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, § 132, 101 Stat. 170.

The proper scope of § 409 became the subject of some dispute among the lower courts. Some state courts, for example, concluded that § 409 addressed only the admissibility of relevant documents at trial and did not apply to pretrial discovery.  According to these courts, although information compiled for § 152 purposes would be inadmissible at trial, it nevertheless remained subject to discovery. See, e.g., Ex parte Alabama Highway Dep't, 572 So. 2d 389 (Ala. 1990), cert. denied sub nom.  Alabama Highway Dept. v. Boone, 502 U.S. 937 (1991); Light v. New York, 149 Misc. 2d 75, 80, 560 N.Y.S.2d 962, 965 (Ct. Cl. 1990);Indiana DOT, Div. of Railroads v. Overton, 555 N.E.2d 510, 512 (Ind. App. 1990). Other state courts reasoned that § 409 protected only materials actually generated by a governmental agency for § 152 purposes, and documents collected by that agency to prepare its § 152 funding application remained both admissible and discoverable. See, e.g., Wiedeman v. Dixie Elec. Membership Corp., 627 So. 2d 170, 173 (La. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1127 (1994). See also, e.g., Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Yarnell, 181 Ariz. 316, 319-320, 890 P.2d 611, 614-615, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 937 (1995) (applying the same rule in the context of the Railway-Highway Crossings program); Tardy v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 103 Ohio App. 3d 372, 378-379, 659 N.E.2d 817, 820-821 (same), appeal not allowed, 74 Ohio St. 3d 1408, 655 N.E.2d 187 (1995) (Table).

Responding to these developments, Congress amended § 409 in two ways. In 1991, Congress expressly made the statute applicable to pretrial discovery, see Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, § 1035(a), 105 Stat. 1978, and in 1995, Congress added the phrase "or collected" after the word "compiled," National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, § 323, 109 Stat. 591. As amended, § 409 now reads:

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data compiled or collected for the purpose of identifying, evaluating, or planning the safety enhancement of potential accident sites, hazardous roadway conditions, or railway-highway crossings, pursuant to sections 130, 144, and 152 of this title or for the purpose of developing any highway safety construction  improvement project which may be implemented utilizing Federal-aid highway funds shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State court proceeding or considered for other purposes in any action for damages arising from any occurrence at a location mentioned or addressed in such reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data."

Ignacio Guillen's wife, Clementina Guillen-Alejandre, died on July 5, 1996, in an automobile accident at the intersection of 168th Street East and B Street East (168/B intersection), in Pierce County, Washington. Several months before the accident, petitioner had requested § 152 funding for this intersection, but the request had been denied. Petitioner renewed its application for funding on April 3, 1996, and the second request was approved on July 26, 1996, only three weeks after the accident occurred.

 Beginning on August 16, 1996, counsel for respondents sought to obtain from petitioner information about accidents that  had occurred at the 168/B intersection. 1In a letter dated October 28, 1996, respondents' counsel clarified his request as follows: "'I want to make the record clear that we are not seeking any reports that were specifically written for developing any safety construction improvement project at the intersection at issue.'" Quoted in 144 Wn.2d 696, 703, 31 P.3d 628, 633 (2001). The letter further explained, however, that respondents were seeking "'a copy of all documents that record the accident history of the intersection that may have been used in the preparation of any such reports.'" Quoted in id., at 703-704, 31 P. 3d, at 633. Petitioner declined to provide any responsive information, asserting that any relevant documents were protected by § 409. After informal efforts failed to resolve this discovery dispute, respondents  turned to the Washington courts.

Respondents first filed an action alleging that petitioner's refusal to disclose the relevant documents violated the  State's Public Disclosure Act (PDA). 2The relevant portion of the PDA provides:"Upon the motion of any person having been denied an opportunity to inspect or copy a public record by an agency, the superior court in the county in which a record is maintained may require the responsible agency to show cause why it has refused to allow inspection or copying of a specific public record or class of records. The burden of proof shall be on the agency to establish that refusal to permit public inspection and copying is in accordance with a statute that exempts or prohibits disclosure in whole or in part of specific information or records." Wash. Rev. Code § 42.17.340(1) (2000). The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and ordered petitioner to disclose five documents 3The trial court's judgment encompassed the following materials: (1) a list of accidents at the 168/B intersection from 1990 through 1996, prepared by the Washington State Patrol, showing the location, date, time, and nature of the accident, which petitioner subsequently obtained for the purpose of conducting a study of the safety of the intersection; (2) a collision diagram dated January 5, 1989, prepared by a county employee responsible for investigating accidents at the intersection; (3) another collision diagram dated July 18, 1988, prepared by the same county employee; (4) reports of accidents at the intersection prepared by law enforcement agencies investigating the accidents; and (5) a draft memorandum from petitioner's public works director to a county council member, consisting of information used for petitioner's application for § 152 funds for the 168/B intersection. See 144 Wash. 2d, at 704-705, and n. 1; 31 P. 3d, at 634, and n. 1. and pay respondents' attorney's fees. Petitioner appealed.

 While the appeal in the PDA action was pending, respondents filed a separate action, asserting that petitioner had been negligent in failing to install proper traffic controls at the 168/B intersection. In connection with the tort action, respondents served petitioner with interrogatories seeking information regarding accidents that had occurred at the 168/B intersection. Petitioner refused to comply with the discovery request, once again relying on § 409. Respondents successfully sought an order to compel, and petitioner moved for discretionary appellate review of the trial judge's interlocutory order. The Washington Court of Appeals granted the motion and consolidated the appeal in the tort case with the appeal in the PDA action.

On review, the Washington Court of Appeals in large part affirmed the decisions below. In interpreting § 409, the court distinguished between an agency that collects or compiles information for purposes unrelated to § 152 and one that collects and compiles information pursuant to § 152. In the court's view, documents held by the first agency would not be protected by § 409, even if they subsequently were used for § 152 purposes, whereas documents held by the second agency would be protected, so long as their collection or compilation was the result of § 152 efforts. Applying these principles, the court concluded that only one of the documents at issue in the PDA case -- the draft memorandum by the county's public works director, see n. 3, supra -- was protected by § 409 because it had been prepared for § 152 purposes. The rest  were not because respondents "carefully requested reports in the hands of the sheriff or other law enforcement agencies, not reports or data 'collected or compiled' by the Public  Works Department." 96 Wn. App. 862, 873, 982 P.2d 123, 129 (1999). The appellate court also expressed doubt about the constitutionality of § 409 as applied in state courts, but decided not to resolve the question because it was not raised.  Id., at 875, n. 26, 982 P. 2d, at 130, n. 26. Petitioner appealed once again.

The Washington Supreme Court's decision followed a three-step analysis. The court first determined that disclosure of the information respondents sought under both the PDA and state discovery rules would be appropriate only if the materials requested by respondents were not protected by § 409.

Second, examining the scope of § 409, the Washington Supreme Court rejected, as "unsound in principle and unworkable in practice," 144 Wn. 2d 696, 727, 31 P. 3d 628, 646 (2001), the appellate court's view that § 409 drew a distinction between documents "as held by" the Public Works Department  and documents "as held by" the county sheriff. Rather, it reasoned that § 409, as amended in 1995, purported to protect from disclosure any documents prepared for state and local purposes, so long as those documents were also collected for § 152 purposes. In the court's view, the statute did not turn on the identity of the custodian of the document at issue.

Having so construed § 409, the court proceeded to consider whether the adoption of the 1995 amendment to § 409 was a proper exercise of Congress' powers under the Spending, Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses of Article I of the United States Constitution. With respect to the Spending Clause, the court found that "barring the admissibility and discovery in state court of accident reports and other traffic and accident materials and 'raw data' that were originally prepared for routine state and local purposes, simply because they are 'collected' for, among other reasons, federal purposes pursuant to a federal statute" did not reasonably serve any "valid federal interest in the operation of the federal safety enhancement program." Id., at 737, 31 P. 3d, at 651. With respect to the Commerce Clause, the court concluded that § 409 was not an "integral part" of the regulation of the federal-aid highway system and, thus, could not be upheld under Hodel v. Indiana,452 U.S. 314, 69 L. Ed. 2d 40, 101 S. Ct. 2376 (1981). 144 Wash. 2d, at 742, 31 P. 3d, at 654. Finally, with respect to the Necessary and Proper Clause, the court ruled that, although Congress could require state courts to enforce a federal privilege protecting materials "that would not have been created but-for federal mandates such as . . . [§ ]152," it was "neither 'necessary' nor 'proper' for Congress in 1995 to extend that privilege to traffic and accident materials and raw data created and collected for state and local purposes, simply because they are also collected and used for federal purposes." Id., at 743, 31 P. 3d, at 654-655.

In light of its conclusion that the 1995 amendment to § 409 exceeded Congress' power under the Constitution, and,  therefore, was not binding on the States, the court held that § 409 protected only information originally created for § 152 purposes. But, rather than determining whether the documents or data at issue in this case would be protected under its reading of § 409, the court  vacated the lower court's judgment and remanded the case for the lower courts to consider the record in the first instance. 4The court also ruled that respondents were entitled to attorney's fees in their PDA action. See 144 Wash. 2d, at 745; 31 P. 3d, at 655- 656.

Three justices concurred only in the result. They disagreed with the majority's broad reading of the statute and would  have held that § 409 precludes a potential plaintiff only from obtaining information from an agency that collected that information for § 152 purposes.

We granted certiorari to resolve the question of the constitutionality of this federal statute, 535 U.S. 1033, 152 L. Ed. 2d 648, 122 S. Ct. 1788, (2002), and now reverse.

IIBefore addressing the merits of petitioner's claims, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to hear the case. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1257(a), this Court has certiorari jurisdiction to review "final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had . . . where the validity of a . . . statute of the United States is drawn in question . . . on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution . . . of the United States." As a general matter, to be reviewed by this Court, a state-court judgment must be final "'as an effective determination of the litigation and not of merely interlocutory or intermediate steps therein.'" Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U.S. 75, 81, 139 L. Ed. 2d 433, 118 S. Ct. 481 (1997) (quoting Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of Cal.,324 U.S. 548, 551, 89 L. Ed. 1171, 65 S. Ct. 770 (1945)).We have acknowledged, however, that certain state-court judgments can be treated as final for jurisdictional purposes, even though further  proceedings are to take place in the state courts.  Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,420 U.S. 469, 477-483, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 95 S. Ct. 1029 (1975) (outlining four exceptions to the finality rule). See also, e.g., ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish,490 U.S. 605, 611-612, 104 L. Ed. 2d 696, 109 S. Ct. 2037 (1989) (applying the Cox exceptions); Duquesne Light Co. v. Barasch,488 U.S. 299, 306-307, 102 L. Ed. 2d 646, 109 S. Ct. 609 (1989) (same).

Respondents contend the decision below did not result in a final judgment for purposes of § 1257(a) because the Washington Supreme Court remanded the case for further proceedings. They are only partially correct.

As we have already described, we have now before us a consolidated case consisting of two separate actions: an action under the State of Washington's Public Disclosure Act and a tort action. Respondents are correct that the decision below does not constitute a final judgment with respect to the tort action. In that case, the Washington Supreme Court resolved only a discovery dispute; it did not determine the final outcome of the litigation. Nor do any of the exceptions outlined in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, supra, apply to the tort action. 5With respect to the first Cox exception, the Washington Supreme Court's interpretation of § 409 is not conclusive and does not foreordain the outcome of the proceedings below, as petitioner might well be able to prove that its actions regarding the 168/B intersection were not negligent. Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn,420 U.S. 469, 479, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 95 S. Ct. 1029 (1975). Moreover, petitioner's victory on the merits would moot the discovery issue; accordingly, the second Cox exception is not implicated. Id., at 480. And, if petitioner does not prevail on the merits, it remains free to raise the discovery issue on appeal. Even if the Washington Supreme Court adheres to its interlocutory ruling as "law of the case," we would still be able to review the discovery issue once a final judgment has been entered. Jefferson v. City of Tarrant, 522 U.S. 75, 82-83, 139 L. Ed. 2d 433, 118 S. Ct. 481 (1997). In short, the third Cox exception does not help petitioner either. Cox Broadcasting Corp., 420 U.S., at 481. Finally, this is not a case where "reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation," id., at 482-483, because respondents remain free to try their tort case without the disputed documents. Rather, the decision below controls "merely . . . the nature and character of, or . . . the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come." Id., at 483. Thus, petitioner finds no refuge in the fourth Cox exception. Accordingly, we dismiss the writ  of certiorari with respect  to the tort action for want of jurisdiction.



We reach a different conclusion regarding the PDA action. In that suit, the  Washington Supreme Court was asked to review only the appellate court's ruling that four of the five documents requested by respondents were not protected under § 409 and therefore should be disclosed under the PDA. 6Respondents did not seek review of the Court of Appeal's decision that one of the requested documents -- a draft memorandum from the public works director to a county council member, see n. 3, supra -- was in fact protected by § 409 because it contained information derived from § 152 activities. See 96 Wn. App. 862, 874, 982 P.2d 123, 130 (1999). See also Reply to Brief in Opposition 2. Because the Washington Supreme Court held the 1995 amendment to § 409 to be invalid -- thus, limiting the privilege offered by the statute only to documents originally created for § 152 purposes -- the court effectively interpreted § 409 more narrowly than the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the four documents at issue before the Washington Supreme Court remained unprotected under § 409 and continued to be subject to disclosure under the PDA. As we read the decision below, all that remains to be decided on remand in the PDA action is the amount of attorney's fees to which respondents are entitled. The PDA action, then, falls squarely under the first Cox exception because the Washington Supreme Court's ruling on the federal privilege issue is "conclusive" and "the outcome of further proceedings preordained." 7Our reading of the decision below is reinforced by the Washington Supreme Court's ruling that respondents are entitled to attorney's fees for the PDA action. See n. 4, supra. Under state law, attorney's fees may not be awarded in a PDA action unless the prevailing party has "an affirmative judgment rendered in its favor at the conclusion of the entire case." Overlake Fund v. Bellevue, 70 Wn. App. 789, 795, 855 P.2d 706, 710 (1993); see also Tacoma News, Inc. v. Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dep't,55 Wn. App. 515, 525, 778 P.2d 1066, 1071 (1989), review denied, 113 Wn.2d 1037, 785 P.2d 825 (1990) (Table). Thus, because the Washington Supreme Court held that respondents were entitled to attorney's fees in the PDA action, it must have considered the merits of that action to have been conclusively determined.Cox Broadcasting Corp.,420 U.S., at 479. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to hear the PDA portion of this case.



 III

We turn now to the merits. Petitioner essentially agrees with the Washington Supreme Court's expansive reading of § 409, but argues that the Washington Supreme Court erred in concluding that Congress was without power to enact the 1995 amendment to § 409. Before addressing the constitutional question, however,  we must determine the statute's proper scope.

A

1

According to petitioner, a document initially prepared and then held by an agency (here the county sheriff) for purposes unrelated to § 152 becomes protected under § 409 when a copy of that document is collected by another agency (here the Public Works Department) for purposes of § 152. Under petitioner's view, for example, an accident report prepared and held by the county sheriff for purposes unrelated to § 152 would become protected under § 409 as soon as a copy of that report is sent to the Public Works Department to be used in connection with petitioner's § 152 funding application. Consequently, a person seeking a copy of the accident report either from the county sheriff or from the Public Works Department would not be able to obtain it. 8Indeed, petitioner's brief could be read as suggesting that § 409 protects not only materials containing information collected for § 152 purposes but also any testimony regarding information contained in such materials. Brief for Petitioner 44. See also Brief for Respondents 20 (offering this reading as a possible interpretation of the statute). Under this view, an officer who witnessed an accident would not be permitted to testify about that accident, if the officer summarized what he saw in a report that was later "collected" for § 152 purposes. But see Brief for Petitioner 45-46 (asserting that testimony derived from sources apart from the protected documents is permitted under § 409). Brief for Petitioner 37-44.

 Respondents contend that § 409 protects only materials actually created by the agency responsible for seeking federal funding for § 152 purposes. Brief for Respondents 22-23, and n. 2. On their view, if the Public Works Department collects reports of all the accidents that have occurred at a given intersection to prepare its § 152 application, those reports would not be protected by § 409, and a person seeking them from the Public Works Department would be entitled to obtain them.

The United States proposes a third interpretation: § 409 protects all reports, surveys, schedules, lists, or data actually compiled or collected for § 152 purposes, but does not protect information that was originally compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to § 152 and that is currently held by the agencies that compiled or collected it, even if the information was at some point "collected" by another agency for § 152 purposes. Brief for United States 28-36. Respondents concede that this a defensible reading of the statute. Brief for Respondents 23-24, 25. Under this interpretation, an accident report collected only for law enforcement purposes and held by the county sheriff would not be protected under § 409 in the hands of the county sheriff, even though that same report would be protected in the hands of the Public Works Department, so long as the department first obtained the report for § 152 purposes. We agree with the Government's interpretation of the statute.

2We have often recognized that statutes establishing evidentiary privileges must be construed narrowly because privileges impede the search for the truth. Baldrige v. Shapiro,455 U.S. 345, 360, 71 L. Ed. 2d 199, 102 S. Ct. 1103 (1982) ("A statute granting a privilege is to be strictly construed so as 'to avoid a  construction that would suppress otherwise competent evidence'" (quoting St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States,368 U.S. 208, 218, 7 L. Ed. 2d 240, 82 S. Ct. 289 (1961)). See also, e.g., University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC,493 U.S. 182, 189, 107 L. Ed. 2d 571, 110 S. Ct. 577 (1990). See generally United States v. Nixon,418 U.S. 683, 41 L. Ed. 2d 1039, 94 S. Ct. 3090 (1974). Here, § 409 establishes a privilege; accordingly, to the extent the text of the statute permits, we must construe it narrowly.

Of the three interpretations outlined above, respondents' clearly gives the statute the narrowest application. Nevertheless, we decline to adopt it, as that reading would render the 1995 amendment to § 409 (changing the language from "compiled" to "compiled or collected") an exercise in futility. We have said before that, "when Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect." Stone v. INS,514 U.S. 386, 397, 131 L. Ed. 2d 465, 115 S. Ct. 1537 (1995).Yet, under respondents' view, § 409 as amended in 1995 would protect from disclosure only information that was already protected before the amendment, i.e., information generated for § 152 purposes. That reading gives the amendment no "real and substantial effect" and, accordingly, cannot be the proper understanding of the statute.

Petitioner's reading, by contrast, while permissible, gives the statute too broad of a reach given the language of the statute, thus conflicting with our rule that, when possible, privileges should be construed narrowly. See, e.g., Baldrige, supra, at 360.The interpretation proposed by the Government, however, suffers neither of these faults. It gives effect to the 1995 amendment by making clear that § 409 protects not just the information an agency generates, i.e., compiles, for § 152 purposes, but also any information that an agency collects from other sources for § 152 purposes. And, it also takes a narrower view of the privilege by making it inapplicable to information compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to§ 152 and held by agencies that are not pursuing § 152 objectives. We therefore adopt this interpretation.

Our conclusion is reinforced by the history of the 1995 amendment. As we have already noted, the phrase "or collected" was added to § 409 to address confusion among the lower courts about the proper scope of § 409 and to overcome judicial reluctance to protect under § 409 raw data collected for § 152 purposes. See supra, at 3-4. By amending the statute, Congress wished to make clear that § 152 was not intended to be an effort-free tool in litigation against state and local governments. Compare, e.g., Robertson v. Union Pacific R. Co., 954 F.2d 1433, 1435 (CA8 1992) (recognizing that § 409 was intended to "prohibit federally required record-keeping from being used as a 'tool . . . in private litigation'" (quoting Light v. New York, 149 Misc. 2d 75, 80, 560 N.Y.S.2d 962, 965 (Ct. Cl. 1990)), with authorities cited supra, at 3-4. However, the text of § 409 evinces no intent to make plaintiffs worse off than they would have been had § 152 funding never existed. Put differently, there is no reason to interpret § 409 as prohibiting the disclosure of information  compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to § 152, held by government agencies not involved in administering § 152, if, before § 152 was adopted, plaintiffs would have been free to obtain such information from those very agencies.

B

Having determined that § 409 protects only information compiled or collected for § 152 purposes, and does not protect information compiled or collected for purposes unrelated to § 152, as held by the agencies that compiled or collected that information, we now consider whether § 409 is a proper exercise of Congress' authority under the Constitution. We conclude that it is.

It is well established that the Commerce Clause gives Congress authority to "regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce." United States v. Lopez,514 U.S. 549, 558, 131 L. Ed. 2d 626, 115 S. Ct. 1624 (1995) (citing United States v. Darby,312 U.S. 100, 114, 85 L. Ed. 609, 61 S. Ct. 451 (1941);Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,379 U.S. 241, 256, 13 L. Ed. 2d 258, 85 S. Ct. 348 (1964)). In addition, under the Commerce Clause, Congress "is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities." Lopez, supra, at 558 (citing Shreveport Rate Cases,234 U.S. 342, 58 L. Ed. 1341, 34 S. Ct. 833 (1914);Southern R. Co. v. United States,222 U.S. 20, 56 L. Ed. 72, 32 S. Ct. 2 (1911);Perez v. United States,402 U.S. 146, 28 L. Ed. 2d 686, 91 S. Ct. 1357 (1971)). As already discussed, supra, at 1-2, Congress adopted § 152 to assist state and local governments in reducing hazardous conditions in the Nation's channels of commerce. That effort was impeded, however, by the States' reluctance to comply fully with the requirements of § 152, as such compliance would make state and local governments easier targets for negligence actions by providing would-be plaintiffs a centralized location from which they could obtain much of the evidence necessary for such actions. In view of these circumstances, Congress could reasonably believe that adopting a measure eliminating an unforeseen side effect of the information-gathering requirement of § 152 would result in more diligent efforts to collect the relevant information, more candid discussions of hazardous locations, better informed decisionmaking, and, ultimately, greater safety on our Nation's  roads. Consequently, both the original § 409 and the 1995 amendment can be viewed as legislation aimed at improving safety in the channels of commerce and increasing protection for the instrumentalities of interstate commerce. As such, they fall within Congress' Commerce Clause power. 9Because we conclude that Congress had authority under the Commerce Clause to enact both the original § 409 and the 1995 amendment, we need not decide whether they could also be a proper exercise of Congress' authority under the Spending Clause or the Necessary and Proper Clause. Accordingly, the judgment of the Washington  Supreme  Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 10Respondents contend in passing that § 409 violates the principles of dual sovereignty embodied in the Tenth Amendment because it prohibits a State from exercising its sovereign powers to establish discovery and admissibility rules to be used in state court for a state cause of action. See Brief for Respondents 44-46. The court below did not address this precise argument, reasoning instead that the 1995 amendment to § 409 was beyond Congress' enumerated powers. We ordinarily do not decide in the first instance issues not resolved below and decline to do so here. See, e.g., NCAA v. Smith, 525 U.S. 459, 470, 142 L. Ed. 2d 929, 119 S. Ct. 924 (1999). Moreover, in light of our disposition on this issue, we need not address the second question on which we granted certiorari: whether private plaintiffs have standing to assert "states' rights" under the Tenth Amendment where their States' legislative and executive branches expressly approve and accept the benefits and terms of the federal statute in question.



 It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE SCALIA announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, IV, and V, and an opinion with respect to Part III, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE THOMAS join *JUSTICE KENNEDY joins all but Part III of this opinion. .

In this case, we consider once again the applicability of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy  Clause in the context of capital-sentencing proceedings.

I

On Sunday evening, April 12, 1987, Petitioner David Allen Sattazahn and his accomplice, Jeffrey Hammer, hid in a wooded area waiting to rob Richard Boyer, manager of the Heidelberg Family Restaurant. Sattazahn carried a .22-caliber Ruger semiautomatic pistol and Hammer a .41-caliber revolver. They accosted Boyer in the restaurant's parking lot at closing time. With guns drawn, they demanded the bank deposit bag containing the day's receipts. Boyer threw the bag toward the roof of the restaurant. Petitioner commanded Boyer to retrieve the bag, but instead of complying Boyer tried to run away. Both petitioner and Hammer fired shots, and Boyer fell dead. The two men then grabbed the deposit bag and fled.

 The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania prosecuted petitioner and sought the death penalty. On May 10, 1991, a jury returned a conviction of first-, second-, and third-degree murder, and various other charges. In accordance with Pennsylvania law the proceeding then moved into a penalty phase. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 1102(a)(1) (1998); 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9711(a)(1) (Supp.  2000). The Commonwealth presented evidence of one statutory aggravating circumstance: commission of the murder while in the perpetration of a felony. See § 9711(d)(6). Petitioner presented as mitigating circumstances his lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and his age at  the time of the crime. See §§ 9711(e)(1), (4).  563 Pa. 533, 539, 763 A.2d 359, 362 (2000).

Pennsylvania law provides that, in the penalty phase of capital proceedings:

"(iv) the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance . . . and no mitigating circumstance or if the jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances. The verdict must be a sentence of life imprisonment in all other cases.

"(v) the court may, in its discretion, discharge the jury if it is of the opinion that further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment." § 9711(c).

After both sides presented their evidence, the jury deliberated for some 3 1/2 hours, App. 23, after which it returned a note signed by the foreman which read: "We, the jury are hopelessly deadlocked at 9 to 3 for life imprisonment. Each one is deeply entrenched in their [sic] position. We do not expect anyone to change his or her position." Id., at 25. Petitioner then moved "under 9711(c), subparagraph 1, subparagraph Roman Numeral 5, that the jury be discharged and that [the court] enter a sentence of life imprisonment." Id., at 22. The trial judge, in accordance with Pennsylvania law, discharged the jury as hung, and indicated that he would enter the required life sentence, id., at 23-24, which he later did, id., at 30-33.

Petitioner appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court. That court concluded that the trial judge had erred in instructing the jury in connection with various offenses with  which petitioner was charged, including first-degree murder. It accordingly reversed petitioner's first-degree murder conviction and remanded for a new trial.  Commonwealth v. Sattazahn,428 Pa. Super. 413, 631 A.2d 597 (1993).

On remand, Pennsylvania filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. In addition to the aggravating circumstance alleged at the first sentencing hearing, the notice also alleged a second aggravating circumstance, petitioner's significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person. (This was based on guilty pleas to a murder, multiple burglaries, and a robbery entered after the first trial.) Petitioner moved to prevent Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty and from adding the second aggravating circumstance on retrial. The trial court denied the motion, the Superior Court affirmed the denial, App. 73, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to review the ruling, Commonwealth v. Sattazahn, 547 Pa. 742, 690 A.2d 1162 (1997). At the second trial, the jury again convicted petitioner of first-degree murder, but this time imposed a sentence of death.

On direct appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed both the verdict of guilt and the sentence of death on retrial. 563 Pa., at 551, 763 A. 2d, at 369. Relying on its earlier decision in Commonwealth v. Martorano, 535 Pa. 178, 634 A.2d 1063 (1993), the court concluded that neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Due Process Clause barred Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty at petitioner's retrial. 563 Pa., at 544-548, 763 A. 2d, at 366-367. We granted certiorari, 535 U.S. 926, 152 L. Ed. 2d 207, 122 S. Ct. 1294 (2002).

 II

A The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment commands that "no person shall . . . be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." Under this Clause, once a defendant is placed in jeopardy for an offense, and jeopardy terminates with respect to that offense, the defendant may neither be tried nor punished a second time for the same offense. North Carolina v. Pearce,395 U.S. 711, 717, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656, 89 S. Ct. 2072 (1969). Where, as here, a defendant is convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, but appeals the conviction and succeeds in having it set aside, we have held that jeopardy has not terminated, so that the life sentence imposed in connection with the initial conviction raises no double-jeopardy bar to a death sentence on retrial. Stroud v. United States,251 U.S. 15, 64 L. Ed. 103, 40 S. Ct. 50 (1919).

In Stroud, the only offense at issue was that of murder, and the sentence was imposed by a judge who did not have to make any further findings in order to impose the death penalty. Id., at 18.In Bullington v. Missouri,451 U.S. 430, 68 L. Ed. 2d 270, 101 S. Ct. 1852 (1981), however, we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does apply to capital-sentencing proceedings where such proceedings "have the hallmarks of the trial on guilt or innocence." Id., at 439. We identified several aspects of Missouri's sentencing proceeding that resembled a trial, including the requirement that the prosecution prove certain statutorily defined  facts beyond a reasonable doubt to support a sentence of death.  Id., at 438. Such a procedure, we explained, "explicitly requires the jury to determine whether the prosecution has 'proved its case.'" Id., at 444. Since, we concluded, a sentence of life imprisonment signifies that "'the jury has already acquitted the defendant of whatever was necessary to impose the death sentence,'" the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a State from seeking the death penalty on retrial. Id., at 445 (quoting State ex rel. Westfall v. Mason, 594 S.W.2d 908, 922 (Mo. 1980) (Bardgett, C. J., dissenting)).

We were, however, careful to emphasize that it is not the mere imposition of a life sentence that raises a double-jeopardy bar. We discussed Stroud, a case in which a defendant who had been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment obtained a reversal of his conviction and a new trial when the Solicitor General confessed error. In Stroud, the Court unanimously held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar imposition of the death penalty at the new trial.  251 U.S., at 17-18. What distinguished Bullington from Stroud, we said, was the fact that in Stroud "there was no separate sentencing proceeding at which the prosecution was required to prove -- beyond a reasonable doubt or otherwise -- additional facts in order to justify the particular sentence." Bullington, 451 U.S., at 439. We made clear that an "acquittal" at a trial-like sentencing phase, rather than the mere imposition of a life sentence, is required to give rise to double-jeopardy protections.  Id., at 446.

Later decisions refined Bullington's rationale. In Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 81 L. Ed. 2d 164, 104 S. Ct. 2305 (1984), the State had argued in the sentencing phase, based on evidence presented during the guilt phase, that three statutory aggravating circumstances were present. The trial court, however, found that no statutory aggravator existed, and accordingly entered judgment in the accused's favor on the issue of death. On the State's cross-appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona concluded that the trial court had erred in its interpretation of one of the statutory aggravating circumstances, and remanded for a new sentencing proceeding, which produced a sentence of death.  Id., at 205-206. In setting that sentence aside, we explained that "the double jeopardy principle relevant to [Rumsey's] case is the same as that invoked in Bullington: an acquittal on the merits by the sole decisionmaker  in the proceeding is final and bars retrial on the same charge." Id., at 211.

"The trial court entered findings denying the existence of each of the seven statutory aggravating circumstances, and as required by state law, the court  then entered judgment in respondent's favor on the issue of death. That judgment, based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence, amounts to an acquittal on the merits and, as such, bars any retrial of the appropriateness of the death penalty." Ibid. (emphasis added).

Rumsey thus reaffirmed that the relevant inquiry for double-jeopardy purposes was not whether the defendant received a life sentence the first time around, but rather whether a first life sentence was an "acquittal" based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence -- i. e., findings that the government failed to prove one or more aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt.

A later case in the line, Poland v. Arizona, 476 U.S. 147, 90 L. Ed. 2d 123, 106 S. Ct. 1749 (1986), involved two defendants convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. On appeal the Arizona Supreme Court set aside the convictions (because of jury consideration of nonrecord evidence) and further found that there was insufficient evidence to support the one aggravating circumstance found by the trial court. It concluded, however, that there was sufficient evidence to support a different aggravating circumstance, which the trial court had thought not proved. The court remanded for retrial; the defendants were again convicted of first-degree murder, and a sentence of death was again imposed. Id., at 149-150.We decided that in those circumstances, the Double Jeopardy Clause was not implicated. We distinguished Bullington and Rumsey on the ground that in Poland, unlike in those cases, neither the judge nor the jury had "acquitted" the defendant  in his first capital sentencing proceeding by entering findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence. 476 U.S., at 155-157.

BNormally, "a retrial following a 'hung jury' does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause." Richardson v. United States,468 U.S. 317, 324, 82 L. Ed. 2d 242, 104 S. Ct. 3081 (1984). Petitioner contends, however, that given the unique treatment afforded capital-sentencing proceedings under Bullington, double-jeopardy protections were triggered when the jury deadlocked at his first sentencing proceeding and the court prescribed a sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to Pennsylvania law.

We disagree. Under the Bullington line of cases just discussed, the touchstone for double-jeopardy protection in capital-sentencing proceedings is whether there has been an "acquittal." Petitioner here cannot establish that the jury or the court "acquitted" him during his first capital-sentencing proceeding. As to the jury: The verdict form returned by the foreman stated that the jury deadlocked 9- to-3 on whether to impose the death penalty; it made no findings with respect to the alleged aggravating circumstance. That result -- or more appropriately, that non-result -- cannot fairly be called an acquittal "based on findings sufficient to establish legal entitlement to the life sentence." Rumsey, supra, at 211.

The entry of a life sentence by the judge was not "acquittal," either. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court explained:

"'Under Pennsylvania's sentencing scheme, the judge has no discretion to fashion sentence once he finds that the jury is deadlocked. The statute directs him to enter a  life sentence. 42 Pa. C. S. § 9711(c)(1)(v) ( . . . if . . . further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, . . . the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.) (emphasis added). The judge makes no findings and resolves no  factual matter. Since judgment is not based on findings which resolve some factual matter, it is not sufficient to establish legal entitlement to a life sentence. A default judgment does not  trigger a double jeopardy bar to the death penalty upon retrial.'" 563 Pa., at 548, 763 A. 2d, at 367 (quoting Martorano, 535 Pa., at 194, 634 A. 2d, at 1070). It could be argued, perhaps, that the statutorily required entry of a life sentence creates an "entitlement" even without an "acquittal," because that is what the Pennsylvania Legislature intended -- i.e., it intended that the life sentence should survive vacation of the underlying conviction. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, did not find such intent in the statute -- and there was eminently good cause not to do so. A State's simple interest in closure might make it willing to accept the default penalty of life imprisonment when the conviction is affirmed and the case is, except for that issue, at an end -- but unwilling to do so when the case must be retried anyway. And its interest in conservation of resources might make it willing to leave the sentencing issue unresolved (and the default life sentence in place) where the cost of resolving it is the empaneling of a new jury and, in all likelihood, a repetition of much of the guilt phase of the first trial -- though it is eager to attend to that unfinished business if there is to be a new jury and a new trial anyway.

III

A

When Bullington, Rumsey, and Poland were decided, capital-sentencing proceedings were understood to be just that: sentencing proceedings. Whatever "hallmarks of [a] trial" they might have borne, Bullington, 451 U.S., at 439, they differed from trials in a respect crucial for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause: They dealt only with the sentence to be imposed for the "offence" of capital murder. Thus, in its search for a rationale to support Bullington and  its "progeny," the Court continually tripped over the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

 Recent developments, however, have illuminated this part of our jurisprudence. Our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), clarified what constitutes an "element" of an offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee. Put simply, if the existence of any fact (other than a prior conviction) increases the maximum punishment that may be imposed on a defendant, that fact -- no matter how the State labels it -- constitutes an element, and must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 482-484, 490.

Just last Term we recognized the import of Apprendi in the context of capital-sentencing proceedings. In Ring v. Arizona,536 U.S. 584, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002), we held that aggravating circumstances that make a defendant eligible for  the death penalty "operate as 'the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense.'" Id., at 609) (emphasis added). That is to say, for purposes of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee, the underlying offense of "murder" is a distinct, lesser included offense of "murder plus one or more aggravating circumstances": Whereas the former exposes a defendant to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, the latter increases the maximum permissible sentence to death. Accordingly, we held that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, and not a judge, find the existence of any aggravating circumstances, and that they be found, not by a mere preponderance of the evidence, but beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 608-609). We can think of no principled reason to distinguish, in this context, between what constitutes an offense for purposes of the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee and what constitutes an "offence" for purposes of the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause. Cf . Monge v. California,524 U.S. 721, 738, 141 L. Ed. 2d 615, 118 S. Ct. 2246 (1998) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) ("The fundamental distinction between  facts that are elements of a criminal  offense and facts that go only to the sentence" not only "delimits the boundaries of . . . important constitutional rights, like the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury," but also "provides the foundation for our entire double jeopardy jurisprudence"). In the post-Ring world, the Double Jeopardy Clause can, and must, apply to some capital-sentencing proceedings consistent with the text of the Fifth Amendment. If a jury unanimously concludes that a State has failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of one or more aggravating circumstances, double-jeopardy protections attach to that "acquittal" on the offense of "murder plus aggravating circumstance(s)." Thus, Rumsey was correct to focus on whether a factfinder had made findings that constituted an "acquittal" of the aggravating circumstances; but the reason that issue was central is not that a capital-sentencing proceeding is "comparable to a trial," 467 U.S., at 209 (citing Bullington, supra, at 438), but rather that "murder plus one or more aggravating circumstances" is a separate offense from "murder" simpliciter.

B

For purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, then, "first-degree murder" under Pennsylvania law -- the offense of which petitioner was convicted during the guilt phase of his proceedings -- is properly understood to be a lesser included offense of "first-degree murder plus aggravating circumstance(s)." See Ring, supra, at 609). Thus, if petitioner's first sentencing jury had unanimously concluded that Pennsylvania failed to prove any aggravating circumstances, that conclusion would operate as an "acquittal" of the greater offense -- which would bar Pennsylvania from retrying petitioner on that greater offense (and thus, from seeking the death penalty) on retrial. Cf.  Rumsey, supra, at 211.

 But that is not what happened. Petitioner was convicted in the guilt phase of his first trial of the lesser  offense of first-degree murder. During the sentencing phase, the jury  deliberated without reaching a decision on death or life, and without making any findings regarding aggravating or mitigating circumstances. After 3 1/2 hours the judge dismissed the jury as hung and entered a life sentence in accordance with Pennsylvania law. As explained, supra, at 7-8, neither judge nor jury "acquitted" petitioner of the greater offense of "first-degree murder plus aggravating circumstance(s)." Thus, when petitioner appealed and succeeded in invalidating his conviction of the lesser offense, there was no double-jeopardy bar to Pennsylvania's retrying petitioner on both the lesser and the greater offense; his "jeopardy" never terminated with respect to either. Cf.  Green v. United States,355 U.S. 184, 189, 2 L. Ed. 2d 199, 78 S. Ct. 221, 77 Ohio Law Abs. 202 (1957) (citing United States v. Ball,163 U.S. 662, 41 L. Ed. 300, 16 S. Ct. 1192 (1896)); Selvester v. United States,170 U.S. 262, 269, 42 L. Ed. 1029, 18 S. Ct. 580 (1898).

IV The dissent reads the Court's decision in United States v. Scott,437 U.S. 82, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65, 98 S. Ct. 2187 (1978), as supporting the proposition that where, as here, a defendant's "case was fully tried and the court, on its own motion, entered a final judgment -- a life sentence -- terminating the trial proceedings," post, at 9, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial. There are several problems with this reasoning.

 First, it is an understatement to say that "Scott . . . did not home in on a case like [petitioner's]," post, at 6 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). The statement upon which the dissent relies -- that double jeopardy "may"attach when the "trial judge terminates the proceedings favorably to the defendant on a basis not related to factual guilt or innocence," 437 U.S., at 92,  at least where the defendant "had either been found not guilty or . . . had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact," id., at 96 (emphasis added) -- was nothing more than dictum, and a tentative one ("may") at that. It would be a thin reed on which to rest a hitherto unknown constitutional prohibition of the entirely rational course of  making a hung jury's failure to convict provisionally final, subject to change if the case must be retried anyway.

Second, the dictum in Scott does not even embrace the present case. The petitioner here did not "insist" upon a merits determination, but to the contrary asked that the jury be dismissed as hung. As the dissent recognizes, when the jury announced that it was deadlocked, petitioner "moved 'that the jury be discharged' and that a life sentence be entered under [42 Pa. Cons. Stat.] § 9711(c)(1)(v)." Post, at 9, n. 5. It is no response to say that "the judge did not grant [the] motion," but instead made a legal determination whether petitioner was entitled to the judgment he sought. Ibid. Surely double-jeopardy protections cannot hinge on whether a trial court characterizes its action as self-initiated or in response to motion. Cf.  Scott, supra, at 96. What actually happened in this case  is the same as what happened in Scott, where we denied double-jeopardy protection: (1) the defendant moved for entry of a judgment in his favor on procedural grounds (there, delay in indictment; here, a hung jury); (2) the judge measured facts (there, the length of delay; here, the likelihood of the jury's producing a verdict) against a legal standard to determine whether such relief was appropriate; and (3) concluding that it was, granted the relief.

Nor, in these circumstances, does the prospect of a second capital-sentencing proceeding implicate any of the "perils against which the Double Jeopardy Clause seeks to protect." Post, at 7 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting). The dissent stresses that a defendant in such circumstances is "subject to the 'ordeal' of a second full-blown life or death trial," which "'compels [him] to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.'" Ibid. (quoting Green v. United States, supra, at 187); see also post, at 11. But as even the dissent must admit, post, at 8, we have not found this concern determinative of double jeopardy in all circumstances. And it should not be so here. This case hardly presents the specter of "an  all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact." Scott, supra, at 96. Instead, we see here a state which, for any number of perfectly understandable reasons, supra, at 8-9, has quite reasonably agreed to accept the default penalty of life imprisonment when the conviction is affirmed and the case is, except for that issue, at an end -- but to pursue its not-yet-vindicated interest in "'one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws'" where the case must be retried anyway, post, at 7 (quoting Arizona v. Washington,434 U.S. 497, 509, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717, 98 S. Ct. 824 (1978)).

V

In addition to his double-jeopardy claim, petitioner raises a freestanding claim alleging deprivation of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. He contends that, regardless of whether the imposition of the death sentence at the second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, it unfairly deprived him of his "life" and "liberty" interests in the life sentence resulting from his first sentencing proceeding. He frames the argument in these terms:

"Pennsylvania created a constitutionally protected life and liberty interest in the finality of the life judgment statutorily mandated as a result of a [deadlocked]  jury. That right vested when the court found the jury deadlocked and imposed a mandatory life sentence. Subjecting petitioner to a capital resentencing once that right has vested violated Due Process." Reply Brief for Petitioner 18-19.

We think not. Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that "no State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . ." (emphasis added). Nothing indicates that any "life" or "liberty"  interest that Pennsylvania law may have given petitioner  in the life sentence imposed after his first capital sentencing proceeding was somehow immutable. And he was "deprived" of any such interest only by operation of the "process" he invoked to invalidate the underlying first-degree murder conviction on which it was based.

At bottom, petitioner's due-process claim is nothing more than his double-jeopardy claim in different clothing. As we have said:

"The Bill of Rights speaks in explicit terms to many aspects of criminal procedure, and the expansion of those constitutional guarantees under the open-ended rubric of the Due Process Clause invites undue interference with both considered legislative judgments and the careful balance that the Constitution strikes between liberty and order." Medina v. California,505 U.S. 437, 443, 120 L. Ed. 2d 353, 112 S. Ct. 2572 (1992).

We decline petitioner's invitation to hold that the Due Process Clause provides greater double-jeopardy protection than does the Double Jeopardy Clause.

* * *

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court correctly concluded that neither the Fifth Amendment's Double Jeopardy Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause barred Pennsylvania from seeking the death penalty against petitioner on retrial. The judgment of that court is, therefore,

Affirmed.  


JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights. The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: "Congress shall have  Power . . . to promote the Progress of Science . . . by securing [to Authors] for limited Times . . . the exclusive Right to their . . . Writings." In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years. Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA), Pub. L. 105-298, § 102(b) and (d), 112 Stat. 2827-2828 (amending 17 U.S.C. §§ 302, 304).  As in the case of prior extensions, principally in 1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of the enlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.

Petitioners are individuals and businesses whose products or services build on copyrighted works that have gone into the public domain. They seek a determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the Copyright Clause's "limited Times" prescription and the First Amendment's free speech guarantee. Under the 1976 Copyright Act, copyright protection generally lasted from the work's creation until 50 years after the author's death. Pub. L. 94-553, § 302(a), 90 Stat. 2572 (1976 Act). Under the CTEA, most copyrights now run from creation until 70 years after the author's death.  17 U.S.C. § 302(a). Petitioners do not challenge the "life-plus-70-years" time span itself. "Whether 50 years is enough, or 70 years too  much," they acknowledge, "is not a judgment meet for this Court." Brief for Petitioners 14. 1JUSTICE BREYER's dissent is not similarly restrained. He makes no effort meaningfully to distinguish existing copyrights from future grants. See, e.g., post, at 1, 13-19, 23-25. Under his reasoning, the CTEA's 20-year extension is globally unconstitutional.Congress went awry, petitioners maintain, not with respect to newly created works, but in enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights. The "limited Time" in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners urge, becomes the constitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the power of Congress to extend. See ibid. As to the First Amendment, petitioners contend that the CTEA is a content-neutral regulation of speech that fails inspection  under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for such regulations.

In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners' challenges to the CTEA. In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity. In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

I

A

We evaluate petitioners' challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress' previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause. The  Nation's first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term. Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, § 1, 1 Stat. 124 (1790 Act). The 1790 Act's renewable 14-year term applied to existing works (i.e., works already published and works created but not yet published) and future works alike. Ibid.Congress expanded the federal copyright term to 42 years in 1831 (28 years from publication, renewable for an additional 14 years), and to 56 years in 1909 (28 years from publication, renewable for an additional 28 years). Act of Feb. 3, 1831, ch. 16, §§ 1, 16, 4 Stat. 436, 439 (1831 Act); Act of Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 320, §§ 23-24, 35 Stat. 1080-1081 (1909 Act). Both times, Congress applied the new copyright term to existing and future works, 1831 Act §§ 1, 16; 1909 Act §§ 23-24; to qualify for the 1831 extension, an existing work had to be in its initial copyright term at the time the Act became effective, 1831 Act §§ 1,  16.

 In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms. 1976 Act §§ 302-304. For works created  by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work's creation, not -- as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts -- its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author's death. § 302(a). In these respects, the  1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 135 (1976). For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first. § 302(c).

These new copyright terms, the 1976 Act instructed, governed all works not published by its effective date of January 1, 1978, regardless of when the works were created. §§ 302-303. For published works with existing copyrights as of that date, the 1976 Act granted a copyright term of 75 years from the date of publication, § 304(a) and (b), a 19-year increase over the 56-year term applicable under the 1909 Act.

The measure at issue here, the CTEA, installed the fourth major duration extension of federal copyrights. 2Asserting that the last several decades have seen a proliferation of copyright legislation in departure from Congress' traditional pace of legislative amendment in this area, petitioners cite nine statutes passed between 1962 and 1974, each of which incrementally extended existing copyrights for brief periods. See Pub. L. 87-668, 76 Stat. 555; Pub. L. 89-142, 79 Stat. 581; Pub. L. 90-141, 81 Stat. 464; Pub. L. 90-416, 82 Stat. 397; Pub. L. 91-147, 83 Stat. 360; Pub. L. 91-555, 84 Stat. 1441; Pub. L. 92-170, 85 Stat. 490; Pub. L. 92-566, 86 Stat. 1181; Pub. L. 93-573, Title I, 88 Stat. 1873. As respondent (Attorney General Ashcroft) points out, however, these statutes were all temporary placeholders subsumed into the systemic changes effected by the 1976 Act. Brief for Respondent 9.Retaining the general structure of the 1976 Act, the CTEA enlarges the terms of all existing and future copyrights by 20 years. For works created by identified natural persons, the term now lasts from creation until 70 years after the author's  death.  17 U.S.C. § 302(a).  This standard harmonizes the baseline United States copyright term with the term adopted by the European Union in  1993. See Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 Harmonizing the Term of Protection of Copyright and Certain Related Rights, 1993 Official J. Eur. Cmty. 290 (EU Council Directive 93/98). For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the term is 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever expires first.  17 U.S.C. § 302(c).

Paralleling the 1976 Act, the CTEA applies these new terms to all works not published by January 1, 1978. §§ 302(a), 303(a). For works published before 1978 with existing copyrights as of the CTEA's effective date, the CTEA extends the term to 95 years from publication. § 304(a) and (b). Thus, in common with the 1831, 1909, and 1976 Acts, the CTEA's new terms apply to both future and existing copyrights. 3Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights. Reply Brief 3-7. The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act's copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections. See Brief for Petitioners 28-30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3-7. Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

 B

Petitioners' suit challenges the CTEA's constitutionality under both the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment. On cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings, the District Court entered judgment for the Attorney General (respondent here). Eldred v. Reno, 74 F. Supp. 2d 1 (DC 1999). The court held that the CTEA does not violate the "limited Times" restriction of the Copyright Clause because the CTEA's terms, though  longer than the 1976 Act's terms, are still limited, not perpetual,  and therefore fit within Congress' discretion.  Id., at 3. The court also held that "there are no First Amendment rights to use the copyrighted works of others." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. Eldred v. Reno, 239 F.3d 372, 345 U.S. App. D.C. 89, (2001). In that court's unanimous view, Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises,471 U.S. 539, 85 L. Ed. 2d 588, 105 S. Ct. 2218 (1985), foreclosed petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the CTEA. 239 F.3d at 375. Copyright, the court reasoned, does not impermissibly restrict free speech, for it grants the author an exclusive right only to the specific form of expression; it does not shield any idea or fact contained in the copyrighted work, and it allows for "fair use" even of the expression itself.  Id., 239 F.3d at 375-376.

A majority of the Court of Appeals also upheld the CTEA against petitioners' contention that the measure exceeds Congress' power under the Copyright Clause. Specifically, the court rejected petitioners' plea for interpretation of the "limited Times" prescription not discretely but with a view to the "preambular statement of purpose" contained in the Copyright Clause: "To promote the Progress of Science." Id., 239 F.3d at 377-378. Circuit precedent, Schnapper v. Foley, 215 U.S. App. D.C. 59, 667 F.2d 102 (CADC 1981), the court determined, precluded that plea. In this regard, the court took into account petitioners' acknowledgment that the preamble itself places no substantive limit on Congress' legislative power.  239 F.3d at 378.

The appeals court found nothing in the constitutional text or its history to suggest that "a term of years for a copyright is not a 'limited Time' if it may later be extended for another 'limited Time.'" Id., 239 F.3d at 379. The court recounted that "the First Congress made the Copyright Act of 1790 applicable to subsisting copyrights arising under the copyright laws of the several states." Ibid. That construction of Congress' authority under the Copyright Clause "by [those] contemporary with [the Constitution's] formation," the court said, merited  "very great" and in this case "almost conclusive" weight. Ibid. (quoting Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,111 U.S. 53, 57, 28 L. Ed. 349, 4 S. Ct. 279, 1884 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 186 (1884)). As early as McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202, 42 U.S. 202, 11 L. Ed. 102 (1843), the Court of Appeals added, this Court had made it "plain" that the same Clause permits Congress to "amplify the terms of an existing patent." 239 F.3d at 380. The appeals court recognized that this Court has been similarly deferential to the judgment of Congress in the realm of copyright. Ibid. (citing Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,464 U.S. 417, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774 (1984); Stewart v. Abend,495 U.S. 207, 109 L. Ed. 2d 184, 110 S. Ct. 1750 (1990)).

Concerning petitioners' assertion that Congress might evade the limitation on its authority  by stringing together "an unlimited number of 'limited Times,'" the Court of Appeals stated that such legislative misbehavior "clearly is not the situation before us." 239 F.3d at 379. Rather, the court noted, the CTEA "matches" the baseline term for "United States copyrights [with] the terms of copyrights granted by the European Union." Ibid. "In an era of multinational publishers and instantaneous electronic transmission," the court said, "harmonization in this regard has obvious practical benefits" and is "a 'necessary and proper' measure to meet contemporary circumstances rather than a step on the way to making copyrights perpetual." Ibid.

 Judge Sentelle dissented in part. He concluded that Congress lacks power under the Copyright Clause to expand the copyright terms of existing works.  Id., 239 F.3d at 380-384. The Court of Appeals subsequently denied rehearing and rehearing en banc.  Eldred v. Ashcroft, 347 U.S. App. D.C. 121, 255 F.3d 849 (2001).We granted certiorari to address two questions: whether the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights exceeds Congress' power under the Copyright Clause; and whether the CTEA's extension of existing  and future copyrights violates the First Amendment. Eldred v. Ashcroft, 534 U.S. 1126, 151 L. Ed. 2d 966, 122 S. Ct. 1062 (2002).and [534 U.S.] 1160, 152 L. Ed. 2d 115, 112 S. Ct. 1170 (2002).We now answer those two questions in the negative and affirm.

A

We address first the determination of the courts below that Congress has authority under the Copyright Clause to extend the terms of existing copyrights. Text, history, and precedent, we conclude, confirm that the Copyright Clause empowers Congress to prescribe "limited Times" for copyright protection and to secure the same level and duration of protection for all copyright holders, present and future.

 The CTEA's baseline term of life plus 70 years, petitioners concede,  qualifies as a "limited Time" as applied to future copyrights. 4We note again that JUSTICE BREYER makes no such concession. See supra, at 2, n. 1. He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress' choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity. Moving beyond the bounds of the parties' presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress' entire product as irrational. Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not "limited." Petitioners' argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever "fixed" or "inalterable." The word "limited," however, does not convey a meaning so constricted. At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: "confined within certain bounds," "restrained," or "circumscribed." S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); see T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1796) ("confined within certain bounds");  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1312 (1976) ("confined within limits"; "restricted in extent, number, or duration"). Thus understood, a time span appropriately "limited" as applied to future copyrights does not automatically cease to be "limited" when applied to existing copyrights. And as we observe, infra, at 18, there is no cause to suspect that a  purpose to evade the "limited Times" prescription prompted Congress to adopt the CTEA.

To comprehend the scope of Congress' power under the Copyright Clause, "a page of history is worth a volume of logic." New York Trust Co. v. Eisner,256 U.S. 345, 349, 65 L. Ed. 963, 41 S. Ct. 506 (1921) (Holmes, J.). History reveals an unbroken congressional practice of granting to authors of works with existing copyrights the benefit of term extensions so that all under copyright protection will be governed evenhandedly under the same regime. As earlier recounted, see supra, at 3, the First Congress accorded the protections of the Nation's first federal copyright statute to existing and future works alike. 1790 Act § 1. 5This approach comported with English practice at the time. The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published. See ibid. ("The author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer."); ibid. ("The author of any book or books already printed . . . or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.").JUSTICE STEVENS stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers. Post, at 12, and n. 9. But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States. Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers' Company, "the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers." M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968). Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers' and publishers' entrenched position. See Rose, supra, at 52-56. In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was "intense" at the time of the founding, and "there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers' Company on the horizon." Nachbar, Constructing Copyright's Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002). The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in "Authors." JUSTICE STEVENS does not even attempt to explain how Parliament's response to England's experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress' power to extend copyrights granted to "Authors." Since then, Congress has regularly  applied  duration extensions  to both existing and future copyrights. 1831 Act §§ 1, 16; 1909 Act §§ 23-24; 1976 Act §§ 302-303; 17 U.S.C. §§ 302-304. 6Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant. The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work's publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term. § 1. Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes. See Stewart v. Abend,495 U.S. 207, 217, 109 L. Ed. 2d 184, 110 S. Ct. 1750 (1990) ("Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term."). Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant. See 1976 Act § 302(a); 17 U.S.C. § 302(a).

Because the Clause empowering Congress to confer copyrights also authorizes patents, congressional practice with respect to patents informs our inquiry. We count it significant that early Congresses extended the duration of numerous individual patents as well as copyrights. See, e.g., Act of Jan. 7, 1808, ch. 6, 6 Stat. 70 (patent); Act of Mar. 3, 1809, ch. 35, 6 Stat. 80 (patent); Act of Feb. 7, 1815, ch. 36, 6 Stat. 147 (patent); Act of May 24, 1828, ch. 145, 6 Stat. 389 (copyright); Act of Feb. 11, 1830, ch. 13, 6 Stat. 403 (copyright);  see generally Ochoa, Patent and Copyright Term Extension and the Constitution: A Historical Perspective, 49 J. Copyright Society 19 (2001). The courts saw no "limited Times" impediment to such extensions; renewed or extended terms were upheld in the early days, for example, by Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story sitting as circuit justices. See Evans v. Jordan, 8 F. Cas. 872, 874, F. Cas. No. 4564, F. Cas. No. 4564 (No. 4,564) (CC Va. 1813) (Marshall, J.) ("The construction of the constitution which admits the renewal of a patent is not controverted. A renewed patent . . . confers the same rights, with an original."), aff'd, Evans v. Jordan & Morehead, 13 U.S. 199, 9 Cranch 199, 3 L. Ed. 704 (1815); Blanchard v. Sprague, 3 F. Cas. 648, 650, F. Cas. No. 1518, F. Cas. No. 1518 (No. 1,518) (CC Mass. 1839) (Story, J.) ("I never have entertained any doubt of the constitutional authority of congress" to enact a 14-year patent extension that "operates retrospectively"); see also Evans v. Robinson, 8 F. Cas. 886, 888, F. Cas. No. 4571, F. Cas. No. 4571 (No. 4,571) (CC Md. 1813) (Congresses "have the exclusive right . . . to limit the times for which a patent right shall be granted, and are not restrained from renewing a patent or prolonging" it.). 7JUSTICE STEVENS would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,383 U.S. 1, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545, 86 S. Ct. 684 (1966), "flatly contradicts" them. Post, at 17. Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion. The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension. Graham addressed an invention's very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress' power to enlarge a patent's duration.

Further, although prior to the instant case this Court did not have occasion to decide whether extending the duration of  existing copyrights complies with the "limited Times" prescription, the Court has found no constitutional barrier to the legislative expansion of existing patents. 8JUSTICE STEVENS recites words from Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.,376 U.S. 225, 11 L. Ed. 2d 661, 84 S. Ct. 784, 1964 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 425 (1964), supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not "extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date," id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either. See post, at 1, 5. But Sears placed no reins on Congress' authority to extend a patent's life. The full sentence in Sears, from which JUSTICE STEVENS extracts words, reads: "Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents." 376 U.S., at 231. The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws. Ibid. ("[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly . . . [and] cannot . . . give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws."). A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.Also unavailing is JUSTICE STEVENS' appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison. Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of BREYER, J., post, at 5, 20. Respondent points to a better "demonstration," post, at 5, n. 3 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), of Madison's and other Framers' understanding of the scope of Congress' power to extend patents: "Then-President Thomas Jefferson -- the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers -- signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; . . . James Madison, who drafted the Constitution's 'limited Times' language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and . . . Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815." Brief for Respondent 15.McClurg v. Kingsland, 42 U.S. 202, 1 How. 202, 11 L. Ed. 102, (1843), is the pathsetting precedent. The patentee in that case was unprotected under the law in force when the patent issued because he had allowed his employer briefly to practice the invention before he obtained the patent. Only upon enactment, two years later, of an exemption for such allowances did the patent become valid, retroactive to the time it issued. McClurg upheld retroactive application of the new law. The Court explained that the legal regime governing a particular patent "depends on the law as it stood at the emanation of the patent, together with such changes as have been since made; for though they may be retrospective in their operation, that is not a sound objection to their validity." Id.,1 How. at 206. 9JUSTICE STEVENS reads McClurg to convey that "Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee." Post, at 19. But McClurg concerned no such change. To the contrary, as JUSTICE STEVENS acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee's employer did not invalidate the inventor's 1834 patent, "even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836." Post, at 18. In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee's rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of "such changes as had been since made." 1 How., at 206. It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent. Neither is it a sound  objection to the validity of a copyright term extension, enacted pursuant to the same constitutional grant of authority,  that the enlarged term covers existing copyrights.

Congress' consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: "Justice, policy, and equity alike forbid" that an "author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act." 7 Cong. Deb. 424 (1831); accord Symposium, The Constitutionality of Copyright Term Extension, 18 Cardozo Arts & Ent. L. J. 651, 694 (2000) (Prof. Miller) ("Since 1790, it has indeed been Congress's policy that the author of yesterday's  work should not get a lesser reward than the author of tomorrow's work just because Congress passed a statute lengthening the term today."). The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them. Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners' submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress' authority under the Copyright Clause.Satisfied that the CTEA complies with the "limited Times" prescription, we turn now to whether it is a rational exercise of the legislative authority conferred by the Copyright Clause. On that point, we defer substantially to Congress.  Sony, 464 U.S., at 429("It isCongress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of the limited monopoly that should be granted to authors . . . in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product."). 10JUSTICE BREYER would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments. Post, at 3. He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms "apparently" fails to achieve "significant" uniformity. Post, at 23. But see infra, at 15. The novelty of the "rational basis" approach he presents is plain. Cf.  Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,531 U.S. 356, 383, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866, 121 S. Ct. 955 (2001) (BREYER, J., dissenting) ("Rational-basis review -- with its presumptions favoring constitutionality -- is 'a paradigm of judicial restraint.'") (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,508 U.S. 307, 314, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211, 113 S. Ct. 2096 (1993)). Rather than subjecting Congress' legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that "it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve." Stewart v. Abend,495 U.S., at 230; see Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,464 U.S. 417, 429, 78 L. Ed. 2d 574, 104 S. Ct. 774 (1984). Congress' exercise of its Copyright Clause authority must be rational, but JUSTICE BREYER's stringent version of rationality is unknown to our literary property jurisprudence.



The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature's domain. As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37-38, a key factor in the CTEA's passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years. EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377-S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch). Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same  extended term. See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright § 5.3, p. 239 (2001). By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive  the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts. 11Responding to an inquiry whether copyrights could be extended "forever," Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters emphasized the dominant reason for the CTEA: "There certainly are proponents of perpetual copyright: We heard that in our proceeding on term extension. The Songwriters Guild suggested a perpetual term. However, our Constitution says limited times, but there really isn't a very good indication on what limited times is. The reason why you're going to life-plus-70 today is because Europe has gone that way . . . ." Copyright Term, Film Labeling, and Film Preservation Legislation: Hearings on H. R. 989 et al. before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 230 (1995) (hereinafter House Hearings). The CTEA may also provide greater incentive for American and other authors to create and disseminate their work in the United States. See Perlmutter, Participation in the International Copyright System as a Means to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts,  36 Loyola (LA) L. Rev. 323, 330 (2002) ("Matching the level of [copyright] protection in the United States [to that in the EU] can ensure stronger protection for U.S. works abroad and avoid competitive disadvantages vis-a-vis foreign rightholders."); see also id., at 332 (the United States could not "play a leadership role" in the give-and-take evolution of the international copyright system, indeed it would "lose all flexibility," "if the only way to promote the progress of science were to provide incentives to create new works"). 12The author of the law review article cited in text, Shira Perlmutter, currently a vice president of AOL Time Warner, was at the time of the CTEA's enactment Associate Register for Policy and International Affairs, United States Copyright Office.

In addition to international concerns, 13See also Austin, Does the Copyright Clause Mandate Isolationism?  26 Colum.-VLA J. L. & Arts 17, 59 (2002) (cautioning against "an isolationist reading of the Copyright Clause that is in tension with . . . America's international copyright relations over the last hundred or so years").Congress passed the CTEA in light of demographic, economic, and technological  changes, Brief for Respondent 25-26, 33, and nn. 23 and 24, 14Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents' average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure "the right to profit from licensing one's work during one's lifetime and to take pride and comfort in knowing that one's children -- and perhaps their children -- might also benefit from one's posthumous popularity." 141 Cong. Rec. 6553 (1995) (statement of Sen. Feinstein); see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch) ("Among the main developments [compelling reconsideration of the 1976 Act's term] is the effect of demographic trends, such as increasing longevity and the trend toward rearing children later in life, on the effectiveness of the life-plus-50 term to provide adequate protection for American creators and their heirs."). Also cited was "the failure of the U.S. copyright term to keep pace with the substantially increased commercial life of copyrighted works resulting from the rapid growth in communications media." Ibid. (statement of Sen. Hatch); cf.  Sony, 464 U.S., at 430-431 ("From its beginning, the law of copyright has developed in response to significant changes in technology . . . . As new developments have occurred in this country, it has been the Congress that has fashioned the new rules that new technology made necessary."). and rationally credited projections that longer terms would encourage copyright holders  to invest in the restoration and public distribution of their works, id., at 34-37; see H. R. Rep. No. 105-452, p. 4 (1998) (term extension "provides copyright owners generally with the incentive to restore older works and further disseminate them to the public"). 15JUSTICE BREYER urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to "move" any author with a "rational economic perspective." Post, at 14; see post, at 13-16. Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like "fashioning . . . new rules [in light of] new technology," Sony, 464 U.S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts. Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system's assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create. See, e.g., House Hearings 233-239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55-56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56-57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana). We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as JUSTICE BREYER acknowledges, reflects general "propositions about the value of incentives" that are "undeniably true." Post, at 14.Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA. According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works "could . . . provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works." House Hearings 158. "Authors would not be able to continue to create," the Register explained, "unless they earned income on their finished works. The public benefits not only from an author's original work but also from his or her further creations. Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary." Id., at 165.



In sum, we find that the CTEA is a rational enactment; we are not at liberty  to second-guess congressional determinations and policy judgments of this order, however debatable or arguably unwise they may be. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the CTEA -- which continues the unbroken congressional practice of treating future and existing copyrights in parity for term extension purposes -- is an impermissible exercise of Congress' power under the Copyright Clause.

B

Petitioners' Copyright Clause arguments rely on several novel readings of the Clause. We next address these arguments and explain why we find them unpersuasive.

1

Petitioners contend that even if the CTEA's 20-year term extension is literally a "limited Time," permitting Congress to extend existing copyrights allows it to evade the "limited Times" constraint by creating effectively perpetual copyrights through repeated extensions. We disagree.

As the Court of Appeals observed, a regime of perpetual copyrights "clearly is not the situation before us." 239 F.3d at 379. Nothing before this Court warrants construction of the CTEA's 20-year term extension as a congressional attempt to evade or override the "limited Times" constraint. 16JUSTICE BREYER agrees that "Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally" when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid. What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress? He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none. But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, JUSTICE BREYER's selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: "In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature's intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which 'represent the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.'" Garcia v. United States,469 U.S. 70, 76, 83 L. Ed. 2d 472, 105 S. Ct. 479 (1984) (quoting Zuber v. Allen,396 U.S. 168, 186, 24 L. Ed. 2d 345, 90 S. Ct. 314 (1969)). The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing. Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution "clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works," S. Rep. No. 104-315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid. Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA's passage spoke to similar effect. See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that "copyright protection should be for a limited time only" and that "perpetual protection does not benefit society").JUSTICE BREYER nevertheless insists that the "economic effect" of the CTEA is to make the copyright term "virtually perpetual." Post, at 1. Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright. Post, at 13-15. If JUSTICE BREYER's calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for -- under the same assumptions he indulges -- the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term. See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula). Indeed, on that analysis even the "limited" character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect. JUSTICE BREYER several times places the Founding Fathers on his side. See, e.g., post, at 5, 20. It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the "limited Times" prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar. Critically, we again emphasize, petitioners fail to  show how the CTEA crosses a constitutionally significant  threshold with respect to "limited Times" that the 1831, 1909, and 1976 Acts did not. See supra, at 3-5; Austin, supra, n. 13, at 56 ("If extending copyright protection to works already in existence is constitutionally suspect," so is "extending the protections of U. S. copyright law to works by foreign authors that had already been created and even first published when the  federal rights attached."). Those earlier Acts did not create perpetual copyrights, and neither does the CTEA. 17Respondent notes that the CTEA's life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term "resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities." Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18. Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of "limited Times" is not before us today. JUSTICE BREYER suggests that the CTEA's baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities. Post, at 15-16. The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years. Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA. If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

Petitioners dominantly advance a series of arguments all premised on the proposition that Congress may not extend an existing copyright absent new consideration from the author. They pursue this main theme under three headings. Petitioners contend that the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights (1) overlooks the requirement of "originality," (2) fails to "promote the Progress of Science," and (3) ignores copyright's quid pro quo.

 Petitioners'"originality" argument draws on Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.,499 U.S. 340, 113 L. Ed. 2d 358, 111 S. Ct. 1282(1991). In Feist, we observed that "the sine qua non of copyright is originality," id., at 345, and held that copyright protection is unavailable to "a narrow category of works in which the creative spark is utterly lacking or so trivial as to be virtually nonexistent," id., at 359. Relying on Feist, petitioners urge that even if a work is sufficiently "original" to qualify for copyright protection in the first instance, any extension of the copyright's duration is impermissible because, once published, a work is no longer original.

Feist, however, did not touch on the duration of copyright protection. Rather, the decision addressed the core question of copyrightability, i.e., the "creative spark" a work must have to be eligible for copyright protection at all. Explaining the originality requirement, Feist trained on the Copyright Clause words "Authors" and "Writings." Id., at 346-347. The decision did not construe the "limited Times" for which a work may be protected, and the originality requirement has no bearing on that prescription.

More forcibly, petitioners contend that the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights does not "promote the Progress of Science" as contemplated by the preambular language of the Copyright Clause. Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. To sustain this objection, petitioners do not argue that the Clause's preamble is an independently enforceable limit on Congress' power. See 239 F.3d at 378 (Petitioners acknowledge that "the preamble of the Copyright Clause is not a substantive limit on Congress' legislative power." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Rather, they maintain that the preambular language identifies the sole end to which Congress may legislate; accordingly, they conclude, the meaning of "limited Times" must be "determined in light of that specified end." Brief for Petitioners 19. The CTEA's extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to "promote the Progress of Science," petitioners argue, because it does not stimulate the  creation of new works but merely adds value to works already created.As petitioners point out, we have described the Copyright Clause as "both a grant of power and a limitation," Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,383 U.S. 1, 5, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545, 86 S. Ct. 684 (1966), and have said that "the primary objective of copyright" is "to promote the Progress  of Science," Feist, 499 U.S., at 349.The "constitutional command," we have recognized, is that Congress, to the extent it enacts copyright laws at all, create a "system" that "promotes the Progress of Science." Graham, 383 U.S., at 6. 18JUSTICE STEVENS' characterization of reward to the author as "a secondary consideration" of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the "Progress of Science." As we have explained, "the economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] Clause . . . is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors." Mazer v. Stein,347 U.S. 201, 219, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460, 1954 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 308 (1954). Accordingly, "copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge . . . . The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science." American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff'd, 60 F.3d 913 (CA2 1994). Rewarding authors for their creative labor and "promoting . . . Progress" are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright "the public good fully coincides . . . with the claims of individuals." The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). JUSTICE BREYER's assertion that "copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends" post, at 6, similarly misses the mark. The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.



We have also stressed, however, that it is generally for Congress,  not the courts, to decide how best to pursue the Copyright Clause's objectives. See Stewart v. Abend,495 U.S., at 230 ("The evolution of the duration of copyright protection tellingly illustrates the difficulties Congress faces . . . . It is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve."); Sony, 464 U.S., at 429 ("It is Congress that has been assigned the task of defining the scope of [rights] that should be granted to authors or to inventors in order to give the public appropriate access to their work product."); Graham, 383 U.S., at 6 ("Within the limits of the constitutional grant, the Congress may, of course, implement the stated purpose of the Framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim."). The justifications we earlier set out for Congress' enactment of the CTEA, supra, at 14-17, provide a rational basis for the conclusion that the CTEA "promotes the Progress of Science."

On the issue of copyright duration, Congress, from the start, has routinely applied new definitions or adjustments of the copyright term to both future works and existing works not yet in the public domain. 19As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed. They argue that by requiring authors seeking its protection to surrender whatever rights they had under state law, the 1790 Act enhanced uniformity and certainty and thus "promoted . . . Progress." See Brief for Petitioners 28-31. This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, that the First Congress understood it could "promote . . . Progress" by extending copyright protection to existing works. Every subsequent adjustment of copyright's duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding. Such consistent congressional practice is entitled to "very great weight, and when it is remembered that the rights thus established have not been disputed during a period of [over two] centuries, it is almost conclusive." Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony,111 U.S. 53, 57, 28 L. Ed. 349, 4 S. Ct. 279, 1884 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 186. Indeed, "this Court has repeatedly laid down the principle that a contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution when the founders of our Government and framers of our Constitution were actively participating in public affairs, acquiesced in for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given [the Constitution's] provisions." Myers v. United States,272 U.S. 52, 175, 71 L. Ed. 160, 47 S. Ct. 21, 62 Ct. Cl. 773 (1926). Congress' unbroken practice since the founding generation  thus overwhelms petitioners' argument that the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights fails per se to  "promote the Progress of Science." 20JUSTICE STEVENS, post, at 15, refers to the "legislative veto" held unconstitutional in INS v. Chadha,462 U.S. 919, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983), and observes that we reached that decision despite its impact on federal laws geared to our "contemporary political system," id., at 967 (White, J., dissenting). Placing existing works in parity with future works for copyright purposes, in contrast, is not a similarly pragmatic endeavor responsive to modern times. It is a measure of the kind Congress has enacted under its Patent and Copyright Clause authority since the founding generation. See supra, at 3-5.

Closely related to petitioners' preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause "imbeds a quid pro quo." Brief for Petitioners 23. They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an "Author" an "exclusive Right" for a "limited Time," but only in exchange for a "Writing." Congress' power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an "exclusive Right" for a "limited Time" in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter. Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the quid pro quo requirement.

 We can demur to petitioners' description of the Copyright Clause as a grant of legislative authority empowering Congress "to secure a bargain -- this for that." Brief for Petitioners 16; see Mazer v. Stein,347 U.S. 201, 219, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460, 1954 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 308 (1954) ("The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in 'Science and useful Arts.'"). But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails. Given the consistent placement of existing copyright  holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the "this" offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time. 21Standard copyright assignment agreements reflect this expectation. See, e.g., A. Kohn & B. Kohn, Music Licensing 471 (3d ed. 1992-2002) (short form copyright assignment for musical composition, under which assignor conveys all rights to the work, "including the copyrights and proprietary rights therein and in any and all versions of said musical composition(s), and any renewals and extensions thereof (whether presently available or subsequently available as a result of intervening legislation)" (emphasis added)); 5 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright § 21.11[B], p. 21-305 (2002) (short form copyright assignment under which assignor conveys all assets relating to the work, "including without limitation, copyrights and renewals and/or extensions thereof"); 6 id., § 30.04[B][1], p. 30-325 (form composer-producer agreement under which composer "assigns to Producer all rights (copyrights, rights under copyright and otherwise, whether now or hereafter known) and all renewals and extensions (as may now or hereafter exist)").Congress could rationally seek to "promote . . . Progress" by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term. Nothing in the Copyright Clause bars Congress from creating the same incentive by adopting the same position as a matter of unbroken  practice. See Brief for Respondent 31-32.

Neither Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.,376 U.S. 225, 11 L. Ed. 2d 661, 84 S. Ct. 784, 1964 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 425 (1964), nor Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,489 U.S. 141, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118, 109 S. Ct. 971 (1989), is to the contrary. In both cases, we invalidated the application of certain state laws as inconsistent with the federal patent regime. Sears, 376 U.S., at 231-233; Bonito, 489 U.S., at 152. Describing Congress' constitutional authority to confer patents, Bonito Boats noted: "The Patent Clause itself reflects a balance between the need to encourage innovation and the avoidance of monopolies which stifle competition without any concomitant advance in the 'Progress of Science and useful Arts.'" Id., at 146. Sears similarly stated that "patents are not given as favors . . . but are meant to encourage invention by rewarding the inventor with the right, limited to a term of years fixed by the patent, to exclude others from the use of his invention." 376 U.S., at 229. Neither case concerned the extension of a patent's duration. Nor did either suggest that such an extension might be constitutionally infirm. Rather, Bonito Boats reiterated the Court's unclouded understanding: "It is for Congress to determine if the present system" effectuates the goals of the Copyright and Patent Clause. 489 U.S., at 168. And as we have documented, see supra, at 10-13, Congress has many times sought to effectuate those goals by extending existing patents.

We note, furthermore, that patents and copyrights do not entail the same exchange, and that our references to a quid pro quo typically appear in the patent context. See, e.g., J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.,534 U.S. 124, 142, 151 L. Ed. 2d 508, 122 S. Ct. 593 (2001) ("The disclosure required by the Patent Act is 'the quid pro quo of the right to exclude.'" (quoting Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp.,416 U.S. 470, 484, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315, 94 S. Ct. 1879 (1974))); Bonito Boats, 489 U.S., at 161 ("the quid pro quo of substantial creative effort required by the federal [patent] statute"); Brenner v. Manson,383 U.S. 519, 534, 16 L. Ed. 2d 69, 86 S. Ct. 1033, 1966 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 74 (1966) ("The basic quid pro quo . . . for granting a patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility."); Pennock v. Dialogue,2 Pet. 1, 23, 27 U.S. 1, 7 L. Ed. 327 (1829) (If an invention is already commonly known and used when the patent is sought, "there might be sound reason for presuming, that the legislature did not intend to grant an exclusive right," given the absence of a "quid pro quo."). This is understandable, given that immediate disclosure is not the objective of, but is exacted from, the patentee. It is the price paid for the exclusivity secured. See J. E. M. Ag Supply, 534 U.S., at 142. For the author seeking copyright protection, in contrast, disclosure is the desired objective, not something exacted from the author in exchange for the copyright.  Indeed, since the  1976 Act, copyright has run from creation, not publication. See 1976 Act § 302(a); 17 U.S.C. § 302(a).

Further distinguishing the two  kinds of intellectual property, copyright gives the holder no monopoly on any knowledge. A reader of an author's writing may make full use of any fact or idea she acquires from her reading. See § 102(b). The grant of a patent, on the other hand, does prevent full use by others of the inventor's knowledge. See Brief for Respondent 22; Alfred Bell & Co. v. Catalda Fine Arts, 191 F.2d 99, 103, n. 16 (CA2 1951) (The monopoly granted by a copyright "is not a monopoly of knowledge. The grant of a patent does prevent full use being made of knowledge, but the reader of a book is not by the copyright laws prevented from making full use of any information he may acquire from his reading." (quoting W. Copinger, Law of Copyright 2 (7th ed. 1936))). In light of these distinctions, one cannot extract from language in our patent decisions -- language not trained on a grant's duration -- genuine support for petitioners' bold view. Accordingly, we reject the proposition that a quid pro quo requirement stops Congress from expanding copyright's term in a manner that puts  existing and future copyrights in parity. 22The fact that patent and copyright involve different exchanges does not, of course, mean that we may not be guided in our "limited Times" analysis by Congress' repeated extensions of existing patents. See supra, at 10-13. If patent's quid pro quo is more exacting than copyright's, then Congress' repeated extensions of existing patents without constitutional objection suggests even more strongly that similar legislation with respect to copyrights is constitutionally permissible.

 3

As an alternative to their various arguments that extending existing copyrights violates the Copyright Clause per se, petitioners urge heightened judicial review of such extensions to ensure that they appropriately pursue the purposes of the Clause. See Brief for Petitioners 31-32. Specifically,  petitioners ask us to apply the "congruence and proportionality" standard described in cases evaluating exercises of Congress' power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., City of Boerne v. Flores,521 U.S. 507, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997). But we have never applied that standard outside the § 5 context; it does not hold sway for judicial review of legislation enacted, as copyright laws are, pursuant to Article I authorization.

Section 5 authorizes Congress to enforce commands contained in and incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. Amdt. 14, § 5 ("The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." (emphasis added)). The Copyright Clause, in contrast, empowers Congress to define the scope of the substantive right. See Sony,464 U.S., at 429. Judicial deference to such congressional definition is "but a corollary to the grant to Congress of any Article I power." Graham, 383 U.S., at 6. It would be no more appropriate for us to subject the CTEA to "congruence and proportionality" review under the Copyright Clause than it would be for us to hold the Act unconstitutional per se.

For the several reasons stated, we find no Copyright Clause impediment to the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights.

III

Petitioners separately argue  that the CTEA is a content-neutral regulation of speech that fails heightened judicial review under the First Amendment. 23Petitioners originally framed this argument as implicating the CTEA's extension of both existing and future copyrights. See Pet. for Cert. i. Now, however, they train on the CTEA's extension of existing copyrights and urge against consideration of the CTEA's First Amendment validity as applied to future copyrights. See Brief for Petitioners 39-48; Reply Brief 16-17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-13. We therefore consider petitioners' argument as so limited. We note, however, that petitioners do not explain how their First Amendment argument is moored to the prospective/retrospective line they urge us to draw, nor do they say whether or how their free speech argument applies to copyright duration but not to other aspects of copyright protection, notably scope. We reject petitioners'  plea for imposition of uncommonly strict scrutiny on a copyright scheme that incorporates its own speech-protective purposes and safeguards. The Copyright Clause and First Amendment were adopted close in time. This proximity indicates that, in the Framers' view, copyright's limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles. Indeed, copyright's purpose is to promote the creation and publication of free expression. As Harper & Row observed: "The Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression. By establishing a marketable right to the use of one's expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas." 471 U.S., at 558.

In addition to spurring the creation and publication of new expression, copyright law contains built-in First Amendment accommodations.  See id., at 560. First, it distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter  eligible for copyright protection. Specifically, 17 U.S.C. § 102(b) provides: "In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work." As we said in Harper & Row, this "idea/expression dichotomy strikes a definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author's expression." 471 U.S., at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted). Due to this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication. See Feist, 499 U.S., at 349-350.Second, the "fair use" defense allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain circumstances. Codified at 17 U.S.C. § 107, the defense provides: "The fair use of a  copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies . . ., for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." The fair use defense affords considerable "latitude for scholarship and comment," Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 560, and even for parody, see Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.,510 U.S. 569, 127 L. Ed. 2d 500, 114 S. Ct. 1164 (1994) (rap group's musical parody of Roy Orbison's "Oh, Pretty Woman" may be fair use).The CTEA itself supplements these traditional First Amendment safeguards. First, it allows libraries, archives, and similar institutions to "reproduce" and "distribute, display, or perform in facsimile or digital form" copies of certain published works "during the last 20 years of any term of copyright . . . for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research" if the work is not already being exploited commercially and further copies are unavailable at a reasonable price.  17 U.S.C. § 108(h); see Brief for Respondent 36. Second, Title II of the CTEA, known as the  Fairness in Music Licensing Act of 1998, exempts small businesses, restaurants, and like entities from having to pay performance royalties on music played from licensed radio, television, and similar facilities.  17 U.S.C. § 110(5)(B); see Brief for Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr., et al. as Amici Curiae 5-6, n. 3.

Finally, the case petitioners principally rely upon for their First Amendment argument, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,512 U.S. 622, 129 L. Ed. 2d 497, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994), bears little on copyright. The statute at issue in Turner required cable operators to carry and transmit broadcast stations through their proprietary cable systems. Those "must-carry" provisions, we explained, implicated "the heart of the First Amendment," namely, "the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence." Id., at 641.  The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another's speech against the carrier's will. Instead, it protects authors' original expression from unrestricted exploitation. Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas. The First Amendment securely protects the freedom to make -- or decline to make -- one's own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people's speeches. To the extent such assertions raise First Amendment concerns, copyright's built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address them. We recognize that the D. C. Circuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights "categorically immune from challenges under the First Amendment." 239 F.3d at 375. But when, as in this case, Congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright protection, further First Amendment scrutiny is unnecessary. See Harper & Row, 471 U.S., at 560; cf.  San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm.,483 U.S. 522, 97 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 2971 (1987). 24We are not persuaded by petitioners' attempt to distinguish Harper & Row on the ground that it involved an infringement suit rather than a declaratory action of the kind here presented. As respondent observes, the same legal question can arise in either posture. See Brief for Respondent 42. In both postures, it is appropriate to construe copyright's internal safeguards to accommodate First Amendment concerns. Cf.  United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,513 U.S. 64, 78, 130 L. Ed. 2d 372, 115 S. Ct. 464 (1994) ("It is . . . incumbent upon us to read the statute to eliminate [serious constitutional] doubts so long as such a reading is not plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.").



  IV

If petitioners' vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA's duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works. Indeed, petitioners' assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA's enlarged terms invalid even as to  tomorrow's work. The 1976 Act's time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

As we read the Framers' instruction, the Copyright Clause empowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body's judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause. See Graham, 383 U.S., at 6 (Congress may "implement the stated purpose of the Framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim." (emphasis added)). Beneath the facade of their inventive constitutional interpretation, petitioners forcefully urge that Congress pursued very bad policy in prescribing the CTEA's long terms. The wisdom of Congress' action, however, is not within our province to second guess. Satisfied that the legislation before us remains inside the domain the Constitution assigns to the First Branch, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.

The Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (Coal Act or Act) includes the present 26 U.S.C. § 9706(a), providing generally that the Commissioner of Social Security "shall, before October 1, 1993," assign each coal industry retiree eligible for benefits to an extant operating company or a "related" entity, which shall then be responsible for funding the assigned beneficiary's benefits. The question is whether an initial assignment made after that date is valid  despite its untimeliness. We hold that it is. 

 I

We have spoken about portions of the Coal Act in two recent cases, Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 151 L. Ed. 2d 908, 122 S. Ct. 941 (2002), and Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498, 141 L. Ed. 2d 451, 118 S. Ct. 2131 (1998), the first of which sketches the Act's history, Barnhart, 534 U.S., at 442-447. Here, it is enough to recall that in its current form the Act requires the Commissioner to assign, where possible, every coal industry retiree to a "signatory operator," defined as a signatory of a coal wage agreement specified in § 9701(b)(1). §§ 9701(c)(1), 9706(a). An assignment should turn on a retiree's employment history with a particular operator, § 9706(a), unless an appropriate signatory is no longer in business, in which case the proper assignee is a "related person" of that operator, defined in terms of corporate associations and relationships not in issue here, § 9701(c)(2). 1The Coal Act's definition of "related persons" was the subject of our opinion last Term in Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 151 L. Ed. 2d 908, 122 S. Ct. 941 (2002). For simplicity, we will not refer to related persons separately in the balance of this opinion. The Act recognizes that some retirees will be "unassigned." § 9704(d).

  Assignment to a signatory operator binds the operator to pay an annual premium to the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund, established under the Act to administer benefits. § 9702. The premium has up to three components, starting with a "health benefit premium," computed by multiplying the number of assigned retirees by the year's "per beneficiary" premium, set by the Commissioner and based on the Combined Fund's health benefit expenses for the prior year, adjusted for changes in the Consumer Price Index. § 9704(b). The second element is a "death benefit premium" for projected benefits to the retirees' survivors, the premium being the operator's share of "the amount, actuarially determined, which the Combined Fund will be required to pay during the plan year for death benefits coverage." § 9704(c).

 A possible third constituent of the premium is for retirees who are not assigned to a particular operator, whose health and death benefits are nonetheless paid from the Combined Fund as if they were assigned beneficiaries. Before passage of the Coal Act, many operators withdrew from coal wage agreements, shifting the costs of paying for their retirees' benefits to the remaining signatories, Sigmon Coal Co., supra, at 444, and an important object of the Coal Act was providing stable funding for the health benefits of these "orphan retirees," House Committee on Ways and Means, Development and Implementation of the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (Comm. Print 1995) (hereinafter Coal Act Implementation). See Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-486, § 19142, 106 Stat. 3037 (intent to "stabilize plan funding" and "provide for the continuation of a privately financed self-sufficient program").

Before signatory operators may be compelled to contribute for the benefit of unassigned beneficiaries, however, funding from two other sources must run out. The United Mine Workers of America 1950  Pension  Plan (UMWA Pension Plan) was required to make three substantial payments to the Combined Fund for this purpose on February 1, 1993, October 1, 1993, and October 1, 1994. § 9705(a)(1). The Act also calls for yearly payments to the Combined Fund from the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund (AML Fund), established for reclamation and restoration of land and water resources degraded by coal mining.  30 U.S.C. § 1231(c).  Annual transfers from this AML Fund are limited to the greater of $ 70 million and the annual interest earned by the fund, and are subject to an aggregate limit equal to the amount of interest earned on the AML Fund between September 30, 1992, and October 1, 1995. §§ 1232(h)(2), (3)(B).

So far, these transfers from the UMWA Pension Plan and the AML Fund have covered the benefits of all unassigned beneficiaries. If they fall short, however, the third source comes into play (and the third element of an operator's Combined  Fund premium becomes actual): all assignee operators (that is, operators with assigned retirees) will have to pay an "unassigned beneficiaries premium," being their applicable percentage portion of the amount needed to pay annual benefits for the unassigned. An operator's "applicable percentage" is defined as "the percentage determined by dividing the number of eligible beneficiaries assigned under section 9706 to such operator by the total number of eligible beneficiaries assigned under section 9706 to all such operators (determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993)." 26 U.S.C. § 9704(f)(1). The signatory with the most assigned retirees thus would cover the greatest share of the benefits payable to the unassigned (as well as their spouses and certain dependants). 2According to a 1995 congressional Report, the total premium for a single beneficiary was $ 2,349.38 for the 1995 fiscal year. This figure includes only the health and death benefit premiums, since no unassigned beneficiaries premium has yet been charged. Coal Act Implementation 32-33. The 2002 per-beneficiary premium was approximately $ 2,725. General Accounting Office Report No. 02-243, Retired Coal Miners' Health Benefit Funds: Financial Challenges Continue 8 (Apr. 2002).

II

Although § 9706 provides that the Commissioner "shall" complete all assignments before October 1, 1993, the Commissioner did not, and she now estimates that some 10,000 beneficiaries were first assigned to signatory operators after the statutory date. The parties disagree on the reason the Commissioner failed to meet the deadline, but that dispute need not be resolved here. 3The Commissioner's proffered reason for the delay is that the Social Security Administration (SSA) was not permitted to expend appropriated funds to commence work on assignments until July 13, 1993, when Congress enacted the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103-50, 107 Stat. 254. The Commissioner also states that the task of researching employment records for approximately 80,000 coal industry workers in order to determine the appropriate signatory operators was monumental and could not have been completed by October 1, 1993, without additional resources. The respondent companies counter that the Acting Commissioner assured Congress less than a month before the statutory date that SSA would meet its "statutory responsibility" to complete the assignments on time. Hearing on Provisions Relating to the Health Benefits of Retired Coal Miners before the House Ways and Means Committee, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1993) (hereinafter 1993 Coal Act Hearing), Ser. No. 103-59, p. 26 (Comm. Print 1994) (statement of Acting Commissioner Thompson). The same representative informed Congress in 1995 that SSA had "completed the process of making the initial assignment decisions by October 1, 1993, as required by law." Hearing on the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the House Committee on Ways and Means, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 23 (1995), Ser. No. 104-67, p. 23 (1997) (statement of Principal Deputy Commissioner Thompson).

  After October 1, 1993, the Commissioner assigned 330 beneficiaries  to respondents Peabody Coal Company and  Eastern Associated Coal Corp., and a total of 270 beneficiaries to respondents Bellaire Corporation, NACCO Industries, Inc., and The North American Coal Corporation. These companies challenged the assignments in two separate actions before different District Courts, claiming that the statutory date sets a time limit on the Commissioner's power to assign, so that a beneficiary not assigned on October 1, 1993 (and the beneficiary's eligible dependants) must be left unassigned for life. If the respondent companies are right, the challenged assignments are void and the corresponding benefits must be financed not by them, but by the transfers from the UMWA Pension Plan and the AML Fund and, if necessary, by unassigned beneficiary premiums paid by other signatory operators to whom timely assignments were made.

The Commissioner denied that Congress intended the Commissioner's tardiness in assignments to impose a permanent charge on the public AML Fund, otherwise earmarked for reclamation, or to raise the threat of permanently heavier financial burdens on companies that happened to get assignments before October 1, 1993. The Commissioner argued that Congress primarily intended coal operators to pay for their own retirees. The trustees of the Combined Fund intervened  in one of the cases and took the Commissioner's view that initial assignments made after September 30, 1993, are valid. 4The General Accounting Office estimated in 2000 that invalidation of assignments made after September 30, 1993, could require the Combined Fund to refund $ 57 million in premium payments. Letter of Gloria L. Jarmon to Hon. William V. Roth, Jr., Senate Committee on Finance, 2 (Aug. 15, 2000), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/ai00267r.pdf (as visited Jan. 9, 2003) (available in Clerk of Court's case file).

The companies obtained summary judgments in each case, on the authority of Dixie Fuel Co. v. Commissioner of Social Security, 171 F.3d 1052 (CA6 1999), which went against the Commissioner on the issue here. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed in two opinions likewise following Dixie Fuel -- Peabody Coal Co. v. Massanari, 14 Fed. Appx. 393 (2001), and Bellaire Corp. v. Massanari, 14 Fed. Appx. 424 (2001) -- but conflicting with the Fourth Circuit's holding in Holland v. Pardee Coal Co., 269 F.3d 424 (2001). We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 5After the grant of certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit came down on the side of the Fourth Circuit. See Shenango Inc. v. Apfel, 307 F.3d 174 (2002).534 U.S. 1112, 151 L. Ed. 2d 883, 122 S. Ct. 918 (2002), and now reverse.

III

It misses the point simply to argue that the October 1, 1993, date was "mandatory," "imperative," or a "deadline," as of course it was, however unrealistic the mandate may have been. The Commissioner had no discretion to choose to leave  assignments until after the prescribed date, and the assignments in issue here represent a default on a statutory duty, though it may well be a wholly blameless one. But the failure to act on schedule merely raises the real question, which is what the consequence of tardiness should be. The respondent companies call the failure "jurisdictional," such that the affected beneficiaries (like truly orphan beneficiaries) may never be assigned, but instead must be permanent  wards of the UMWA Pension Plan, the AML Fund, and, potentially, of coal operators without prior relationship to these beneficiaries. The companies, in other words, say that as to tardily assigned beneficiaries who were, perhaps, formerly their own employees, they go scot free. We think the claim is as unsupportable as it is counterintuitive.

A

First there is the companies' position that couching the duty in terms of the mandatory "shall" together with a specific  deadline leaves the Commissioner with no authority to make an initial assignment on or after October 1, 1993. We rejected a comparable argument in Brock v. Pierce County,476 U.S. 253, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248, 106 S. Ct. 1834 (1986), dealing with the power of the Secretary of Labor to audit a grant recipient under a provision that he "'shall' issue a final determination . . . within 120 days" of receiving a complaint alleging misuse of federal grant funds. Id., at 255. Like the Court of Appeals here, the Ninth Circuit in Brock thought the mandate and deadline together implied that Congress "had intended to prevent the Secretary from acting" after the statutory period, id., at 257. We, on the contrary, expressed reluctance "to conclude that every failure of an agency to observe a procedural requirement voids subsequent agency action, especially when important public rights are at stake," id., at 260, and reversed. As in this litigation, the Secretary's responsibility in Brock was "substantial," the "ability to complete it within 120 days [was] subject to factors beyond [the Secretary's] control," and "the Secretary's delay, under respondent's theory, would prejudice the rights of the taxpaying public." Id., at 261. We accordingly read the 120-day provision as meant "to spur the Secretary to action, not to limit the scope of his authority," so that untimely action was still valid.  Id., at 265.

 Nor, since Brock, have we ever construed a provision that the Government "shall" act within a specified time, without more, as a jurisdictional limit precluding action later. Thus,  a provision that a detention hearing "'shall be held immediately upon the [detainee's] first appearance before the judicial officer'" did not bar detention after a tardy hearing, United States v. Montalvo-Murillo,495 U.S. 711, 714, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720, 110 S. Ct. 2072 (1990) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)), and a mandate that the Secretary of Health and Human Services "'shall report'" within a certain time did "not mean that [the] official lacked power to act beyond it," Regions Hospital v. Shalala,522 U.S. 448, 459, n. 3, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895, 118 S. Ct. 909 (1998).

We have summed up this way: "if a statute does not  specify a consequence for noncompliance with statutory timing provisions, the federal courts will not in the ordinary course impose their own coercive sanction." United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,510 U.S. 43, 63, 126 L. Ed. 2d 490, 114 S. Ct. 492 (1993). 6No one could disagree with JUSTICE SCALIA that "when a power is conferred for a limited time, the automatic consequence of the expiration of that time is the expiration of the power," post, at 4 (dissenting opinion), but his assumption that the Commissioner's power to assign retirees was "conferred for a limited time" assumes away the very question to be decided. JUSTICE SCALIA's dissent is an elaboration on this circularity, forever returning as it must to his postulate that § 9706(a) constitutes a "time-limited mandate" that "expired" on the statutory date. Post, at 6-7.JUSTICE SCALIA's closest approach to a nonconclusory justification for his position is the assertion of an entirely formal interpretive rule that a date figuring in the same statutory subsection as the creation of a mandatory obligation ipso facto negates any power of tardy performance. Post, at 5-7. JUSTICE SCALIA cites no authority for his formalism, which is contradicted by United States v. Montalvo-Murillo, 495 U.S. 711, 109 L. Ed. 2d 720, 110 S. Ct. 2072 (1990), where a single statutory subsection provided that a judicial officer "shall hold a hearing" and that "the hearing shall be held immediately upon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer." Id., at 714 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)). Conversely, Brock v. Pierce County,476 U.S. 253, 90 L. Ed. 2d 248, 106 S. Ct. 1834 (1986), United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property,510 U.S. 43, 126 L. Ed. 2d 490, 114 S. Ct. 492 (1993), and Regions Hospital v. Shalala,522 U.S. 448, 139 L. Ed. 2d 895, 118 S. Ct. 909 (1998), ascribed no significance to the formal placement of the time limitation. One can only ask why a statute providing that "The obligor shall perform its duty before October 1, 1993," should be thought to differ fundamentally from one providing that "(i) The obligor shall perform its duty. (ii) The obligor's duty shall be performed before October 1, 1993." The accepted fact is that some time limits are jurisdictional even though expressed in a separate statutory section from jurisdictional grants, see, e. g., 28 U.S.C. § 1291 (providing that the courts of appeals "shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States"); § 2107 (providing that notice of appeal in civil cases must be filed "within thirty days after the entry of such judgment"); Browder v. Director, Dep't of Corrections,434 U.S. 257, 264, 54 L. Ed. 2d 521, 98 S. Ct. 556 (1978) (stating that the limitation in § 2107 is "'mandatory and jurisdictional'" (citation omitted)), while others are not, even when incorporated into the jurisdictional provision, see, e. g., Montalvo-Murillo, supra.Formalistic rules do not account for the difference, which is explained by contextual and historical indications of what Congress meant to accomplish. Here that intent is revealed in several obvious ways: in rules that define an operator's liability in terms of employment history, see § 9706(a), in appellate rights to test the appropriateness of an initial assignment, see infra, at 16-17, and in the expressed understanding that the companies that got the benefit of a worker's labor should pay for the worker's benefits, see infra, at 14-16. What else, after all, would anyone naturally expect? As opposed to the sensible indications that the initial assignment deadline was not meant to be jurisdictional, JUSTICE SCALIA's new formal rule would thwart the statute's object and relieve the respondent companies of all responsibility, which other, less lucky operators might be required to shoulder. There undoubtedly was much political compromise in the development of the Coal Act, but politics does not justify turning the process of initial assignment into a game of chance.

Hence the oddity at this date of a claim that late official action should shift financial burdens from otherwise responsible private purses to the public fisc, let alone siphon money from funds set aside expressly for a different public purpose, like the AML Fund for land reclamation. The point would be the same, however, even if Brock were the only case on the subject. The Coal Act was adopted six years after Brock came down, when Congress was presumably aware that we do not readily infer congressional intent to limit an agency's power to get a mandatory job done merely from a specification to act by a certain time.  See United States v. Wells,519 U.S. 482, 495, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997). 7The respondent companies attempt to distinguish Brock because we noted in that case that an aggrieved party could sue under the Administrative Procedure Act to "'compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,'" 476 U.S., at 260, n. 7 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(1)). The companies assert that no such remedy would have applied to the Commissioner's duty under § 9706(a). Whether or not this is the case, the companies do not argue that they were aggrieved by the failure to assign retirees by the statutory date. On the contrary, they temporarily avoided payment of premium amounts for which they would indisputably have been liable had the assignments been timely made. It therefore does not appear that there was a need to provide operators "with any remedy at all -- much less the drastic remedy respondents seek in this case -- for the [Commissioner's] failure to meet the [October 1, 1993] deadline." 476 U.S., at 260, n. 7.The Brock example consequently  has to mean that a statute directing official action needs more than a mandatory "shall" before the grant of power can sensibly be read to expire when the job is supposed to be done. Nothing so limiting, however, is to be found in the Coal Act: no express language supports the companies, while structure, purpose, and legislative history go against them.

Structural clues support the Commissioner in the Coal Act's other instances of combining the word "shall" with a specific date that could not possibly be read to prohibit action outside the statutory period. Congress, for example, provided that the UMWA Pension Plan "shall transfer to the Combined Fund" installments of $ 70 million on February 1, 1993, on October 1, 1993, and on October 1, 1994. § 9705(a)(1). It could not be that a failure to make a transfer on one of those precise dates, for whatever reason, would have left the UMWA Pension Plan with no authority to make the payment; October 1, 1994, was not even a business day. Or consider the Act's mandatory provisions that the trustees of the Combined Fund "shall" be designated no later than 60 days from the enactment date, § 9702(a)(1), and that the  designated trustees "shall, not later than 60 days after the enactment date," give the Commissioner certain information about benefits, § 9704(h). No one could seriously argue that the entire scheme would have been nullified if appointments had been left to the 61st day, or that trustees (whose appointments  could properly have been left to the 60th day) were powerless to divulge information to the SSA after the 60-day period had expired. 8JUSTICE SCALIA concedes that his theory should not extend so far as to limit the UMWA Pension Plan's duty to transfer funds to the Combined Fund to the particular dates in § 9705(a)(1). JUSTICE SCALIA attempts to avoid such an outcome by assuming, without basis, that the "UMWA Pension Plan has the power to transfer funds" to the Combined Fund in the absence of the authorization in § 9705(a)(1). Post, at 5 (dissenting opinion). JUSTICE SCALIA's confidence is misplaced. Prior to the Coal Act's enactment, the Vice Chairman of the Secretary of Labor's Coal Commission testified before Congress that legislative authorization was needed for such a transfer to occur: "One of the things that concerned the Commission was, first of all, our understanding of the present state of law under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Under that Act it is not within the power of any of the participants or signatories to transfer a pension surplus to a benefit fund. That is one of the reasons for the recommendation that a transfer be authorized." Hearing before the Subcommittee on Medicare and Long-Term Care of the Senate Committee on Finance, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 13 (1991) (statement of Coal Commission Vice Chairman Perritt). It appears, then, that § 9705(a)(1) provides both the UMWA Pension Plan's power to act and a time limit, which according to JUSTICE SCALIA would render action on any other date ultra vires, a result that even the dissent does not embrace.



JUSTICE SCALIA thinks it "debatable" that the power to appoint initial trustees survives the deadline in § 9702(a)(1). Post, at 7. In order to avoid the embarrassment of concluding that tardiness would remove all authority to appoint the initial trustees, which would render the Act a dead letter, he suggests that an initial trustee could be appointed under § 9702(b)(2), even though that provision applies only to appointment of a "successor trustee" to be made "in the same manner as the trustee being succeeded," whereas an initial trustee does not "succeed" anyone. The extreme implausibility of JUSTICE SCALIA's suggested reading of § 9702(b)(2) points up the unreasonableness of placing a jurisdictional gloss on the § 9706(a) time limitation. It is impossible to believe that Congress meant its Herculean effort to resolve the coal industry benefit crisis to come to absolutely nothing if trustees were designated late.



There is a basic lesson to be learned from JUSTICE SCALIA's contortions to avoid the untoward results flowing from his formalistic theory that time limits on mandatory official action are always jurisdictional when they occur in an authorizing provision. The lesson is that something is very wrong with the theory.

In each of these instances, we draw a conclusion on grounds of  plausibility: if Congress had meant to set a counterintuitive limit on authority to act, it would have said more than it did, and would surely not have couched its intent in language Brock had already held to lack any clear jurisdictional significance. The same may be said here.

B

Nor do we think the result of appealing to plausibility is affected by either of two other textual features that the companies take as indicating inability to assign beneficiaries after the statutory date: the provision for unassigned beneficiary status itself, and the provision that an operator's contribution for the benefit of the unassigned shall be calculated "on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993." §§ 9704(f)(1), (2).

1

The companies characterize the provision for unassigned beneficiaries as the specification of a "consequence" for failure to assign a beneficiary to an operator or related person. Cf.  Brock, 476 U.S., at 259. Specifying this consequence of failure, they say, shows that the failure must be governed by the consequence provided, not corrected by a tardy assignment corresponding to one that should have been made earlier. The specified consequence, in other words, reflects a  legislative preference for finality over accurate initial assignments and creates a right on the part of the companies to rely permanently on the state of affairs as they were on October 1, 1993. We think this line of reasoning is unsound at every step.

To begin with, whatever might be inferable from the fact that a specific provision addressed the failure to make a  timely assignment, the part of the Act referring to "unassigned" beneficiaries is not any such provision. The Act speaks of the beneficiaries not in terms of the Commissioner's failure to assign them in time, but simply as "beneficiaries who are not assigned." § 9704(d). The most obvious reason for beneficiaries' being unassigned, in fact, is the disappearance of a beneficiary's former employer, leaving no signatory operator for assignment under § 9706(a). This is not to say that failure of timely assignment does not also leave a beneficiary "unassigned" under the Act. It simply means that  unassigned status has no significance peculiar to failure of timely assignment.

Second, to the extent that "unassigned" status is a consequence of mere untimeliness, there would be a far more obvious reason for specifying that consequence than a supposed desire for finality. 9Many "consequences," of course, are intended to induce an obligated person to take untimely action rather than bar that action altogether. Section 9704(i)(1)(C), for example, denies certain tax deductions to operators who fail to make contributions during specified periods, and § 9707(a) provides a penalty for operators who fail to pay premiums on time. The first consequence is eliminated when the operator takes action that is necessarily untimely, and the second penalty ceases to run when the premiums are paid, albeit out of time. On its face, the provision for a beneficiary left out through tardiness functions simply as a default rule to provide coverage under the new regime required to be in place by October 1, 1993; there had to be some source of funding for every beneficiary by then, and provisions for the "unassigned" employees tell the SSA what the source will be in the absence of any other. But we do not read a provision apparently made for want of something better as an absolute command to forgo something better for all time.

In fact, it is unrealistic to think that Congress understood unassigned status as an enduring "consequence" of uncompleted work, for nothing indicates that Congress even foresaw that some beneficiaries matchable with operators still in  business might not be assigned before October 1, 1993. As the companies themselves point out, the Commissioner led Congress to believe as late as 1995 that all possible assignments had been made on time, see n. 3, supra, and such little legislative history as there is on the point tends to show that Congress assumed that any assignments that could be made at all (say, to an operator still in business) would be made on time. On October 8, 1992, on the heels of the Conference Committee Report on the Act and just before the vote in the Senate adopting the Act, Senator Wallop gave a detailed explanation of the Coal Act's provisions for unassigned beneficiaries, which assumed that the "unassigned" would be true orphans:"As a practical matter, not all beneficiaries can be assigned to a specific last signatory operator, related person or assigned operator for payment purposes. This is because in some instances, none of those persons remain in business,  even as defined to include non-mining related businesses. Thus, provisions are made for unassigned beneficiary premiums." 138 Cong. Rec. 34003 (1992).

The Senator's report says that the transfer to the Combined Fund from the UMWA Pension Plan and AML Fund would be made because "unassigned beneficiaries were not employed by the assigned operators at the time of their retirement . . . . If no operator remains in business under the formulations described above, that retiree becomes an unassigned beneficiary . . . .  [The Coal Act's] purpose is to assure that any beneficiary, once assigned, remains the responsibility of a particular operator, and that the number of unassigned beneficiaries is kept to  an absolute minimum." Ibid. 10Postenactment statements, though entitled to less weight, are to the same effect. At a hearing before the House Committee of Ways and Means on September 9, 1993, one member asked whether SSA had established procedures "to assure that beneficiaries are not improperly designated as unassigned." The Acting Commissioner of Social Security responded that employee training "emphasized that the intent of the Coal Act was to assign miners to mine operators if at all possible." 1993 Coal Act Hearing 46 (statements of Rep. Johnson and Acting Commissioner Thompson). The record of the hearing also contains a statement by the committee chairman that the Act required operators to "pay for their own retirees, and to assume a proportionate share of the liability for true 'orphans' -- retirees whose companies are no longer in existence and cannot pay for the benefits." Id., at 58. At no point did any witness suggest that the unassigned beneficiary system was intended for miners who could be assigned but were not assigned before October 1, 1993, or that such miners would remain unassigned in perpetuity in order to protect the status quo on that date. It seems not to have crossed Congress's mind that  the category of the "unassigned" would include beneficiaries, let alone a lot of beneficiaries, who could be connected with an operator, albeit late. Providing a consequence of default was apparently just happenstance. 11The respondent companies cite a postenactment statement by Representative Johnson that Congress had an obligation to "make sure that companies . . . have time to figure out their liability and prepare to deal with it." Id., at 42. The Representative's comment did not purport to interpret the Coal Act as adopted, however, but was made in discussing whether "there should be some resolution passed" to give coal operators more time to prepare for their Coal Act obligations. Ibid.One statement in Senator Wallop's preenactment report, which the companies do not cite, indicates an understanding that assignments would be fixed after October 1, 1993. See 138 Cong. Rec. 34003 (1992) ("The percentage of the unassigned beneficiary premiums allocable to each assigned operator on October 1, 1993 will remain fixed in future years"). As discussed, however, there is no indication that Congress foresaw that the Commissioner would be unable to complete assignments by the statutory date. A general statement made on the assumption that all assignments that could ever be made would be made before October 1, 1993, does not show a legislative preference for finality over accuracy now that that assumption has proven incorrect.

Congress plainly did, however, weigh finality on October 1, 1993, against accuracy of initial assignments in one circumstance, and accuracy won. Section 9704(d) speaks of "beneficiaries who are not assigned . . . for [any] plan year," suggesting  that assignment status may change from year to year. One way it may change is by correcting an erroneous assignment. Under the Act, an operator getting notice of an assignment has 30 days to request information regarding the basis of the assignment and then 30 days from receipt of that information to ask for reconsideration. §§ 9706(f)(1)-(2). If the Commissioner finds error, the Combined Fund trustees will fix it by reducing premiums and refunding any overpayments. § 9706(f)(3)(A)(i); see also § 9706(f)(3)(A)(ii). Nothing is said about finality on October 1, 1993, and no time limit whatever is imposed on the Commissioner's authority to reassign. The companies concede, as they must, that the statute permits reassignment after October 1, 1993.

The companies do, however, try to limit the apparent preference for accuracy by arguing that one feature of this provision for reconsideration in § 9706(f) implicitly supports them; this specific and isolated exception to an otherwise unequivocal bar to assignments after the statutory date suggests, they say, that the bar is  otherwise absolute. Again, we think no such conclusion follows.

First, the argument is circular; it assumes that the availability of the § 9706(f) reconsideration process with no time limit is an exception to a bar on all assignment  activity imposed by the October 1, 1993, time limit of § 9706(a). But the question, after all, is whether the October 1, 1993, mandate is in fact a bar. Section 9706(f) does not say it is, and nothing in that provision suggests it was enacted as an exception to the October 1, 1993, date. It has no language about operating notwithstanding the date specified in § 9706(a); on the contrary, it states that reassignment will be made "under subsection (a)," § 9706(f)(3)(A)(ii). But if the authority to reassign is contained in § 9706(a), then § 9706(f) is reasonably read not as lifting a jurisdictional time bar but simply as specifying a procedure for an aggrieved operator to follow in requesting the Commissioner to exercise the assignment power contained in § 9706(a) all along. In the combined  operation of the two subsections,  there is thus no implication that the Commissioner is powerless to make an initial assignment to an operator after the specified date; any suggestion goes the other way.

Second, there is no reason to read the provision in § 9706(f) for correction of erroneous assignments as implying that the Commissioner should not employ her § 9706(a) authority to make a tardy initial assignment in a situation like this. We do not read the enumeration of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.  United Dominion Industries, Inc. v. United States, 532 U.S. 822, 836, 150 L. Ed. 2d 45, 121 S. Ct. 1934 (2001). As we have held repeatedly, the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius does not apply to every statutory listing or grouping; it has force only when the items expressed are members of an "associated group or series," justifying the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice, not inadvertence.  United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65, 152 L. Ed. 2d 90, 122 S. Ct. 1043 (2002). We explained this point as recently as last Term's unanimous opinion in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 81, 153 L. Ed. 2d 82, 122 S. Ct. 2045 (2002):"Just as statutory language suggesting exclusiveness is missing, so is that essential extrastatutory ingredient of an expression-exclusion demonstration, the series of terms from which an omission bespeaks a negative implication. The canon depends on identifying a series of two or more terms or things that should be understood to go hand in hand, which [is] abridged in circumstances supporting a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded. E. Crawford, Construction of Statutes 337 (1940) (expressio unius "'properly applies only when in the natural association of ideas in the mind of the reader that which is expressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to that which is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmative inference'" (quoting State ex rel. Curtis v. De Corps, 134 Ohio St. 295, 299, 16 N.E.2d 459, 462 (1938))); United States v. Vonn, supra."

As in Echazabal, respondents here fail to show any reason that Congress would have considered reassignments after appeal "to go hand in hand" with tardy initial assignments. Since Congress apparently never thought that initial assignments would be late, see supra, at 14-16, the better inference is that what we face here is nothing more than a case unprovided for. 12There is, of course, no "'case unprovided for' exception" to the expressio unius canon, post, at 11 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). It is merely that the canon does not tell us that a case was provided for by negative implication unless an item unmentioned would normally be associated with items listed.The companies emphasize that § 9704(f)(2)(B) requires that beneficiaries whose operator goes out of business must be treated as unassigned and cannot be reassigned. Even assuming that a provision that goes to the definition of "applicable percentage" and does not directly implicate assignments has the effect the companies suggest, the most that could be said is that Congress wished to identify the first, most responsible operator for a given retiree, and not to follow that with a second assignment to a less responsible operator if the initial assigned operator left the business. This interest does not indicate an object of date-specific finality over accuracy in the first assignment; on the contrary, it opts for finality only once an accurate initial assignment has been made. In the absence of a more exact explanation for this arrangement, we suppose the explanation is good political horse trading. But provisions that by their terms govern after the initial assignment is made tell us nothing about the period in which an initial assignment may be made. In fact, the permissibility under § 9706(f) of postappeal reassignment after October 1, 1993, makes plain that Congress was not "insisting upon as perfect a match-up as possible up to October 1, 1993, and then prohibiting future changes, both by way of initial assignment or otherwise," post, at 13 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), as JUSTICE SCALIA himself agrees. On the contrary, the reassignment provision indicates that a system of accuracy "in initial assignments, whether made before the deadline or afterward," is precisely what the Act envisions. Ibid. Here, as throughout this opinion, "accuracy" refers not to an elusive system of "perfect fairness," ibid., but to assignments by the Commissioner following the scheme set out in §§ 9706(a)(1)-(3).

   2

The remaining textual argument for the companies' side rests on the definition of an operator's "applicable percentage" of the overall obligation of all assignee operators (or related persons) to fund benefits for the unassigned. Under § 9704(f)(1), it is defined as the percentage of the operator's own assigned beneficiaries among all assigned beneficiaries "determined on the basis of assignments as of October 1, 1993" (parenthesis omitted). The companies argue that the specification "as of " October 1, 1993, means that an assigned operator's percentage of potential liability for the benefit of the unassigned is fixed according to the assignments made at that date, subject only to specific exceptions set out in § 9704(f)(2), requiring a change in the percentage when erroneously assigned retirees are reassigned or assignee operators go out of business. The companies contend that their position rests on plain meaning: "as of " the date means "as assignments actually stand" on the date. Yet the words "as of," as used in the statute, can be read another way: since Congress required that all possible assignments be complete on October 1, 1993, see § 9706(a), it is equally fair to read assignments "as of " that date to mean "assignments as they shall be on that date, assuming the Commissioner complies with our command." The companies' reading is hospitable to early finality of assignments, while the alternative favors completeness and accuracy before finality prevails. 

Once it is seen that there is no "plain" reading, however, there is nothing left of the "as of " argument except its stress that the applicable percentage can be modified only in accordance with the two exceptions recognizing changes for initial error or the demise of an assignee operator. The answer to this point, of course, has already been given. The enunciation of two exceptions does not imply an exclusion of a third unless there is reason to think the third was at least considered, whereas there is good reason to conclude that when Congress adopted the language in question it did not  foresee a failure to make timely assignments. See supra, at 17-19. The phrase "as of " cannot be read to govern a situation that Congress clearly did not contemplate, 13The same may be said of the provision for an initial trustee to serve until November 1, 1993, § 9702(b)(3)(B), contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA's view. Post, at 11-12 (dissenting opinion). nor does it require the absolute finality of assignments urged by the companies.

 IV

IV This much is certain: the Coal Act rests on Congress's stated finding that it was necessary to "identify persons most responsible for plan liabilities," and on its express desire to "provide for the continuation of a privately financed self-sufficient program for the delivery of health care  benefits," Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-486, § 19142, 106 Stat. 3037. 14Under the respondent companies' view, if the transfers from the AML Fund prove insufficient to cover the benefits of all unassigned beneficiaries, an operator that received no assignments prior to October 1, 1993, would not have to contribute a penny to the unassigned beneficiary pool -- solely due to the Commissioner's fortuitous failure to make all assignments by the statutory deadline. At the same time, operators that received full assignments prior to October 1, 1993, would be forced to cover more than their fair share of unassigned beneficiaries' premiums.Although JUSTICE SCALIA sees the Act as rife with "seemingly unfair and inequitable provisions," post, at 12 (dissenting opinion), even his view is no reason to assume that Congress meant contested provisions to be construed in the most unfair and inequitable manner possible. In any event, JUSTICE SCALIA's citation of § 9704(f)(2)(B) does not help his position. It provides a clear statutory solution to a problem Congress anticipated: the end of an assigned operator's business. Had Congress propounded a response to the issue now before us as clear as § 9704(f)(2)(B), there would doubtless have been no split in the Courts of Appeals and no cases for us to review. Given the absence of an express provision, the statute's goals are best served by treating operators the way Congress intended them to be treated, that is, by allowing the Commissioner to identify the operators most responsible. In the words of Senator Wallop's report delivered shortly before enactment, the statute is "designed to allocate the greatest number of beneficiaries in the Plans to a prior  responsible operator. For this reason, definitions are intended by the drafters to be given broad interpretation to accomplish this goal." 138 Cong. Rec. 34001 (1992). 15A Congressional Research Service report dated shortly before the enactment likewise states that the Act envisioned that "wherever possible, responsibility for individual beneficiaries would be assigned . . . to a previous employer still in business." Coal Industry: Use of Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund Monies for UMWA "Orphan Retiree" Health Benefits (Sept. 10, 1992), reprinted in 138 Cong. Rec., at 34005. To accept the companies' argument that the specified date for action is jurisdictional would be to read the Act so as to allocate not the greatest, but the least, number of beneficiaries to  a responsible operator. The way to reach the congressional objective, however, is to read the statutory date as a spur to prompt action, not as a bar to tardy completion of the business of ensuring that benefits are funded, as much as possible, by those identified by Congress as principally responsible.

 The judgments of the Court of Appeals in both cases are accordingly

Reversed.  


JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.

We here consider the validity of a Ninth Circuit rule that a conspiracy ends automatically when the object of the conspiracy  becomes impossible to achieve -- when, for example, the Government frustrates a drug conspiracy's objective by seizing the drugs that its members have agreed to distribute. In our view, conspiracy law does not contain any such "automatic termination" rule.

I

In United States v. Cruz, 127 F.3d 791, 795 (CA9 1997), the Ninth Circuit, following the language of an earlier case, United States v. Castro, 972 F.2d 1107, 1112 (CA9 1992), wrote that a conspiracy terminates when "'there is affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal or defeat of the object of the conspiracy'" (emphasis added). It considered the conviction of an individual who, the Government had charged, joined a conspiracy (to distribute drugs) after the Government had seized the drugs in question. The Circuit found that the Government's seizure of the drugs guaranteed the "defeat" of the conspiracy's objective, namely, drug distribution. The Circuit held that the conspiracy had terminated with that "defeat," i.e., when the Government seized the drugs.  Hence the individual, who had joined the conspiracy after that point, could not be convicted as a conspiracy member.

In this case the lower courts applied the Cruz rule to similar facts: On November 18, 1997, police stopped a truck in Nevada. They found, and seized, a large stash of illegal drugs. With the help of the truck's two drivers, they set up a sting. The Government took the truck to the drivers' destination, a mall in Idaho. The drivers paged a contact and described the truck's location. The contact said that he would call someone to get the truck. And three hours later, the two defendants, Francisco Jimenez Recio and Adrian Lopez-Meza, appeared in a car. Jimenez Recio drove away in the truck; Lopez-Meza drove the car away in a similar  direction. Police stopped both vehicles and arrested both men.

A federal grand jury indicted Jimenez Recio, Lopez-Meza, and the two original truck drivers, charging them with having conspired, together and with others, to possess and to distribute unlawful drugs. A jury convicted all four. But the trial judge then decided that the jury instructions had been erroneous in respect to Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza. The judge noted that theNinth Circuit, in Cruz, had held that the Government could not prosecute drug conspiracy defendants unless they had joined the conspiracy before the Government seized the drugs. See Cruz, supra, at 795-796. That holding, as applied here, meant that the jury could not convict Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza unless the jury believed they had joined the conspiracy before the Nevada police stopped the truck and seized the drugs. The judge ordered a new trial where the jury would be instructed to that effect. The new jury convicted the two men once again.

Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza appealed. They pointed out that, given Cruz, the jury had to find that they  had joined the conspiracy before the Nevada stop, and they claimed that the evidence was insufficient at both trials to warrant any such jury finding. The Ninth Circuit panel, by a vote of 2 to 1, agreed. All three panel members accepted Cruz as binding law. Two members concluded that the evidence presented at the second trial was not sufficient to show that the defendants had joined the conspiracy before the Nevada drug seizure. One of the two wrote that the evidence at the first trial was not sufficient either, a circumstance she believed independently warranted reversal. The third member, dissenting, believed that the evidence at both trials adequately demonstrated preseizure membership. He added that he, like the other panel members, was bound by Cruz, but he wrote that in his view Cruzwas "totally inconsistent with long established and appropriate principles of the law of conspiracy," and he urged the Circuit to overrule it en  banc "at the earliest opportunity." 258 F.3d 1069, 1079, n. 2 (opinion of Gould, J.).

The Government sought certiorari. It noted that the Ninth Circuit's holding in this case was premised upon the legal rule enunciated in Cruz. And it asked us to decide the rule's validity, i.e., to decide whether "a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the government frustrates its objective." Pet. for Cert. I. We agreed to consider that question.

IIIn Cruz, the Ninth Circuit held that a conspiracy continues "'until there is affirmative evidence of abandonment, withdrawal, disavowal or defeat of the object of the conspiracy.'" 127 F.3d at 795 (quoting Castro, supra, at 1112). The critical portion of this statement is the last segment, that a conspiracy ends once there has been "defeat of [its] object." The Circuit's holdings make clear that the phrase means that the conspiracy ends through "defeat" when the Government intervenes, making the conspiracy's goals impossible to achieve, even if the conspirators do not know that the Government has intervened and are totally unaware that the conspiracy is bound to fail. In our view, this statement of the law is incorrect. A conspiracy does not automatically terminate simply because the Government, unbeknownst to some of the conspirators, has "defeated" the conspiracy's "object."Two basic considerations convince us that this is the proper view of the law. First, the Ninth Circuit's rule is inconsistent with our own understanding of basic conspiracy law. The Court has repeatedly said that the essence of a conspiracy is "an agreement to commit an unlawful act." Iannelli v. United States,420 U.S. 770, 777, 43 L. Ed. 2d 616, 95 S. Ct. 1284 (1975); see United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 16, 130 L. Ed. 2d 225, 115 S. Ct. 382 (1994);Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 53, 87 L. Ed. 23, 63 S. Ct. 99 (1942).That agreement is "a distinct evil," which "may exist and be punished whether or not the substantive crime ensues." Salinas v. United  States, 522 U.S. 52, 65, 139 L. Ed. 2d 352, 118 S. Ct. 469 (1997). The conspiracy poses a "threat to the public" over and above the threat of the commission of the relevant substantive crime -- both because the "combination in crime makes more likely the commission of [other] crimes" and because it "decreases the probability that the individuals involved will depart from  their path of criminality." Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593-594, 5 L. Ed. 2d 312, 81 S. Ct. 321 (1961); see also United States v. Rabinowich, 238 U.S. 78, 88, 59 L. Ed. 1211, 35 S. Ct. 682 (1915) (conspiracy "sometimes quite outweighs, in injury to the public, the mere commission of the contemplated crime"). Where police have frustrated a conspiracy's specific objective but conspirators (unaware of that fact) have neither abandoned the conspiracy nor withdrawn, these special conspiracy-related dangers remain. Cf. 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 6.5, p. 85 (1986) ("impossibility" does not terminate conspiracy because "criminal combinations are dangerous apart from the danger of attaining the particular objective"). So too remains the essence of the conspiracy -- the agreement to commit the crime. That being so, the Government's defeat of the conspiracy's objective will not necessarily and automatically terminate the conspiracy.

Second, the view we endorse today is the view of almost all courts and commentators but for the Ninth Circuit. No other Federal Court of Appeals has adopted the Ninth Circuit's rule. Three have explicitly rejected it. In United States v. Wallace, 85 F.3d 1063, 1068 (CA2 1996), for example, the court said that the fact that a "conspiracy cannot actually be realized because of facts unknown to the conspirators is irrelevant." See also United States v. Belardo-Quinones, 71 F.3d 941, 944 (CA1 1995) (conspiracy exists even if, unbeknownst to conspirators, crime is impossible to commit); United States v. LaBudda, 882 F.2d 244, 248 (CA7 1989) (defendants can be found guilty of conspiracy even if conspiracy's object "is unattainable from the very beginning"). One treatise, after surveying lower court conspiracy  decisions, has concluded that "impossibility of success is not a defense." 2 LaFave & Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 6.5, at 85; see also id., § 6.5(b), at 90-93. And the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code § 5.03, p. 384 (1985), would find that a conspiracy "terminates when the crime or crimes that are its object are committed" or when the relevant "agreement . . . is abandoned." It would not find "impossibility" a basis for termination.The Cruzmajority argued that the more traditional termination rule threatened "endless" potential liability. To illustrate the point, the majority posited a sting in which police instructed an arrested conspirator to go through the "telephone directory . . . [and] call all of his acquaintances" to come and help him, with the Government obtaining convictions of those who did so.  127 F.3d at 795, n. 3.The problem with this example, however, is that, even though it is not necessarily an example of entrapment itself, it draws its persuasive force from the fact that it bears certain resemblances to entrapment. The law independently forbids convictions that rest upon entrapment. See Jacobson v. United States, 503 U.S. 540, 548-549, 118 L. Ed. 2d 174, 112 S. Ct. 1535 (1992); Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 442-445, 77 L. Ed. 413, 53 S. Ct. 210, 38 Ohio L. Rep. 326 (1932). And the example fails to explain why a different branch of the law, conspiracy law, should be modified to forbid entrapment-like behavior that falls outside the bounds of current entrapment law. Cf.  United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 435, 36 L. Ed. 2d 366, 93 S. Ct. 1637 (1973) ("defense of entrapment . . . not intended to give the federal judiciary . . . veto" over disapproved "law enforcement practices"). At the same time, the Cruzrule would reach well beyond arguable police misbehavior, potentially threatening the use of properly run law enforcement sting operations. See Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 208-209, 17 L. Ed. 2d 312, 87 S. Ct. 424 (1966) (Government may "use decoys" and conceal agents' identity); see also M. Lyman, Criminal Investigation 484-485 (2d ed. 1999) (explaining the importance of undercover operations in enforcing drug laws).

In tracing the origins of the statement of conspiracy law upon which the Cruzpanel relied, we have found a 1982 Ninth Circuit case, United States v. Bloch, 696 F.2d 1213, in which the court, referring to an earlier case, United States v. Krasn, 614 F.2d 1229 (CA9 1980), changed the language of the traditional conspiracy termination rule. Krasn said that a conspiracy is "'presumed to continue unless there is affirmative evidence that the defendant abandoned, withdrew from, or disavowed the conspiracy or defeated its purpose.'" Id., at 1236 (emphasis added). The Bloch panel changed the grammatical structure. It said that "a conspiracy is presumed to continue until there is . . . defeat of the purposes of the conspiracy." 696 F.2d at 1215 (emphasis added). Later Ninth Circuit cases apparently read the change to mean that a conspiracy terminates, not only when the defendant defeats its objective, but also when someone else defeats that objective, perhaps the police. In Castro, the panel followed Bloch. 972 F.2d at 1112. In Cruz, the panel quoted Castro. This history may help to explain the origin of the Cruzrule. But, since the Circuit's earlier cases nowhere give any reason for the critical change of language, they cannot help to justify it.

III

We conclude that the Ninth Circuit's conspiracy-termination law holding set forth in Cruz is erroneous in the manner discussed. We reverse the present judgment insofar as it relies upon that holding. Because Jimenez Recio and Lopez-Meza have raised other arguments not here considered, we remand the case, specifying that the Court of Appeals may consider  those arguments, if they were properly raised.

The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari in these cases to answer two questions. First, whether petitioners committed extortion within the meaning of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951. Second, whether respondents, as private litigants, may obtain injunctive relief in a civil action pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964 of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). We hold that petitioners did not commit extortion because they did not "obtain" property from respondents as required by the Hobbs Act. We further hold that our determination with respect to extortion under the Hobbs Act renders insufficient the other bases or predicate acts of racketeering supporting the jury's conclusion that petitioners violated RICO. Therefore, we reverse without reaching the question of the availability of private injunctive relief under § 1964(c) of RICO.

We once again address questions arising from litigation between petitioners, a coalition of antiabortion groups called the Pro-Life Action Network (PLAN), Joseph Scheidler and other individuals and organizations that oppose legal abortion, 1The other petitioners include Andrew Scholberg, Timothy Murphy, and Operation Rescue. and respondents, the National Organization for Women, Inc. (NOW), a national nonprofit organization that supports the legal availability of abortion, and two health  care centers that perform abortions. 2NOW represents a certified class of all NOW members and non-members who have used or would use the services of an abortion clinic in the United States. The two clinics, the National Women's Health Organization of Summit, Inc., and the National Women's Health Organization of Delaware, Inc., represent a class of all clinics in the United States at which abortions are provided. Our earlier decision provides a substantial description of the factual and procedural history of this litigation, see National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler,510 U.S. 249, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99, 114 S. Ct. 798 (1994), and so we recount only those details necessary to address the questions here presented.

 In 1986, respondents sued in the United States District Court for the  Northern District of Illinois alleging, inter alia, that petitioners violated RICO's §§ 1962(a), (c), and (d). They claimed that petitioners, all of whom were associated with PLAN, the alleged racketeering enterprise, were members of a nationwide conspiracy to "shut down" abortion clinics through a pattern of racketeering activity that included acts of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. 3The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), provides that "whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both."

The District Court dismissed respondents' RICO claims for failure to allege that the predicate acts of racketeering or the racketeering enterprise were economically motivated. See National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 765 F. Supp. 937 (ND Ill. 1991). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed that dismissal. See National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 968 F.2d 612 (1992). We granted certiorari and reversed, concluding that RICO does not require proof that either the racketeering enterprise or the predicate acts of racketeering were motivated  by an economic purpose. See Scheidler,510 U.S., at 256-262. The case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.

After a 7-week trial, a six-member jury concluded that petitioners violated the civil provisions of RICO. By answering a series of special interrogatory questions, the jury found, inter alia, that petitioners' alleged "pattern of racketeering activity" included 21 violations of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951; 25 violations of state extortion law; 25 instances of attempting or conspiring to commit either federal or state extortion; 23 violations of the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952; and 23 instances of attempting to violate the Travel Act. The jury awarded $ 31,455.64 to respondent, the National Women's Health Organization of Delaware, Inc., and $ 54,471.28 to the National Women's Health Organization of Summit, Inc. These damages were trebled pursuant to § 1964(c). Additionally, the  District Court entered a permanent nationwide injunction prohibiting petitioners from obstructing access to the clinics, trespassing on clinic property, damaging clinic property, or using violence or threats of violence against the clinics, their employees, or their patients.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed in relevant part. The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' contention that the things respondents claimed were "obtained" -- the class women's right to seek medical services from the clinics, the clinic doctors' rights to perform their jobs, and the clinics' rights to provide medical services and otherwise conduct their business -- were not "property" for purposes of the Hobbs Act. The court explained that it had "repeatedly held that intangible property such as the right to conduct a business can be considered 'property' under the Hobbs Act." NOW, Inc. v. Scheidler 267 F.3d 687, 709 (2001). Likewise, the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioners' claim that even if  "property" was involved, petitioners did not "obtain" that property; they merely forced respondents to part with it. Again relying on Circuit precedent, the court held that "'as a legal  matter, an extortionist can violate the Hobbs Act without either seeking or receiving money or anything else. A loss to, or interference with the rights of, the victim is all that is required.'" Ibid. (quoting United States v. Stillo, 57 F.3d 553, 559 (CA7 1995)). Finally, the Court of Appeals upheld the issuance of the nationwide injunction, finding that private plaintiffs are entitled to obtain injunctive relief under § 1964(c) of RICO.  We granted certiorari, 535 U.S. 1016 (2002), and now reverse.We first address the question whether petitioners' actions constituted extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act. That Act defines extortion as "the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right." 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). Petitioners allege that the jury's verdict and the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the verdict represent a vast and unwarranted expansion of extortion under the Hobbs Act. They say that the decisions below "read the requirement of 'obtaining' completely out of the statute" and conflict with the proper understanding of property for purposes of the Hobbs Act. Brief for Petitioners Joseph Scheidler et al. in No. 01-1118, pp. 11-13.

Respondents, throughout the course of this litigation, have asserted, as the jury instructions at the trial reflected, 4The instruction given to the jury regarding extortion under the Hobbs Act provided that "plaintiffs have alleged that the defendant and others associated with PLAN committed acts that violate federal law prohibiting extortion. In order to show that extortion has been committed in violation of federal law, the plaintiffs must show that the defendant or someone else associated with PLAN knowingly, willfully, and wrongfully used actual or threatened force, violence or fear to cause women, clinic doctors, nurses or other staff, or the clinics themselves to give up a 'property right.'" Jury Instruction No. 24, App. 136. that petitioners committed extortion under the Hobbs Act by using or threatening to use force, violence, or fear to cause respondents "to give up" property rights, namely, "a woman's right to seek medical services from a clinic, the right of  the doctors, nurses or other clinic staff to perform their jobs, and the right of the clinics to provide medical services free from wrongful threats, violence, coercion and fear." Jury Instruction No. 24, App. 136. Perhaps recognizing the apparent difficulty in reconciling either its position that "giving up" these alleged property rights or the Court of Appeals' holding that "interfering with such rights" with the requirement that petitioners "obtained . . . property from" them, respondents have shifted the thrust of their theory.  267 F.3d at 687. Respondents now assert that petitioners violated the Hobbs Act by "seeking to get control of the use and disposition of respondents'  property." Brief for Respondents 24. They argue that because the right to control the use and disposition of an asset is property, petitioners, who interfered with, and in some instances completely disrupted, the ability of the clinics to function, obtained or attempted to obtain respondents' property.

 The United States offers a view similar to that of respondents, asserting that "where the property at issue is a business's intangible right to exercise exclusive control over the use of its assets, [a] defendant obtains that property by obtaining control over the use of those assets." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22. Although the Government acknowledges that the jury's finding of extortion may have been improperly based on the conclusion that petitioners deprived respondents of a liberty interest, 5The Solicitor General agreed at oral argument that even if we accept the Government's view as to extortion under the Hobbs Act, the case must be remanded because the generalized jury instruction regarding federal extortion included a woman's right to seek medical services as a property right petitioners' could extort from respondents; a right he acknowledged is more accurately characterized as an individual liberty interest. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-31. it maintains that under its theory of liability, petitioners committed extortion.

 We need not now trace what are the outer boundaries of extortion liability under the Hobbs Act, so that liability might be based on obtaining something as intangible as another's right to exercise exclusive control over the use of a party's business assets. 6Accordingly, the dissent is mistaken to suggest that our decision reaches, much less rejects, lower court decisions such as United States v. Tropiano, 418 F.2d 1069, 1076 (1969), in which the Second Circuit concluded that the intangible right to solicit refuse collection accounts "constituted property within the Hobbs Act definition." Our decisions in United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 415, 420, 100 L. Ed. 494, 76 S. Ct. 522 (1956) (explaining that "extortion . . . in no way depends upon having a direct benefit conferred on the person who obtains the property"), and Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 27, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275, 108 S. Ct. 316 (1987) (finding that confidential business information constitutes "property" for purposes of the federal mail fraud statute), do not require such a result. Whatever the outer boundaries may be, the effort to characterize petitioners' actions here as an "obtaining of property from" respondents is well beyond them. Such a result would be an unwarranted expansion of the meaning of that phrase.

Absent contrary direction from Congress, we begin our interpretation of statutory language with the general presumption that a statutory term has its common-law meaning. See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 592, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143 (1990); Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 263, 96 L. Ed. 288, 72 S. Ct. 240 (1952). At common law, extortion was a property offense committed by a public official who took "any money or thing of value" that was not due to him under the pretense that he was entitled to such property by virtue of his office. 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 141 (1765); 3 R. Anderson, Wharton's Criminal Law and Procedure § 1393, pp. 790-791 (1957). In 1946, Congress enacted the Hobbs Act, which explicitly "expanded the common-law definition of extortion to include acts by private individuals." Evans v. United States,504 U.S. 255, 261, 119 L. Ed. 2d 57, 112 S. Ct. 1881 (1992). While  the Hobbs Act expanded the scope of common-law extortion to include private individuals, the statutory language retained the requirement that property must be "obtained." See 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2).Congress used two sources  of law as models in formulating the Hobbs Act: the Penal Code of New York and the Field Code, a 19th-century model penal code.  See Evans, supra, at 262.7Representative Hobbs explicitly stated that the term extortion was "based on the New York law." 89 Cong. Rec. 3227 (1943). Both the New York statute and the Field Code defined extortion as "the obtaining of property from another with his consent, induced by a wrongful use of force or fear or under color of official right." 4 Report of the Commissioners of the Code, Proposed Penal Code of the State of New York § 613 (1865) (reprint 1998) (Field Code); N. Y. Penal Law § 850 (1909). The Field Code explained that extortion was one of four property crimes, along with robbery, larceny, and embezzlement that included "the criminal acquisition of . . . property." § 584 note, p. 210. New York case law before the enactment of the Hobbs Act demonstrates that this "obtaining of property" requirement included both a deprivation and acquisition of property. See, e.g., People v. Ryan, 232 N. Y. 234, 236, 133 N. E. 572, 573 (1921) (explaining that an intent "to extort" requires an accompanying intent to "gain money or property"); People v. Weinseimer, 117 App. Div. 603, 616, 102 N. Y. S. 579, 588, 20 N.Y. Cr. 537 (1907) (noting that in an extortion prosecution, the issue that must be decided is whether the accused "received [money] from the complainant"). 8The dissent endorses the opinion of the Court of Appeals in United States v. Arena, 180 F.3d 380 (CA2 1999), to reach a more expansive definition of "obtain" than is found in the cases just cited. The Court of Appeals quoted part of a dictionary definition of the word "obtain" in Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 180 F.3d at 394. The full text of the definition reads "to gain or attain possession or disposal of." That court then resorted to the dictionary definition of "disposal," which includes "the regulation of the fate . . . of something." Surely if the rule of lenity, which we have held applicable to the Hobbs Act, see infra, at 13-14, means anything, it means that the familiar meaning of the word "obtain" -- to gain possession of -- should be preferred to the vague and obscure "to attain regulation of the fate of."



We too have recognized that the "obtaining" requirement of extortion under New York law entailed both a deprivation and acquisition of property. See United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 406, n. 16, 35 L. Ed. 2d 379, 93 S. Ct. 1007, (1973) (noting that "judicial construction of the New York statute" demonstrated that "extortion requires an intent 'to obtain that which in justice and equity the party is not entitled to receive'") (quoting People v. Cuddihy, 151 Misc. 318, 324, 271 N. Y. S. 450, 456 (1934)). Most importantly, we have construed the extortion provision of the Hobbs Act at issue in this case to require not only the deprivation but also the acquisition of property. See, e.g., Enmons, supra, at 400. (Extortion under the Hobbs Act requires a "'wrongful' taking of . . . property" (emphasis added)). With this understanding of the Hobbs Act's requirement that a person must "obtain" property from another party to commit extortion, we turn to the facts of these cases.

There is no dispute in these cases that petitioners interfered with, disrupted, and in some instances completely deprived respondents of their ability to exercise their property rights. Likewise, petitioners' counsel readily acknowledged at oral argument that aspects of his clients' conduct  were criminal. 9"QUESTION: But are we talking about actions that constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense in the process?. . . . ."MR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes. Trespass."QUESTION: Yes, and other things, destruction of property and so forth, I suppose."MR. ENGLERT: Oh, yes . . . .. . . . ."QUESTION: I mean, we're not talking about conduct that is lawful here."MR. ENGLERT: We are not talking about extortion, but we are talking about some things that could be punished much less severely. It has never been disputed in this case . . . that there were trespasses." Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. But even when their acts of interference and disruption  achieved their ultimate goal of "shutting down" a clinic that performed abortions, such acts did not constitute extortion because petitioners did not "obtain" respondents' property. Petitioners may have deprived or sought to deprive respondents of their alleged property right of exclusive control of their business assets, but they did not acquire any such property. Petitioners neither pursued nor received "something of value from" respondents that they could exercise, transfer, or sell.  United States v. Nardello, 393 U.S. 286, 290, 21 L. Ed. 2d 487, 89 S. Ct. 534 (1969). To conclude that such actions constituted extortion would effectively discard the statutory requirement that property must be obtained from another, replacing it instead with the notion that merely interfering with or depriving someone of property is sufficient to constitute extortion.

Eliminating the requirement that property must be obtained to constitute extortion would not only conflict with the express requirement of the Hobbs Act, it would also eliminate the recognized distinction between extortion and the separate crime of coercion -- a distinction that is implicated in these cases. The crime of coercion, which more accurately describes the nature of petitioners' actions, involves the use of force or threat of force to restrict another's freedom of action. Coercion's origin is statutory, and it was clearly defined in the New York Penal Code as a separate, and lesser offense than extortion when Congress turned to New York law in drafting the Hobbs Act. 10New York Penal Law § 530 (1909), Coercing another person a misdemeanor, provided: "A person who with a view to compel another person to do or to abstain from doing an act which such other person has a legal right to do or to abstain from doing, wrongfully and unlawfully,"1. Uses violence or inflicts injury upon such other person or his family, or a member thereof, or upon his property or threatens such violence or injury; or,"2. Deprives any such person of any tool, implement or clothing or hinders him in the use thereof; or,"3. Uses or attempts the intimidation of such person by threats or force,"Is guilty of a misdemeanor." New York case  law applying the coercion statute before the passage of the Hobbs Act involved the prosecution of individuals who, like petitioners, employed threats and acts of force and violence to dictate and restrict the actions and decisions of businesses. See, e.g., People v. Ginsberg, 262 N. Y. 556, 188 N. E. 62 (1933) (affirming convictions for coercion where defendant used threatened and actual property damage to compel the owner of a drug store to become a member of a local trade association and to remove price advertisements for specific merchandise from his store's windows); People v. Scotti, 266 N. Y. 480, 195 N. E. 162 (1934) (affirming conviction for coercion where defendants used threatened and actual force to compel a manufacturer to enter into an agreement with a labor union of which the defendants were members); People v. Kaplan, 240 App. Div. 72, 269 N. Y. S. 161 (1934) (affirming convictions for coercion where defendants, members of a labor union, used threatened and actual physical violence to compel other members of the union to drop lawsuits challenging the manner in which defendants were handling the union's finances).

With this distinction between extortion and coercion clearly drawn in New York law prior to 1946, Congress' decision to include extortion as a violation of the Hobbs Act and omit coercion is significant assistance to our interpretation of the breadth of the extortion provision. This assistance is amplified by other evidence of Congress' awareness of the difference between these two distinct crimes. In 1934, Congress formulated the Anti-Racketeering Act, ch. 569, 48 Stat. 979. This Act, which was the predecessor to the Hobbs Act, targeted, as its name suggests, racketeering activities that affected interstate commerce, including both extortion and coercion as defined under New York law. 11A subcommittee of the Commerce Committee, known as the Copeland Subcommittee, employed a working definition of "racketeering," which included organized conspiracies to "commit the crimes of extortion or coercion, or attempts to commit extortion or coercion, within the definition of these crimes found in the penal law of the State of New York and other jurisdictions." S. Rep. No. 1189, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1937); United States v. Culbert, 435 U.S. 371, 375-376, 55 L. Ed. 2d 349, 98 S. Ct. 1112 (1978). Accordingly, the  Act contained both a section explicitly prohibiting coercion and a section prohibiting the offense of extortion as defined by the Field Code and New York Penal Code. See ch. 569, §§ 2(a) and 2(b).

Several years after the enactment of the Anti-Racketeering Act, this Court decided United States v. Teamsters, 315 U.S. 521, 86 L. Ed. 1004, 62 S. Ct. 642 (1942). In Teamsters, this Court construed an exception provided in the Anti-Racketeering Act for the payment of wages by a bona fide employer to a bona fide employee to find that the Act "did not cover the actions of union truckdrivers who exacted money by threats or violence from out-of-town drivers in return for undesired and often unutilized services." United States v. Culbert, 435 U.S. 371, 377, 55 L. Ed. 2d 349, 98 S. Ct. 1112 (1978) (citing Teamsters, supra). "Congressional disapproval of this decision was swift," and the Hobbs Act was subsequently enacted to supersede the Anti-Racketeering Act and reverse the result in Teamsters. Enmons, 410 U.S., at 402, and n. 8. The Act prohibited interference with commerce, by "robbery or extortion" but, as explained above, did not mention coercion.

This omission of coercion is particularly significant in light of the fact that after Teamsters, a "paramount congressional concern" in drafting the Hobbs Act, "was to be clear about what conduct was prohibited." Culbert, supra, at 378.12As we reported in Culbert, supra, at 378: "Indeed, many Congressmen praised the [Hobbs Act] because it set out with more precision the conduct that was being made criminal. As Representative Hobbs noted, the words robbery and extortion 'have been construed a thousand times by the courts. Everybody knows what they mean'" (quoting 91 Cong. Rec. 11912 (1945)). Accordingly, the Act "carefully defines its key  terms, such as 'robbery,' 'extortion,' and 'commerce.'" Id., at 373. Thus, while coercion and extortion certainly overlap to the extent that extortion necessarily involves the use of coercive  conduct to obtain property, there has been and continues to be a recognized difference between these two crimes, see, e.g., ALI, Model Penal Code and Commentaries §§ 212.5, 223.4 (1980) (hereinafter Model Penal Code), 13Under the Model Penal Code § 223.4, Comment 1, pp. 201-202, extortion requires that one "obtains [the] property of another" using threat as "the method employed to deprive the victim of his property." This "obtaining" is further explained as "' bringing about a transfer or purported transfer of a legal interest in the property, whether to the obtainer or another.'" Id., § 223.3, Comment 2, at 182, Coercion, on the other hand, is defined as making "specified categories of threats . . . with the purpose of unlawfully restricting another's freedom of action to his detriment." Id., § 212.5, Comment 2, at 264. and we find it evident that this distinction was not lost on Congress in formulating the Hobbs Act.

We have said that the words of the Hobbs Act "do not lend themselves to restrictive interpretation" because they "'manifest . . . a purpose to use all the constitutional power Congress has to punish interference with interstate commerce by extortion, robbery or physical violence.'" Culbert, supra, at 373 (quoting Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 215, 4 L. Ed. 2d 252, 80 S. Ct. 270 (1960)). We have also said, construing the Hobbs Act in Enmons, supra, at 411:

"Even if the language and history of the Act were less clear than we have found them to be, the Act could not properly be expanded as the Government suggests -- for two related reasons. First,  this being a criminal statute, it must be strictly construed, and any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of lenity (citations omitted)."

We think that these two seemingly antithetical statements can be reconciled. Culbert refused to adopt the view that Congress had not exercised the full extent of its commerce power in prohibiting extortion which "affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce." But there is no contention by petitioners here that their acts did not affect interstate commerce. Their argument is that  their acts did not amount to the crime of extortion as set forth in the Act, so the rule of lenity referred to in Enmons may apply to their case quite consistently with the statement in Culbert. "When there are two rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other, we are to choose the harsher only when Congress has spoken in clear and definite language." McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 359-360, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, 107 S. Ct. 2875 (1987). If the distinction between extortion and coercion, which we find controls these cases, is to be abandoned, such a significant expansion of the law's coverage must come from Congress, and not from the courts.

Because we find that petitioners did not obtain or attempt to obtain property from respondents, we conclude that there was no basis upon which to find that they committed extortion under the Hobbs Act.

The jury also found that petitioners had committed extortion under various state-law extortion statutes, a separate RICO predicate offense. Petitioners challenged the jury instructions as to these on appeal, but the Court of Appeals held that any error was harmless, because the Hobbs Act verdicts were sufficient to support the relief awarded. Respondents argue in this Court that state extortion offenses do not have to be identical to Hobbs Act extortion to be predicate offenses supporting a RICO violation. They concede, however, that for a state offense to be an "act or threat involving . . . extortion, . . . which is chargeable under State law," as RICO requires, see 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1), the conduct must be capable of being generically classified as extortionate. Brief for Respondents 33-34. They further agree that such "generic" extortion is defined as "'obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats.'" ID., at 34 (quoting Nardello, 393 U.S., at 290).

This concession is in accord with our decisions in Nardello and Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 109 L. Ed. 2d 607, 110 S. Ct. 2143 (1990). In Nardello, we held that the Travel Act's prohibition, 18 U.S.C. § 1952(b)(2),  against "extortion . . . in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United States" applies to extortionate conduct classified by a state penal code as blackmail rather than extortion. We determined that if an act prohibited under state law fell within a generic definition of extortion, for which we relied on the Model Penal Code's definition of "obtaining something of value from another with his consent induced by the wrongful use of force, fear, or threats," it would constitute a violation of the Travel Act's prohibition regardless of the State's label for that unlawful act. See Nardello, supra, at 296 (explaining that regardless of Pennsylvania's labeling defendants' acts as blackmail and not extortion, defendants violated the Travel Act because "the indictment encompasses a type of activity generally known as extortionate since money was to be obtained from the victim by virtue of fear and threats of exposure"). In Taylor, relying in part on Nardello, we concluded that in including "burglary" as a violent crime in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)'s sentencing enhancement provision for felons' possessing firearms, Congress meant "burglary" in "the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States." 495 U.S., at 598. Accordingly, where as here the Model Penal Code and a majority of States recognize the crime of extortion as requiring a party to obtain or to seek to obtain property, as the Hobbs Act requires, the state extortion offense for purposes of RICO must have a similar requirement.

Because petitioners did not obtain or attempt to obtain respondents' property, both the state extortion claims and the claim of attempting or conspiring to commit state extortion were fatally flawed. The 23 violations of the Travel Act and 23 acts of attempting to violate the Travel Act also fail. These acts were committed in furtherance of allegedly extortionate conduct. But we have already determined that petitioners  did not commit or attempt to commit extortion.

Because all of the predicate acts supporting the jury's finding of a RICO violation must be reversed, the judgment that petitioners violated RICO must also be reversed. Without an underlying RICO violation, the injunction issued by the District Court must necessarily be vacated. We therefore need not address the second question presented -- whether a private plaintiff in a civil RICO action is entitled to injunctive relief under 18 U.S.C. § 1964.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly

Reversed.  


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.

We granted certiorari to determine whether the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit properly enjoined the public disclosure of Connecticut's sex offender  registry. The Court of Appeals concluded that such disclosure both deprived registered sex offenders of a "liberty interest," and violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to be "currently dangerous." Doe v. Department of Public Safety ex rel. Lee, 271 F.3d 38, 44, 46 (2001). Connecticut, however, has decided that the registry requirement shall be based on the fact of previous conviction, not the fact of current dangerousness. Indeed, the public registry explicitly states that officials have not determined that any registrant is currently dangerous. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals because due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State's statutory scheme.

"Sex offenders are a serious threat in this Nation." McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 32, 153 L. Ed. 2d 47, 122 S. Ct. 2017 (2002) (plurality opinion). "The victims of sex assault are most often juveniles," and "when convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be re-arrested for a new rape or sex assault." Id., at 32-33. Connecticut, like every other State, has responded to these facts by enacting a statute designed to protect its communities from sex offenders and to help apprehend repeat sex offenders. Connecticut's "Megan's Law" applies to all persons convicted of criminal offenses against a minor, violent and nonviolent sexual offenses, and felonies committed for a sexual purpose. Covered offenders must register with the Connecticut Department of Public Safety (DPS) upon their release into the community. Each must provide personal information (including his name, address, photograph, and DNA sample); notify DPS of any change in residence; and periodically submit an updated photograph. The registration requirement runs for 10 years in most cases; those convicted  of sexually violent offenses must register for life. Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 54-251, 54-252, 54-254 (2001).

The statute requires DPS to compile the information gathered from registrants and publicize it. In particular, the law requires DPS to post a sex offender registry on an Internet Website and to make the registry available to the public in certain state offices. §§ 54-257, 54-258. Whether made available in an office or via the Internet, the registry must be accompanied by the following warning: "'Any person who uses information in this registry to injure, harass or commit a criminal act against any person included in the registry or any other person is subject to criminal prosecution.'" § 54-258a.

Before the District Court enjoined its operation, the State's Website enabled citizens to obtain the name, address, photograph, and description of any registered sex offender by entering a zip code or town name. The following disclaimer appeared on the first page of the Website:

"'The registry is based on the legislature's decision to facilitate access to publicly-available information about persons convicted of sexual offenses. [DPS] has not considered or assessed the specific risk of reoffense with regard to any individual prior to his or her inclusion within this registry, and has  made no determination that any individual included in the registry is currently dangerous. Individuals included within the registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and state law. The main purpose of providing this data on the Internet is to make the information more easily available and accessible, not to warn about any specific individual.'" 271 F.3d at 44.

Petitioners include the state agencies and officials charged with compiling the sex offender registry and posting it on the Internet. Respondent Doe is a convicted sex offender who is subject to Connecticut's Megan's  Law. He filed this action pursuant to Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, on behalf of himself and similarly situated sex offenders, claiming that the law violates, inter alia, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Specifically, respondent alleged that he is not a "'dangerous sexual offender,'" and that the Connecticut law "deprives him of a liberty interest -- his reputation combined with the alteration of his status under state law -- without notice or a meaningful opportunity to be heard." 271 F.3d at 45-46. The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent on his due process claim.  132 F. Supp. 2d 57 (Conn. 2001). The court then certified a class of individuals subject to the Connecticut law, and permanently enjoined the law's public disclosure provisions.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, 271 F.3d 38 (CA2 2001), holding that the Due Process Clause entitles class members to a hearing "to determine whether or not they are particularly likely to be currently dangerous before being labeled as such by their inclusion in a publicly disseminated registry." Id., at 62. Because Connecticut had not provided such a hearing, the Court of Appeals enjoined petitioners from "'disclosing or disseminating to the public, either in printed or electronic form (a) the Registry or (b) Registry information concerning [class members]'" and from "'identifying [them] as being included in the Registry.'" Ibid. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the Connecticut law implicated a "liberty interest" because of: (1) the law's stigmatization of respondent by "implying" that he is "currently dangerous,"  and (2) its imposition of "extensive and onerous" registration obligations on respondent. Id., at 57. From this liberty interest arose an obligation, in the Court of Appeals' view, to give respondent an opportunity to demonstrate that he was not "likely to be currently dangerous." Id., at 62. We granted certiorari, 535 U.S. 1077, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1020, 122 S. Ct. 1959, (2002).

In Paul v. Davis,424 U.S. 693, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405, 96 S. Ct. 1155 (1976), we held that mere injury to reputation, even if defamatory, does not constitute  the deprivation of a liberty interest. Petitioners urge us to reverse the Court of Appeals on the ground that, under Paul v. Davis, respondent has failed to establish that petitioners have deprived him of a liberty interest. We find it unnecessary to reach this question, however, because even assuming, arguendo, that respondent has been deprived of a liberty interest, due process does not entitle him to a hearing to establish a fact that is not material under the Connecticut statute.

In cases such as Wisconsin v. Constantineau,400 U.S. 433, 27 L. Ed. 2d 515, 91 S. Ct. 507 (1971), and Goss v. Lopez,419 U.S. 565, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725, 95 S. Ct. 729 (1975), we held that due process required the government to accord the plaintiff a hearing to prove or disprove a particular fact or set of facts. But in each of these cases, the fact in question was concededly relevant to the inquiry at hand. Here, however, the fact that respondent seeks to prove -- that he is not currently dangerous -- is of no consequence under Connecticut's Megan's Law. As the DPS Website explains, the law's requirements turn on an offender's conviction alone -- a fact that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest. 271 F.3d at 44 ("'Individuals included within the registry are included solely by virtue of their conviction record and state law'" (emphasis added)). No other fact is relevant to the disclosure of registrants' information. Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 54-257, 54-258 (2001). Indeed, the disclaimer on the Website explicitly states that respondent's alleged nondangerousness simply does not matter.  271 F.3d at 44 ("'[DPS] has made no determination that any individual included in the registry is currently dangerous'").In short, even if respondent could prove that he is not likely to be currently dangerous, Connecticut has decided that the registry information of all sex offenders -- currently dangerous or not -- must be publicly disclosed. Unless respondent can show that that substantive rule of law is defective (by conflicting with a provision of the Constitution), any  hearing on current dangerousness is a bootless exercise. It may be that respondent's claim is actually a substantive challenge to Connecticut's statute "recast in 'procedural due process'  terms." Reno v. Flores,507 U.S. 292, 308, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1, 113 S. Ct. 1439 (1993). Nonetheless, respondent expressly disavows any reliance on the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment's protections, Brief for Respondent 44-45, and maintains, as he did below, that his challenge is strictly a procedural one. But States are not barred by principles of "procedural due process" from drawing such classifications.  Michael H. v. Gerald D.,491 U.S. 110, 120, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91, 109 S. Ct. 2333 (1989) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in original). See also id., at 132 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment). Such claims "must ultimately be analyzed" in terms of substantive, not procedural, due process. Id., at 121. Because the question is not properly before us, we express no opinion as to whether Connecticut's Megan's Law violates principles of substantive due process.

Plaintiffs who assert a right to a hearing under the Due Process Clause must show that the facts they seek to establish in that hearing are relevant under the statutory scheme. Respondent cannot make that showing here. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore Reversed.  


JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court. *JUSTICE SCALIA joins all but Part III of this opinion.

 In 1995 Congress amended § 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, to provide a remedy for the "dilution of famous marks." 109 Stat. 985-986. That amendment, known as the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA), describes the factors that determine whether a mark is "distinctive  and famous," and defines the term "dilution" as "the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services." 1The FTDA provides: "SEC. 3. REMEDIES FOR DILUTION OF FAMOUS MARKS."(a) REMEDIES. -- Section 43 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1125) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:"'(c)(1) The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark, and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection. In determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous, a court may consider factors such as, but not limited to --"'(A) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark;"'(B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used;"'(C) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark;"'(D) the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used;"'(E) the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used;"'(F) the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the marks' owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought;"'(G) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties; and"'(H) whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register."'(2) In an action brought under this subsection, the owner of the famous mark shall be entitled only to injunctive relief unless the person against whom the injunction is sought willfully intended to trade on the owner's reputation or to cause dilution of the famous mark. If such willful intent is proven, the owner of the famous mark shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in sections 35(a) and 36, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity."'(3) The ownership by a person of a valid registration under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register shall be a complete bar to an action against that person, with respect to that mark, that is brought by another person under the common law or a statute of a State and that seeks to prevent dilution of the distinctiveness of a mark, label, or form of advertisement."'(4) The following shall not be actionable under this section:"'(A) Fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark."'(B) Noncommercial use of a mark."'(C) All forms of news reporting and news commentary.'"(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT. -- The heading for title VIII of the Trademark Act of 1946 is amended by striking 'AND FALSE DESCRIPTIONS' and inserting ', FALSE DESCRIPTIONS, AND DILUTION.'"SEC. 4. DEFINITION."Section 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1127) is amended by inserting after the paragraph defining when a mark shall be deemed to be 'abandoned' the following:"'The term "dilution" means the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of --"'(1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties, or"'(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.'" 109 Stat. 985-986. The question we granted  certiorari to decide is  whether objective proof of  actual injury to the economic value of a famous mark (as opposed to a presumption of harm arising from a subjective "likelihood of dilution" standard) is a requisite for relief under the FTDA.

Petitioners, Victor and Cathy Moseley, own and operate a retail store named "Victor's Little Secret" in a strip mall in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They have no employees.

 Respondents are affiliated corporations that own the VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark, and operate over 750 Victoria's Secret stores, two of which are in Louisville, Kentucky, a short drive from Elizabethtown. In 1998 they spent over $ 55 million advertising "the VICTORIA'S SECRET brand--one of moderately priced, high quality, attractively designed lingerie sold in a store setting designed to look like a woman's  bedroom." App. 167, 170. They distribute 400 million copies of the Victoria's Secret catalog each year, including 39,000 in Elizabethtown. In 1998 their sales exceeded $ 1.5 billion.

In the February 12, 1998, edition of a weekly publication distributed to residents of the military installation at Fort Knox, Kentucky, petitioners advertised the "GRAND OPENING Just in time for Valentine's Day!" of their store "VICTOR'S SECRET" in nearby Elizabethtown. The ad featured "Intimate Lingerie for every woman"; "Romantic Lighting"; "Lycra Dresses"; "Pagers"; and "Adult Novelties/Gifts." Id., at 209. An army colonel, who saw the ad and was offended by what he perceived to be an attempt to use a reputable company's trademark to promote the sale of "unwholesome, tawdry merchandise," sent a copy to respondents. Id., at 210. Their counsel then wrote to petitioners stating that their choice of the name "Victor'sSecret" for a store selling lingerie was likely to cause confusion with the well-known VICTORIA'S SECRET mark and, in addition, was likely to "dilute the distinctiveness" of the mark. Id., at 190-191. They requested the immediate discontinuance of the use of the name "and any variations thereof." Ibid. In response, petitioners changed the name of their store to "Victor's Little Secret." Because that change did not satisfy respondents, 2After being advised of a proposal to change the store name to "VICTOR'S LITTLE SECRETS," respondents' counsel requested detailed information about the store in order to consider whether that change "would be acceptable." App. 13-14. Respondents filed suit two months after this request. they promptly filed this action in Federal District Court. 

The complaint contained four separate claims: (1) for trademark infringement alleging that petitioners' use of their trade name was "likely to cause confusion and/or mistake in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1)"; (2) for unfair competition alleging misrepresentation in violation of § 1125(a);  (3) for "federal dilution" in violation of the FTDA; and (4) for trademark infringement and unfair competition in violation of the common law of Kentucky. Id., at 15, 20-23. In the dilution count, the complaint alleged that petitioners' conduct was "likely to blur and erode the distinctiveness"  and "tarnish the reputation" of the VICTORIA'S SECRET trademark. Ibid.

After discovery the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The record contained uncontradicted affidavits and deposition testimony describing the vast size of respondents' business, the value of the VICTORIA'S SECRET name, and descriptions of the items sold in the respective parties' stores. Respondents sell a "complete line of lingerie" and related items, each of which bears a VICTORIA'S SECRET label or tag. 3Respondents described their business as follows: "Victoria's Secret stores sell a complete line of lingerie, women's undergarments and nightwear, robes, caftans and kimonos, slippers, sachets, lingerie bags, hanging bags, candles, soaps, cosmetic brushes, atomizers, bath products and fragrances." Id., at 168. Petitioners  sell a wide variety of items, including adult videos, "adult novelties,  " and lingerie. 4In answer to an interrogatory, petitioners stated that they "sell novelty action clocks, patches, temporary tattoos, stuffed animals, coffee mugs, leather biker wallets, zippo lighters, diet formula, diet supplements, jigsaw puzzles, whyss, handcufs [sic], hosiery bubble machines, greeting cards, calendars, incense burners, car air fresheners, sunglasses, ball caps, jewelry, candles, lava lamps, blacklights, fiber optic lights, rock and roll prints, lingerie, pagers, candy, adult video tapes, adult novelties, t-shirts, etc." Id., at 87. Victor Moseley stated in an affidavit that women's lingerie represented only about five per cent of their sales. Id., at 131. In support of their motion for summary judgment, respondents submitted an affidavit by an expert in marketing who explained "the enormous value" of respondents' mark. Id., at 195-205. Neither he, nor any other witness, expressed any opinion concerning the impact, if any,  of petitioners' use of the name "Victor's Little Secret" on that value. 

Finding that the record contained no evidence of actual confusion between the parties' marks, the District Court concluded that "no likelihood of confusion exists as a matter of law" and entered summary judgment for petitioners on the infringement and unfair competition claims. V Secret Catalogue, Inc. v. Moseley, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5215, Civ. Action No. 3:98CV-395-S (WD Ky., Feb. 9, 2000), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a, 37a. With respect to the FTDA claim, however, the court ruled for respondents.

Noting that petitioners did not challenge Victoria Secret's claim that its mark is "famous," the only question it had to decide was whether petitioners' use of their mark diluted the quality of respondents' mark.  Reasoning from the premise that dilution "corrodes" a trademark either by "'blurring its product identification or by damaging positive associations that have attached to it,'" the court first found the two marks to be sufficiently similar to cause dilution, and then found "that Defendants' mark dilutes Plaintiffs' mark because of its tarnishing effect upon the Victoria's Secret mark." Id., at 38a-39a (quoting Ameritech, Inc. v. American Info. Technologies Corp., 811 F.2d 960, 965 (CA6 1987)). It therefore enjoined petitioners "from using the mark 'Victor's Little Secret' on the basis that it causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the Victoria's Secret mark." App. to Pet. for Cert. 38a-39a. The court did not, however, find that any "blurring" had occurred. Ibid.

 The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  259 F.3d 464 (2001). In a case decided shortly after the entry of the District Court's judgment in this case, the Sixth Circuit had adopted the standards for determining dilution under the FDTA that were enunciated by the Second Circuit in Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., 191 F.3d 208 (1999). See Kellogg Co. v. Exxon Corp., 209 F.3d 562 (CA6 2000). In order to apply those standards, it was necessary to discuss  two issues that the District Court had not specifically addressed -- whether respondents' mark is "distinctive," 5"It is quite clear that the statute intends distinctiveness, in addition to fame, as an essential element. The operative language defining the tort requires that 'the [junior] person's . . . use . . . cause dilution of the distinctive quality of the [senior] mark.' 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1). There can be no dilution of a mark's distinctive quality unless the mark is distinctive." Nabisco, Inc. v. PF Brands, Inc., 191 F.3d 208, 216 (CA2 1999). and whether relief could be granted before dilution has actually occurred. 6The Second Circuit explained why it did not believe "actual dilution" need be proved:"Relying on a recent decision by the Fourth Circuit, Nabisco also asserts that proof of dilution under the FTDA requires proof of an 'actual, consummated harm.' Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Division of Travel Dev., 170 F.3d 449, 464 (4th Cir. 1999). We reject the argument because we disagree with the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the statute."It is not clear which of two positions the Fourth Circuit adopted by its requirement of proof of 'actual dilution.' Id. The narrower position would be that courts may not infer dilution from 'contextual factors (degree of mark and product similarity, etc.),' but must instead rely on evidence of 'actual loss of revenues' or the 'skillfully constructed consumer survey.' Id. at 457, 464-65. This strikes us as an arbitrary and unwarranted limitation on the methods of proof." Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 223. With respect to the first issue,  the court rejected the argument that VICTORIA'S  SECRET could not be distinctive because "secret" is an ordinary word used by hundreds of lingerie concerns. The court concluded that the entire mark was "arbitrary and fanciful" and therefore deserving of a high level of trademark protection.  259 F.3d at 470. 7"In this case, for example, although the word 'secret' may provoke some intrinsic association with prurient interests, it is not automatically linked in the ordinary human experience with lingerie. 'Secret' is not particularly descriptive of bras and hosiery. Nor is there anything about the combination of the possessive 'Victoria's' and 'secret' that automatically conjures thought of women's underwear-except, of course, in the context of plaintiff's line of products. Hence, we conclude that the 'Victoria's Secret' mark ranks with those that are 'arbitrary and fanciful' and is therefore deserving of a high level of trademark protection. Although the district court applied a slightly different test from the one now established in this circuit, the court would undoubtedly have reached the same result under the Nabisco test. Certainly, we cannot say that the court erred in finding that the preliminary factors of a dilution claim had been met by Victoria's Secret." 259 F.3d at 470-471. On  the second issue, the court relied on a distinction suggested by this sentence in the House Report: "Confusion leads to immediate injury, while dilution is an infection, which if allowed to spread, will inevitably destroy the advertising value of the mark." H. R. Rep. No. 104-374, p. 1030 (1995). This statement, coupled with the difficulty of proving actual harm, lent support to the court's ultimate conclusion that the evidence in this case sufficiently established "dilution." 259 F.3d, at 475-477. In sum, the Court of Appeals held:"While no consumer is likely to go to the Moseleys' store expecting to find Victoria's Secret's famed Miracle Bra, consumers who hear the name 'Victor's Little Secret' are likely automatically to think of the more famous store and link it to the Moseleys' adult-toy, gag gift, and lingerie shop. This, then, is a classic instance of dilution by tarnishing (associating the Victoria's Secret name with sex toys and lewd coffee mugs) and by blurring (linking the chain with a single, unauthorized establishment). Given this conclusion, it follows that Victoria's Secret would prevail in a dilution analysis, even without an exhaustive consideration of all ten of the Nabisco factors." Id., at 477. 8The court had previously noted that the "Second Circuit has developed a list of ten factors used to determine if dilution has, in fact, occurred, while describing them as a 'nonexclusive list' to 'develop gradually over time' and with the particular facts of each case. Those factors are: distinctiveness; similarity of the marks; 'proximity of the products and the likelihood of bridging the gap;' 'interrelationship among the distinctiveness of the senior mark, the similarity of the junior mark, and the proximity of the products;' 'shared consumers and geographic limitations;' 'sophistication of consumers;' actual confusion; 'adjectival or referential quality of the junior use;' 'harm to the junior user and delay by the senior user;' and the 'effect of [the] senior's prior laxity in protecting the mark." Id., at 476 (quoting Nabisco, 191 F.3d at 217-222).

In reaching that conclusion the Court of Appeals expressly rejected the holding of the Fourth Circuit in Ringling Bros.-Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Development,170 F.3d 449 (1999). In that case, which involved a claim that Utah's use on its license plates of the phrase "greatest snow on earth" was causing dilution of the "greatest show on earth," the court had concluded "that to establish dilution of a famous mark under the federal Act requires proof that (1) a defendant has made  use of a junior mark sufficiently similar to the famous mark to evoke in a relevant universe of consumers a mental association of the two that (2) has caused (3) actual economic harm to the famous mark's economic value by lessening its former selling power as an advertising agent for its goods or services." Id., at 461 (emphasis added). Because other Circuits have also expressed differing views about the "actual harm" issue, we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  535 U.S. 985, 152 L. Ed. 2d 463, 122 S. Ct. 1536 (2002).

II

Traditional trademark infringement law is a part of the broader law of unfair competition, see Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf,240 U.S. 403, 413, 60 L. Ed. 713, 36 S. Ct. 357, 1916 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 265 (1916), that has its sources in English common law, and was largely  codified in the Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act). See B. Pattishall, D. Hilliard, & J. Welch, Trademarks and Unfair Competition 2 (4th ed. 2000) ("The United States took the [trademark and unfair competition] law of England as its own"). That law broadly prohibits uses of trademarks, trade names, and trade dress that are likely to cause confusion about the source of a product or service. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1125(a)(1)(A). Infringement law protects consumers from being misled by the use of infringing marks and also protects producers from unfair practices by an "imitating competitor." Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.,514 U.S. 159, 163-164, 131 L. Ed. 2d 248, 115 S. Ct. 1300 (1995).

 Because respondents did not appeal the District Court's adverse judgement on counts 1, 2, and 4 of their complaint,  we decide the case on the assumption that the Moseleys' use of the name "Victor's Little Secret" neither confused any consumers or potential consumers, nor was likely to do so. Moreover, the disposition of those counts also makes it appropriate to decide the case on the assumption that there was no significant competition between the adversaries in this case. Neither the absence of any likelihood of confusion nor the absence of competition, however, provides a defense to the statutory dilution claim alleged in count 3 of the complaint.

Unlike traditional infringement law, the prohibitions against trademark dilution are not the product of common-law development, and are not motivated by an interest in protecting consumers. The seminal discussion of dilution is found in Frank Schechter's 1927 law review article concluding "that the preservation of the uniqueness of a trademark should constitute the only rational basis for its protection." Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv. L. Rev. 813, 831. Schechter supported his conclusion by referring to a German case protecting the owner of the well-known trademark "Odol" for mouthwash from use on various noncompeting steel products. 9The German court "held that the use of the mark, 'Odol' even on non-competing goods was 'gegen die guten Sitten,' pointing out that, when the public hears or reads the word 'Odol,' it thinks of the complainant's mouth wash, and that an article designated with the name 'Odol' leads the public to assume that it is of good quality. Consequently, concludes the court, complainant has 'the utmost interest in seeing that its mark is not diluted [verwassert]: it would lose in selling power if everyone used it as the designation of his goods.'" 40 Harv. L. Rev., at 831-832. That case, and indeed the principal focus of the Schechter article, involved an established arbitrary mark that had been "added to rather than withdrawn from the human vocabulary" and an infringement that made use of the identical mark.  Id., at 829. 10Schecter discussed this distinction at length: "The rule that arbitrary, coined or fanciful marks or names should be given a much broader degree of protection than symbols, words or phrases in common use would appear to be entirely sound. Such trademarks or tradenames as 'Blue Ribbon,' used, with or without registration, for all kinds of commodities or services, more than sixty times; 'Simplex' more than sixty times; 'Star,' as far back as 1898, nearly four hundred times; 'Anchor,' already registered over one hundred fifty times in 1898; 'Bull Dog,' over one hundred times by 1923; 'Gold Medal,' sixty-five times; '3-in-1' and '2-in-1,' seventy-nine times; 'Nox-all,' fifty times; 'Universal,' over thirty times; 'Lily White' over twenty times; -- all these marks and names have, at this late date, very little distinctiveness in the public mind, and in most cases suggest merit, prominence or other qualities of goods or services in general, rather than the fact that the product or service, in connection with which the mark or name is used, emanates from a particular source. On the other hand, 'Rolls-Royce,' 'Aunt Jemima's,' 'Kodak,' 'Mazda,' 'Corona,' 'Nujol,' and 'Blue Goose,' are coined, arbitrary or fanciful words or phrases that have been added to rather than withdrawn from the human vocabulary by their owners, and have, from the very beginning, been associated in the public mind with a particular product, not with a variety of products, and have created in the public consciousness an impression or symbol of the excellence of the particular product in question." Id., at 828-829.

   Some 20 years later Massachusetts enacted the first state statute protecting trademarks from dilution. It provided:

"Likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name or trade-mark shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of trade-mark infringement or unfair competition notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services." 1947 Mass. Acts, p. 300, ch. 307.

Notably, that statute, unlike the "Odol" case, prohibited both the likelihood of "injury to business reputation" and "dilution." It thus expressly applied to both "tarnishment" and "blurring." At least 25 States passed similar laws in the decades before the FTDA was enacted in 1995. See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 25, Statutory Note (1995).

III

In 1988, when Congress adopted amendments to the Lanham Act, it gave consideration to an antidilution provision.  During the hearings on the 1988 amendments, objections to that provision based on a concern that it might have applied to expression protected by the First Amendment were voiced and the provision was deleted from the amendments. H. R.  Rep. No. 100-1028 (1988). The bill, H. R. 1295, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., that was introduced in the House in 1995, and ultimately enacted as the FTDA, included two exceptions designed to avoid those concerns: a provision allowing "fair use" of a registered mark in comparative advertising or promotion, and the provision that noncommercial use of a mark shall not constitute dilution. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(4).

 On July 19, 1995, the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property of the House Judiciary Committee held a 1-day hearing on H. R. 1295. No opposition to the bill was voiced at the hearing and, with one minor amendment that extended protection to unregistered as well as registered marks, the subcommittee endorsed the bill and it passed the House unanimously. The committee's report stated that the "purpose of H. R. 1295 is to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it, even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion." H. R. Rep. No. 104-374, p. 1029 (1995). As examples of dilution, it stated that "the use of DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK pianos would be actionable under this legislation." Id., at 1030. In the Senate an identical bill, S. 1513, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., was introduced on December 29, 1995, and passed on the same day by voice vote without any hearings. In his explanation of the bill, Senator Hatch also stated that it was intended "to protect famous trademarks from subsequent  uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it," and referred to the Dupont Shoes, Buick aspirin, and Kodak piano examples, as well as to the Schechter law review article. 141 Cong. Rec. 38559-38561 (1995).

  IV

The VICTORIA'S SECRET mark is unquestionably valuable and petitioners have not challenged the conclusion that it qualifies as a "famous mark" within the meaning of the statute. Moreover, as we understand their submission, petitioners do not contend that the statutory protection is confined to identical uses of famous marks, or that the statute should be construed more narrowly in a case such as this. Even if the legislative history might lend some support to such a contention, it surely is not compelled by the statutory text.

The District Court's decision in this case rested on the conclusion that the name of petitioners' store "tarnished" the reputation of respondents' mark, and the Court of Appeals relied on both "tarnishment" and "blurring" to support its affirmance. Petitioners have not disputed the relevance of tarnishment, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-7, presumably because that concept was prominent in litigation brought under state antidilution statutes and because it was mentioned in the legislative history. Whether it is actually embraced by the statutory text, however, is another matter. Indeed, the contrast between the state statutes, which expressly refer to both "injury to business reputation" and to "dilution of the distinctive quality of a trade name or trademark," and the federal statute which refers only to the latter, arguably supports a narrower reading of the FTDA. See Klieger, Trademark Dilution: The Whittling Away of the Rational Basis for Trademark Protection, 58 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 789, 812-813, and n. 132 (1997).   The contrast between the state statutes and the federal statute, however, sheds light on the precise question that we must decide. For those state statutes, like several provisions in the federal Lanham Act, repeatedly refer to a "likelihood" of harm, rather than to a completed harm. The relevant text of the FTDA, quoted in full in note 1, supra, provides that "the owner of a famous mark" is entitled to injunctive  relief against another person's commercial use of a mark or trade name if that use "causes dilution of the distinctive quality" of the famous mark.  15 U.S.C. § 1125(c)(1) (emphasis added). This text unambiguously requires a showing of actual dilution, rather than a likelihood of dilution.

This conclusion is fortified by the definition of the term "dilution" itself. That definition provides:

"The term 'dilution' means the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of --

"(1) competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties, or

"(2) likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception." § 1127.

The contrast between the initial reference to an actual "lessening of the capacity" of the mark, and the later reference to a "likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception" in the second caveat confirms the conclusion  that actual dilution must be established.Of course, that does not mean that the consequences of dilution, such as an actual loss of sales or profits, must also be proved. To the extent that language in the Fourth Circuit's opinion in the Ringling Bros. case suggests otherwise, see 170 F.3d at 460-465, we disagree. We do agree, however, with that court's conclusion that, at least where the marks at issue are not identical, the mere fact that consumers mentally associate the junior user's mark with a famous mark is not sufficient to establish actionable dilution. As the facts of that case demonstrate, such mental association will not necessarily reduce the capacity of the famous mark to identify the goods of its  owner, the statutory requirement for dilution under the FTDA. For even though Utah drivers may be reminded of the circus when they see a license plate referring to the "greatest snow on earth," it by no means follows that they will associate "the greatest show on earth"  with skiing or snow sports, or associate it less strongly or exclusively with the circus. "Blurring" is not a necessary consequence of mental association. (Nor, for that matter, is "tarnishing.")

The record in this case establishes that an army officer who saw the advertisement of the opening of a store named "Victor'sSecret" did make the mental association with "Victoria's Secret," but it also shows that he did not therefore form any different impression of the store that his wife and daughter had patronized. There is a complete absence of evidence of any lessening of the capacity of the VICTORIA'S SECRET mark to identify and distinguish goods or services sold in Victoria's Secret stores or advertised in its catalogs. The officer was offended by the ad, but it did not change his conception of Victoria's Secret. His offense was directed entirely at petitioners, not at respondents. Moreover, the expert retained by respondents had nothing to say about the impact of petitioners' name on the strength of respondents' mark.

Noting that consumer surveys and other means of demonstrating actual dilution are expensive and often unreliable, respondents and their amici argue that evidence of an actual "lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish goods or services," § 1127, may be difficult to obtain. It may well be, however, that direct evidence of dilution such as consumer surveys will not be necessary if actual dilution can reliably be proven through circumstantial evidence -- the obvious case is one where the junior and senior marks are identical. Whatever difficulties of proof may be entailed, they are not an acceptable reason for dispensing with proof of an essential element of a statutory violation. The evidence in the present record is not sufficient to support the summary judgment on the dilution count. The judgment is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.

 In Lindh v. Murphy,521 U.S. 320, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997), we held that amendments made to chapter 153 of Title 28 of the United States Code by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, do not apply to cases pending in federal court on April 24, 1996 -- AEDPA's effective date. In this case we consider when a capital habeas case becomes "pending" for purposes of the rule announced in Lindh.

I

 Respondent Robert Garceau brutally killed his girlfriend Maureen Bautista and her 14-year-old son, Telesforo Bautista. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court affirmed respondent's conviction and sentence, People v. Garceau, 6 Cal. 4th 140, 862 P.2d 664, 24 Cal. Rptr. 2d 664 (1993), and denied on the merits his petition for state postconviction relief.  We denied certiorari. 513 U.S. 848, 130 L. Ed. 2d 84, 115 S. Ct. 144 (1994).

 On May 12, 1995, respondent filed a motion for the appointment of federal habeas counsel and an application for a stay of execution in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California. The District Court promptly issued a 45-day stay of execution. On June 26, 1995, the District Court appointed counsel and extended the stay of execution for another 120 days. On August 1, 1995, the State filed a motion to vacate the stay, in part because respondent had failed to file a "specification of nonfrivolous issues," as required by local court rules. Brief for Respondent 2. Respondent cured that defect, and, on October 13, 1995, the District Court denied the State's motion and ordered that the habeas petition be filed within nine months. Respondent filed his application for habeas relief on July 2, 1996.

Although respondent's habeas application was filed after AEDPA's effective date, the District Court, following Circuit precedent, concluded that the application was not subject to AEDPA. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-32 (citing Lindh, supra; Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. for the Central Dist. of Cal.,163 F.3d 530, 540 (CA9 1998)  (en banc), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1060, 143 L. Ed. 2d 535, 119 S. Ct. 1377 (1999)). On the merits, however, the District  Court ruled that respondent was not entitled to habeas relief. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Like the District Court, the Ninth Circuit concluded AEDPA does not apply to respondent's application. 275 F.3d 769, 772, n. 1 (2001). Unlike the District Court, however, the Ninth Circuit granted habeas relief for reasons that are not relevant to our discussion here. Id., at 777-778. We granted certiorari. 536 U.S. 990, 53 L. Ed. 2d 893, 123 S. Ct. 32 (2001).

IIAs already noted, we held in Lindh that the new provisions of chapter 153 of Title 28 do not apply to cases pending as of the date AEDPA became effective. Lindh, however, had no occasion to elaborate on the precise time when a case becomes "pending" for purposes of chapter 153 because in that case petitioner's habeas application had been filed prior to AEDPA's effective date. See Lindh, supra, at 323 (noting that petitioner filed his federal habeas application on July 9, 1992). Since Lindh, the Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether AEDPA applies to a habeas application filed after AEDPA's effective date if the applicant sought the appointment of counsel or a stay of execution (or both) prior to that date. Five Courts of Appeals have ruled that AEDPA applies, see, e.g., Isaacs v. Head, 300 F.3d 1232, 1245-1246 (CA11 2002); Moore v. Gibson,195 F.3d 1152, 1160-1163 (CA10 1999); Gosier v. Welborn,175 F.3d 504, 506 (CA7 1999); Williams v. Coyle,167 F.3d 1036, 1037-1040 (CA6 1999); Williams v. Cain,125 F.3d 269, 273-274 (CA5 1997), while the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held it does not, Calderon, supra, at 539-540. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the majority of the Courts of Appeals.

Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 386, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389, 120 S. Ct. 1495 (2000) (opinion of STEVENS, J.) ("Congress wished to curb delays, to prevent 'retrials' on federal habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law"); see also id., at 404 (majority opinion), and "to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism," Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436, 146 L. Ed. 2d 435, 120 S. Ct. 1479 (2000). One of the methods Congress used to advance these objectives was the adoption of an amended 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Williams, 529 U.S., at 404 ("It cannot be disputed that Congress viewed § 2254(d)(1) as an important means by which its goals for habeas reform would be achieved"). As we have explained before, § 2254(d) places "new constraints on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court." Id., at 412. Our cases make clear that AEDPA in general and § 2254(d) in particular focus in large measure on revising the standards used for evaluating the merits of a habeas application. See id., at 412-413; Lindh, 521 U.S., at 329 (noting that "amended § 2254(d) . . . governs standards affecting entitlement to relief"); see also  Early v. Packer, 537 U.S.    , 537 U.S. 3, 154 L. Ed. 2d 263, 123 S. Ct. 362 (2002) (per curiam) (applying AEDPA's standards);  Woodford v. Visciotti,537 U.S.    , 537 U.S. 19, 154 L. Ed. 2d 279, 123 S. Ct. 357 (2002) (per curiam) (same).

Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standards governing the review of the merits of a habeas application,  we interpret the rule announced in Lindh in view of that emphasis, as have the majority of the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F.3d 876, 880 (CA7 1997) ("The motion for counsel is not itself a petition, because it does not call for (or even permit) a decision on the merits. And it is 'the merits'  that the amended § 2254(d)(1) is all about"); Isaacs, supra, at 1245 (same); Coyle, supra, at 1040 (same). Thus, whether AEDPA applies to a state prisoner turns on what was before a federal court on the date AEDPA became effective. If, on that date, the state prisoner had before a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims, then amended § 2254(d) does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant -- such as, for example, a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay of execution -- were presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA's effective date.

A review of the amended chapter 153 supports our conclusion. For instance, § 2254(e)(1) provides that, "in a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct." (Emphasis added.) Under the Ninth Circuit's view, the presumption established in § 2254(e)(1) would rarely apply in a capital case. If, as the Ninth Circuit held, a capital habeas case can be commenced (and, therefore, may become pending for purposes of Lindh) with the filing of a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay, then § 2254(e)(1), which by its terms applies only to a proceeding "instituted" by "an application for a writ of habeas corpus," would not apply to any capital prisoners whose first filing in federal court is a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay. This would make § 2254(e)(1) applicable only to those capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not  seek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indication that § 2254(e)(1) was intended to have such a limited scope. Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for a capital prisoner to avoid the application of the stringent requirements of § 2254(e)(1) simply by filing a request for counsel or a motion for a stay before filing an actual application for habeas relief. Other provisions of chapter 153 likewise support our view. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d) (indicating that the power to grant a writ is not triggered except by "application for a writ of habeas corpus"); § 2244(a) (providing that federal judges are not required to "entertain" a second or successive "application for a writ of habeas corpus" except as provided for by statute). Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the procedural rules governing § 2254 cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 explains that "[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint." The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 11; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Pitchess v. Davis,421 U.S. 482, 489, 44 L. Ed. 2d 317, 95 S. Ct. 1748 (1975) (per curiam). Nothing in the Habeas Corpus Rules contradicts Rule 3. The logical conclusion, therefore, is that a habeas suit begins with the filing of an application for habeas corpus relief -- the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case.

III

Respondent asks us to determine the scope of the rule announced in Lindh by looking at some of the provisions of chapter 154 of Title 28. But our task in this case is to apply Lindh to an action under chapter 153; thus, the precise phrasing of provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite to our inquiry here.

 Moreover, respondent's argument that our holding in McFarland v. Scott,512 U.S. 849, 129 L. Ed. 2d 666, 114 S. Ct. 2568 (1994), should inform our decision here is unpersuasive. To begin with, McFarland involved  the interpretation of § 2251, not § 2254, which is at issue here. And, as the Courts of Appeals have recognized, see Isaacs, 300 F.3d at 1242-1246 (collecting and discussing authorities), the Court's ruling in McFarland must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right to counsel contained in 21 U.S.C. § 848(q)(4)(B). McFarland,512 U.S., at 855 ("This interpretation is the only one that gives meaning to the statute as a practical matter"); id., at 856 ("Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceed without counsel in order to obtain counsel thus would expose him to the substantial risk that his habeas claims never would be heard on the merits. Congress legislated against this legal backdrop in adopting § 848(q)(4)(B), and we safely assume that it did not intend for the express requirement of counsel to be defeated in this manner"); id., at 857 ("Even if the District Court had granted McFarland's motion for appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to represent him, this appointment would have been meaningless unless McFarland's execution also was stayed"). Thus, McFarland cannot carry the day for respondent.

Similarly, the Ninth Circuit's and respondent's reliance on Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 141 L. Ed. 2d 242, 118 S. Ct. 1969 (1998), is misplaced. In Hohn, we considered whether this Court has jurisdiction to review a court of appeals' denial of a certificate of appealability (COA). To answer that question we focused on the text of 28 U.S.C. § 1254, which "confines our jurisdiction to 'cases in' the courts of appeals." Hohn, supra, at 241 (citing Nixon v. Fitzgerald,457 U.S. 731, 741-742, 73 L. Ed. 2d 349, 102 S. Ct. 2690 (1982)). Although we concluded that an application for a COA constituted a case within the meaning of § 1254, we did not provide an all-purpose definition of the term "case." Thus, while Hohn might support an argument that respondent's request for appointment of counsel and his motion for a stay of execution began a "case" that could be reviewed on appeal, see, e.g., Gosier,175 F.3d at 506 ("[A] request for counsel is a 'case' in the sense that it is subject to appellate review (and,  if need be, review by the Supreme Court)"), it says nothing about whether a request for counsel or motion for a stay suffices to create a "case" that is "pending" within the meaning of the Lindh rule.

* * *

In sum, we hold that, for purposes of applying the rule announced in Lindh, a case does not become "pending" until an actual application for habeas corpus relief is filed in federal court. Because respondent's federal habeas corpus application was not filed until after AEDPA's effective date, that application is subject to AEDPA's amendments. 1JUSTICE O'CONNOR contends that we may have misapplied our test because a filing labeled "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues" placed the merits of respondent's claims before the District Court before AEDPA's effective date. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). That is simply not so. Respondent's "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues" plainly stated that "based on a preliminary review of case materials, counsel believes the following federal constitutional issues exist in this case and are among the issues that may be raised on [Garceau's] behalf in a petition for habeas corpus." App. to Brief in Opposition 227 (emphasis added). The clear import of this language is that the filing itself did not seek any relief on the merits or place the merits of respondent's claims before the District Court for decision. Rather, the document simply alerted the District Court as to some of the possible claims that might be raised by respondent in the future. Indeed, the habeas corpus application respondent eventually filed contained numerous issues that were not mentioned in the "Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues." Accordingly, we reverse the judgment  of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 2In view of the question on which we granted certiorari, we decline petitioner's request to rule on the merits of respondent's habeas application.



It is so ordered. 


JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.

In 1995, the city of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio (hereinafter City), submitted to voters a facially neutral referendum petition that called for the repeal of a municipal housing ordinance authorizing construction of a low-income housing complex. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found genuine issues of material fact with regard to whether the City violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the Fair Housing Act, 82 Stat. 81, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., by placing the petition on the ballot. We granted certiorari to determine whether the Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that respondents' suit against the City could proceed to trial.

I

A

In June 1995, respondents Buckeye Community Hope Foundation, a nonprofit corporation dedicated to developing affordable housing through the use of low-income tax credits, and others (hereinafter Buckeye or respondents), purchased land zoned for apartments in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. In February 1996, Buckeye submitted a site plan for Pleasant Meadows, a multifamily, low-income housing complex, to the city planning commission. Residents of Cuyahoga Falls immediately expressed opposition to the proposal. See  Buckeye Cmty. Hope Found. v. City of Cuyahoga Falls, 263 F.3d 627, 630 (CA6 2001). After respondents agreed to various conditions, including that it build an earthen wall surrounded by a fence on one side of the complex, the commission unanimously approved the site plan and submitted it to the city council for final authorization.

 As the final approval process unfolded, public opposition to the plan resurfaced and eventually coalesced into a referendum  petition drive. See Cuyahoga Falls City Charter, Art. 9, § 2 (hereinafter City Charter), App. 14 (giving voters "the power to approve or reject at the polls any ordinance or resolution passed by the Council" within 30 days of the ordinance's passage). At city council meetings and independent gatherings, some of which the mayor attended to express his personal opposition to the site plan, citizens of Cuyahoga Falls voiced various concerns: that the development would cause crime and drug activity to escalate, that families with children would move in, and that the complex would attract a population similar to the one on Prange Drive, the City's only African-American neighborhood. See, e.g., 263  F.3d at 636-637; App. 98, 139, 191; Tr. 182-185, 270, 316. Nevertheless, because the plan met  all municipal zoning requirements, the city council approved the project on April 1, 1996, through City Ordinance No. 48-1996.

On April 29, a group of citizens filed a formal petition with the City requesting that the ordinance be repealed or submitted to a popular vote. Pursuant to the City Charter, which provides that an ordinance challenged by a petition "shall [not] go into effect until approved by a majority" of voters, the filing stayed the implementation of the site plan. Art. 9, § 2, App. 15. On April 30, respondents sought an injunction against the petition in state court, arguing that the Ohio Constitution does not authorize popular referendums on administrative matters. On May 31, the Court of Common Pleas denied the injunction. Buckeye Community Hope Foundationv. Cuyahoga Falls, Civ. No. 96-05-1701, (Summit County), App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a. A month later, respondents nonetheless requested building permits from the City in order to begin construction. On June 26, the city engineer rejected the request after being advised by the city law director that the permits "could not be issued because the site plan ordinance 'does not take effect' due to the petitions." 263 F.3d at 633.

In November 1996, the voters of Cuyahoga Falls passed the referendum, thus repealing Ordinance No. 48-1996. In  a joint stipulation, however, the parties agreed that the results of the election would not be certified until the litigation over the referendum was resolved. See Stipulation and Jointly Agreed upon Preliminary Injunction Order in No. 5:96 CV 1458 (ND Ohio, Nov. 25, 1996). In July 1998, the Ohio Supreme Court, having initially concluded that the referendum was proper, reversed itself and declared the referendum unconstitutional. Buckeye Community Hope Foundation v. Cuyahoga Falls, 82 Ohio St. 3d 539, 697 N.E.2d 181 (holding that the Ohio State Constitution authorizes referendums only in relation to legislative acts, not administrative acts, such as the site-plan ordinance). The City subsequently issued the building permits, and Buckeye commenced construction of Pleasant Meadows.

B

In July 1996, with the state-court litigation still pending, respondents filed suit in federal court against the City and several city officials, seeking an injunction ordering the City to issue the building permits, as well as declaratory and monetary relief. Buckeye alleged that "in allowing a site plan approval ordinance to be submitted to the electors of Cuyahoga Falls through a referendum and in rejecting [its] application for building permits," the City and its officials violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3601. Complaint in No. 5:96 CV 1458 P1 (ND Ohio, July 5, 1996) (hereinafter Complaint). In June 1997, the District Court dismissed the case against the mayor in his individual capacity but denied the City's motion for summary judgment on the equal protection and due process claims, concluding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to both claims.  Buckeye Community Hope Found. v. City of Cuyahoga Falls, 970 F. Supp. 1289, 1308 (ND Ohio 1997). After the Ohio Supreme Court declared the referendum invalid in 1998, thus reducing respondents' action to a  claim for damages for the delay in construction, the City and its officials again moved for summary judgment. On November  19, 1999, the District Court granted the motion on all counts. Civ. No. 5:96 CV 1458, App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.

 The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed. As to respondents' equal protection claim, the court concluded that they had produced sufficient evidence to go to trial on the allegation that the City, by allowing the referendum petition to stay the implementation of the site plan, gave effect to the racial bias reflected in the public's opposition to the project. See263 F.3d at 639. The court then held that even if respondents failed to prove intentional discrimination, they stated a valid claim under the Fair Housing Act on the theory that the City's actions had a disparate impact based on race and family status. See Id., at 640. Finally, the court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the City, by denying respondents the benefit of the lawfully approved site plan, engaged in arbitrary and irrational government conduct in violation of substantive due process. Id., at 644. We granted certiorari, 536 U.S. , 536 U.S. 938, 153 L. Ed. 2d 802, 122 S. Ct. 2618 (2002), and now reverse the constitutional holdings and vacate the Fair Housing Act holding.

II

Respondents allege that by submitting the petition to the voters and refusing to issue building permits while the petition was pending, the City and its officials violated the Equal Protection Clause. See Complaint P41. Petitioners claim that the Sixth Circuit went astray by ascribing the motivations of a handful of citizens supportive of the referendum to the City. We agree with petitioners that respondents have failed to present sufficient evidence of an equal protection violation to survive summary judgment.

 We have made clear that "proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required" to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,429 U.S. 252, 265, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450, 97 S. Ct. 555 (1977) (citing Washington v. Davis,426 U.S. 229, 48 L. Ed. 2d 597, 96 S. Ct. 2040 (1976)). In deciding  the equal protection question, the Sixth Circuit erred in relying on cases in which we have subjected enacted, discretionary measures to equal protection scrutiny and treated decisionmakers' statements as evidence of such intent. See 263 F.3d, at 634-635 (citing Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,473 U.S. 432, 448, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313, 105 S. Ct. 3249 (1985); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., supra, at 268; and Hunter v. Erickson,393 U.S. 385, 392, 21 L. Ed. 2d 616, 89 S. Ct. 557 (1969)). Because respondents claim injury from the referendum petitioning process and not from the referendum itself -- which never went into effect -- these cases are inapposite. Ultimately, neither of the official acts respondents challenge reflects the intent required to support equal protection liability.

First, in submitting the referendum petition to the voters, the City acted pursuant to the requirements of its charter, which sets out a facially neutral petitioning procedure. See Art. 9, § 2. By placing the referendum on the ballot, the City did not enact the referendum and  therefore cannot be said to have given effect to voters' allegedly discriminatory motives for supporting the petition. Similarly, the city engineer, in refusing to issue the building permits while the referendum was still pending, performed a nondiscretionary, ministerial act. He acted in response to the city law director's instruction that the building permits "could not . . . issue" because the City Charter prohibited a challenged site-plan ordinance from going into effect until "approved by a majority of those voting thereon," ibid. See 263 F.3d at 633. Respondents point to no evidence suggesting that these official acts were themselves motivated by racial animus. Respondents do not, for example, offer evidence that the City followed the obligations set forth in its charter because of the referendum's discriminatory purpose, or that city officials would have selectively refused to follow standard charter procedures in a different case.Instead, to establish discriminatory intent, respondents and the Sixth Circuit both rely heavily on evidence of allegedly  discriminatory voter sentiment. See id., at 635-637. But statements made by private individuals in the course of a  citizen-driven petition drive, while sometimes relevant to equal protection analysis, see supra, at 5, do not, in and of themselves, constitute state action for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.Cf. Blum v. Yaretsky,457 U.S. 991, 1002-1003, 73 L. Ed. 2d 534, 102 S. Ct. 2777 (1982) ("'The principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States'") (quoting Shelley v. Kraemer,334 U.S. 1, 13, 92 L. Ed. 1161, 68 S. Ct. 836 (1948)). Moreover, respondents put forth no evidence that the "private motives [that] triggered" the referendum drive "can fairly be attributable to the State." Blum v. Yaretsky, supra, at 1004. In fact, by adhering to charter procedures, city officials enabled public debate on the referendum to take place, thus advancing significant First Amendment interests. In assessing the referendum as a "basic instrument of democratic government," Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc.,426 U.S. 668, 679, 49 L. Ed. 2d 132, 96 S. Ct. 2358 (1976), we have observed that "provisions for referendums demonstrate devotion to democracy, not to bias, discrimination, or prejudice," James v. Valtierra,402 U.S. 137, 141, 28 L. Ed. 2d 678, 91 S. Ct. 1331 (1971). And our well established First Amendment admonition that "government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable," Texas v. Johnson,491 U.S. 397, 414, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342, 109 S. Ct. 2533 (1989), dovetails with the notion that all citizens, regardless of the content of their ideas, have the right to petition their government. Cf. Meyer v. Grant,486 U.S. 414, 421-422, 100 L. Ed. 2d 425, 108 S. Ct. 1886 (1988) (describing the circulation of an initiative petition as "'core political speech'");  Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 33 L. Ed. 2d 212, 92 S. Ct. 2286 (1972) ("Government may not grant the use of a forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those wishing to express less  favored or more controversial views"). Again, statements made by decisionmakers or referendum sponsors during deliberation over a  referendum may constitute relevant evidence of discriminatory intent in a challenge to an ultimately enacted initiative. See, e.g., Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1,458 U.S. 457, 471, 73 L. Ed. 2d 896, 102 S. Ct. 3187 (1982) (considering statements of initiative sponsors in subjecting enacted referendum to equal protection scrutiny); Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,429 U.S., at 268. But respondents do not challenge an enacted referendum.

In their brief to this Court, respondents offer an alternate theory of equal protection liability: that city officials, including the mayor, acted in concert with private citizens to prevent Pleasant Meadows from being built because of the race and family status of its likely residents. See Brief for Respondents 12-26; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34, 36-40, 43. Respondents allege, among other things, that the city law director prompted disgruntled voters to file the petition, that the city council intentionally delayed its deliberations to thwart the development, and that the mayor stoked the public opposition. See Brief for Respondents 17. Not only did the courts below not directly address this theory of liability, but respondents also appear to have disavowed this claim at oral argument, focusing instead on the denial of the permits. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37-38.

What is more, respondents never articulated a cognizable legal claim on these grounds. Respondents fail to show that city officials exercised any power over voters' decisionmaking during the drive, much less the kind of "coercive power" either "overt or covert" that would render the voters' actions and statements, for all intents and purposes, state action. Blum v. Yaretsky,457 U.S., at 1004. Nor, as noted above, do respondents show that the voters' sentiments can be attributed in any way to the state actors against which it has brought suit. See ibid. Indeed, in finding a genuine issue of material fact with regard to intent, the Sixth Circuit relied almost entirely on apparently independent statements by private citizens. See 263 F.3d at 635-637. And in dismissing the claim against the mayor in his individual capacity, the District Court found no evidence that he orchestrated the referendum. See 970 F. Supp. , at 1321. Respondents thus fail to present an equal protection claim sufficient to survive summary judgment.

IIIIn evaluating respondents' substantive due process claim, the Sixth Circuit found, as a threshold matter, that respondents had a legitimate claim of entitlement to the building permits, and therefore a property interest in those permits, in light of the city council's approval of the site plan. See 263 F.3d at 642. The court then held that respondents had presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on their claim that the City engaged in arbitrary conduct by denying respondents the benefit of the plan. Id., at 644. Both in their complaint and before this Court, respondents contend that the City violated substantive due process, not only for the reason articulated by the Sixth Circuit, but also on the grounds that the  City's submission of an administrative land-use determination to the charter's referendum procedures constituted per se arbitrary conduct. See Complaint PP39, 43; Brief for Respondents 32-49. We find no merit in either claim.

 We need not decide whether respondents possessed a property interest in the building permits, because the city engineer's refusal to issue the permits while the petition was pending in no sense constituted egregious or arbitrary government conduct. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis,523 U.S. 833, 846, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043, 118 S. Ct. 1708 (1998) (noting that in our evaluations of "abusive executive action," we have held that "only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be 'arbitrary in the constitutional sense'"). In light of the charter's provision that "no such ordinance [challenged by a petition] shall go into effect until approved by a majority of those voting  thereon," Art. 9, § 2, App. 15, the law director's instruction to the engineer to not issue the permits represented an eminently rational directive. Indeed, the site plan, by law, could not be implemented until the voters passed on the referendum.Respondents' second theory of liability has no basis in our precedent. As a matter of federal constitutional law, we have rejected the distinction that respondents ask us to draw, and that the Ohio Supreme Court drew as a matter of state law, between legislative and administrative referendums. In Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc.,426 U.S., at 672, 675, we made clear that because all power stems from the people, "[a] referendum cannot . . . be characterized as a delegation of power," unlawful unless accompanied by "discernible standards." The people retain the power to govern through referendum "'with respect to any matter, legislative or administrative, within the realm of local affairs.'" Id., at 674, n. 9. Cf. James v. Valtierra,402 U.S., at 137. Though the "substantive result" of a referendum may be invalid if it is "arbitrary and capricious," Eastlake v. Forest City Enterprises, supra, at 676, respondents do not challenge the referendum itself. The subjection of the site-plan ordinance to the City's referendum process, regardless of whether that ordinance reflected an administrative or legislative decision, did not constitute per se arbitrary government conduct in violation of due process.

IVFor the reasons detailed above, we reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment with  regard to respondents' equal protection and substantive due process claims. The Sixth Circuit also held that respondents' disparate impact claim under the Fair Housing Act could proceed to trial, 263 F.3d at 641, but respondents have now abandoned the claim. See Brief for Respondents 31. We therefore vacate the Sixth Circuit's  disparate impact holding and remand with instructions to dismiss, with prejudice, the relevant portion of the complaint. See Deakins v. Monaghan,484 U.S. 193, 200, 98 L. Ed. 2d 529, 108 S. Ct. 523 (1988).

 The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is, accordingly, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the case is remanded  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

The State of Washington, like every other State in the Union, uses interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA) to pay for legal services provided to the needy. Some IOLTA programs were created by statute, but in Washington, as in most other States, the IOLTA program was established by the State Supreme Court pursuant to its authority to regulate the practice of law. In Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.S. 156, 141 L. Ed. 2d 174, 118 S. Ct. 1925 (1998), a case involving the Texas IOLTA program, we held "that the interest income generated by funds held in IOLTA accounts is the 'private property' of the owner of the principal." Id., at 172. We did not, however, express any opinion on the question whether the income had been "taken" by the State or "as to the amount of 'just compensation,' if any, due respondents." Ibid. We now confront those questions.

I

As we explained in Phillips, id., at 160-161, in the course of their legal practice, attorneys are frequently required to hold clients' funds for various lengths of time. It has long been recognized that they have a professional and fiduciary obligation to avoid commingling their clients' money with  their own, but it is not unethical to pool several clients' funds in a single trust account. Before 1980 client funds were typically held in non-interest-bearing federally insured checking accounts. Because federal banking regulations in effect since the Great Depression prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts, the value of the use of the clients' money in such accounts inured to the banking institutions.

In 1980, Congress authorized federally insured banks to pay interest on a limited category of demand deposits referred to as "NOW accounts." See 87 Stat. 342, 12 U.S.C. § 1832. This category includes deposits made by individuals and charitable organizations, but does not include those made by for-profit corporations or partnerships unless the deposits are made pursuant to a program under which  charitable organizations have "the exclusive right to the interest." 1Letter from Federal Reserve Board General Counsel Michael Bradfield to Donald Middlebrooks (Oct. 15, 1981), reprinted in Middlebrooks, The Interest on Trust Accounts Program: Mechanics of Its Operation, 56 Fla. B. J. 115, 117 (1982).

In response to the change in federal law, Florida adopted the first IOLTA program in 1981 authorizing the use of NOW accounts for the deposit of client funds, and providing that all of the interest on such accounts be used for charitable purposes. Every State in the Nation and the District of Columbia have followed Florida's lead and adopted an IOLTA program, either through their legislatures or their highest courts. 2Five IOLTA programs were adopted by state legislatures. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. § 6211(a) (West 1990); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 51-81c (Supp. 2002); Md. Bus. Occ. & Prof. Code Ann. § 10-303 (2000); N. Y. Jud. Law § 497 (West Supp. 2003); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 4705.09(A)(1) (Anderson 2000). The remaining programs are governed by rules adopted by the highest court in the State. See Ala.

Acts ch. 93 (making lawyer participation in the IOLTA program optional rather than mandatory by adding Va. Code Ann. § 54.1-3915.1 (2002)). In Indiana, the program was created by legislation but was struck down by the Indiana Supreme Court as an impermissible encroachment on the court's power to regulate the practice of law. See In re Public Law No. 154-1990, 561 N.E.2d 791 (1990). Later, the Indiana Supreme Court adopted an IOLTA program. See Ind. Rule Prof. Conduct 1.15(d) (2000); Remondini, IOLTA Arrives in Indiana: Trial Judges to Play Key Role in Pro Bono Plan, 41 Res Gestae 9 (1998). Likewise, in Pennsylvania, the state legislature passed the original program but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court took over the program in 1996, suspending the state statute and amending the Rules of Professional Conduct to require attorney participation in IOLTA. See A. Azen, Building a Base for Pro Bono in Pennsylvania, 24 Pa. Law. 28 (Mar.-Apr. 2002).Petitioners appear to suggest that a different constitutional analysis might apply to a legislative program than to one adopted by the State's judiciary. See Brief for Petitioners 23, n. 7; Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-51. We assume, however, that the procedure followed by the State when promulgating its IOLTA Rules is irrelevant to the takings issue. The result is that, whereas before  1980 the banks  retained the value of the use of the money deposited in non-interest-bearing client trust accounts, today, because of the adoption  of IOLTA programs, that value is transferred to  charitable entities providing legal services for the poor. The aggregate value of those contributions in 2001 apparently exceeded $ 200 million. 3See Brief for AARP et al. as Amici Curiae 11 (citing ABA Commission on Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, IOLTA Handbook 98, 208 (Jan. 1995, updated July 2002)).

In 1984, the Washington Supreme Court established its IOLTA program by amending its Rules of Professional Conduct.  IOLTA Adoption Order, 102 Wn. 2d 1101. The amendments were adopted after over two years of deliberation, during which the court received hundreds of public comments and heard oral argument from the Seattle-King County Bar Association, designated to represent the proponents of the Rule, and the Walla Walla County Bar Association, designated to represent the opponents of the Rule.

In its opinion explaining the order, the court noted that earlier Rules had required attorneys to hold client trust funds  "in accounts separate from their own funds," id., at 1102, and had prohibited the use of such funds for the lawyer's own pecuniary advantage, but did not address the question whether or how such funds should be invested. Commenting on then-prevalent practice the court observed:

"In conformity with trust law, however, lawyers usually invest client trust funds in separate interest-bearing accounts and pay the interest to the clients whenever the trust funds are large enough in amount or to be held for a long enough period of time to make such investments economically feasible, that is, when the amount of interest earned exceeds the bank charges and costs of setting up the account. However, when trust funds are so nominal in amount or to be held for so short a period that the amount of interest that could be earned would not justify the cost of creating separate accounts, most attorneys simply deposit the funds in a single noninterest-bearing trust checking account containing all such trust funds from all their clients. The funds in such accounts earn no interest for either the client or the attorney. The banks, in contrast, have received the interest-free use of client money." Ibid.

The court then described the four essential features of its IOLTA program: (a) the requirement that all client funds be deposited in interest-bearing trust accounts, (b) the requirement that funds that cannot earn net interest for the client be deposited in an IOLTA account,  (c) the requirement that the lawyers direct the banks to pay the net interest on the IOLTA accounts to the Legal Foundation of Washington (Foundation), and (d) the requirement that the Foundation must use all funds received from IOLTA accounts for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes. It explained:

 "1. All client funds paid to any Washington lawyer or law firm must be deposited in identifiable interest-bearing trust accounts separate from any accounts containing non-trust money of the lawyer or law firm. The program is mandatory for all Washington lawyers. New CPR DR 9-102(A).

"2. The new rule provides for two kinds of interest-bearing trust  accounts. The first type of account bears interest to be paid, net of any transaction costs, to the client. This type of account may be in the form of either separate accounts for each client or a single pooled account with subaccounting to determine how much interest is earned for each client. The second type of account is a pooled interest-bearing account with the interest to be paid directly by the financial institution  to the Legal Foundation of Washington (hereinafter the Foundation), a nonprofit entity to be established pursuant to the order following this opinion. New CPR DR 9-102(C)(1), (2).

"3. Determining whether client funds should be deposited in accounts bearing interest for the benefit of the client or the Foundation is left to the discretion of each lawyer, but the new rule specifies that the lawyer shall base his decision solely on whether the funds could be invested to provide a positive net return to the client. This determination is made by considering several enumerated factors: the amount of interest the funds would earn during the period they are expected to be deposited, the cost of establishing and administering the account, and the capability of financial institutions to calculate and pay interest to individual clients. New CPR DR 9-102(C)(3).

. . . . .

 "5. Lawyers and law firms must direct the depository institution to pay interest or dividends, net of any service charges or fees, to the Foundation, and to send certain regular reports to the Foundation and the lawyer or law firm depositing the funds. New CPR DR 9-102(C)(4).

 "The Foundation must use all funds received from lawyers' trust accounts for tax-exempt law-related charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as directed by this court. See Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Legal Foundation of Washington, 100 Wash. 2d, Advance Sheet 13, at ii, vi (1984)." Id., at 1102-1104.

In its opinion the court responded to three objections that are relevant to our inquiry in this case. First, it rejected the contention that the new program "constitutes an unconstitutional  taking of property without due process or just compensation." Id., at 1104. Like other State Supreme Courts that had considered the question, it distinguished our decision in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,449 U.S. 155, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358, 101 S. Ct. 446 (1980), on the ground that the new "'program creates income where there had been none before, and the income thus created would never benefit the client under any set of circumstances.'" 102 Wash. 2d, at 1108 (quoting In re Interest on Trust Accounts, 402 So. 2d 389, 395 (Fla. 1981)).

Second, it rejected the argument that it was unethical for lawyers to rely on any factor other than the client's best interests when deciding whether to deposit funds in an IOLTA account rather than an account that would generate interest for the client. The court endorsed, and added emphasis, to the response  to that argument set forth in the proponents' reply brief:

"'Although the proposed amendments list several factors an attorney should consider in deciding how to invest his clients' trust funds, . . . all of these factors are really facets of a single question: Can the client's money be invested so that it will produce a net benefit for the client? If so, the attorney must invest it to earn interest for the client. Only if the money cannot earn net interest for the client is the money to go into an IOLTA account.'

"Reply Brief of Proponents, at 14. This is a correct statement of an attorney's duty under trust law, as well as a proper interpretation of the proposed rule as published for public comment. However, in order to make it even clearer that IOLTA funds are only those funds that cannot, under any circumstances, earn net interest (after deducting transaction and administrative costs and bank fees) for the client, we have amended the proposed rule accordingly. See new CPR DR 9-102(C)(3). The new rule makes it absolutely clear that the enumerated  factors are merely facets of the ultimate question of whether client funds could be invested profitably for the benefit of clients. If they can, then investment for the client is mandatory." 102 Wash. 2d, at 1113-1114.

The court also rejected the argument that it had failed to consider the significance of advances in computer technology that, in time, may convert IOLTA participation into an unconstitutional taking of property that could have been distributed to the client. It pointed to the fact that the Rule expressly requires attorneys to give consideration to the capability of financial institutions to calculate and pay interest on individual accounts, and added: "Thus, as cost effective subaccounting services become available, making it possible to earn net interest for clients on increasingly smaller amounts held for increasingly shorter periods of time, more trust money will have to be invested for the clients' benefit under the new rule. The rule is therefore self-adjusting and is adequately designed to accommodate changes in banking technology without running afoul of the state or federal constitutions." Id., at 1114.

Given the court's explanation of its Rule, it seems apparent that a lawyer who mistakenly uses an IOLTA account as a depositary for money that could earn interest for the client would violate the Rule.  Hence, the lawyer will be liable to the client for any lost interest, however minuscule the amount might be.

In 1995, the Washington Supreme Court amended its IOLTA Rules to make them applicable to Limited Practice Officers (LPOs) as well as lawyers. LPOs are non-lawyers who are licensed to act as escrowees in the closing of real estate transactions. Like lawyers, LPOs often temporarily control the funds of clients.

II

This action was commenced by a public interest law firm and four citizens to enjoin state officials from continuing to  require LPOs to deposit trust funds into IOLTA accounts. Because the Court of Appeals held that the firm and two of the  individuals do not have standing, 4The firm is the Washington Legal Foundation, "a nonprofit public interest law and policy center with members and supporters nationwide, [that] devotes a substantial portion of its resources to protecting the speech and property rights of individuals from undue government interference." App. 13. The two individuals found to have no standing are LPOs who alleged that the 1995 amendment adversely affected their earnings because banks that had previously provided them with special services no longer did so; they did not allege that any of their own funds had been "taken."Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, 271 F.3d 835, 848-850 (CA9 2001), and since that holding was not challenged in this Court, we limit our discussion to the claims asserted by petitioners Allen Brown and Greg Hayes. The defendants, respondents in this Court, are the justices of the Washington Supreme Court, the Foundation, which receives and redistributes the interest on IOLTA accounts, and the president of the Foundation.

 In their amended complaint, Brown and Hayes describe the IOLTA program, with particular reference to its application to LPOs and to some of the activities of Recipient Organizations that have received funds from the Foundation. Brown and Hayes also both allege that they regularly purchase and sell real estate and in the course of such transactions they deliver funds to LPOs who are required to deposit them in IOLTA accounts. They object to having the interest on those funds "used to finance the Recipient Organizations" and "to anyone other than themselves receiving the interest derived from those funds." App. 25. The first count of their complaint alleges that "being forced to associate with the Recipient Organizations" violates their First Amendment rights, id., at 25, 27-28; the second count alleges that the "taking" of the interest earned on their funds in the IOLTA accounts violates the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment,id., at 28-29; and the third count alleges that the requirement that client funds be placed in IOLTA accounts is "an illegal taking of the beneficial use of those funds." Id., at 29. The prayer for relief sought a refund of interest earned on the plaintiffs' money that had been placed in IOLTA accounts, a declaration that the IOLTA Rules are unconstitutional, and an injunction against their enforcement against LPOs. See id., at 30.

Most of the pretrial discovery related to the question of whether the 1995 Amendment to the IOLTA Rules had indirectly lessened the earnings of LPOs because LPOs no longer receive certain credits that the banks had provided them when banks retained the interest earned on escrowed funds. Each of the petitioners, however, did identify a specific transaction in which interest on his escrow deposit was paid to the Foundation.

Petitioner Hayes and a man named Fossum made an earnest money deposit of $ 2,000 on August 14, 1996, and a further payment of $ 12,793.32 on August 28, 1996, in connection with a real estate purchase that was closed on August 30, 1996. Id., at 117-118. The money went into an IOLTA account. Presumably those funds, half of which belonged to Fossum, were used to pay the sales price, "to pay off liens and  obtain releases to clear the title to the property being conveyed." Id., at 98. The record does not explain  exactly how or when the ultimate recipients of those funds received or cashed the checks issued to them by the escrowee, but the parties apparently agree that the deposits generated some interest on principal that was at least in part owned by Hayes during the closing.

In connection with a real estate purchase that closed on May 1, 1997, petitioner Brown made a payment of $ 90,521.29 that remained in escrow for two days, see id., at 53; he estimated that the interest on that deposit amounted to $ 4.96, but he did not claim that he would have received any interest  if the IOLTA Rules had not been in place. 5"Q Are you saying that without IOLTA in place you would have earned $ 4.96 on this transaction?"A Without IOLTA in place I may not have earned anything but it would have been earned in the sense of earning credits for the title company in this case." Id., at 130. The record thus suggests, although the facts are not crystal clear, that funds deposited by each of the petitioners generated some interest that was ultimately paid to the Foundation. It also seems clear that without IOLTA those funds would not have produced any net interest for either of the petitioners.

After discovery, the District Court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. As a factual matter the court concluded "that in no event can the client-depositors make any net returns on the interest accrued in these accounts. Indeed, if the funds were able to make any net return, they would not be subject to the IOLTA program." Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, No. C97-0146C (WD Wash., Jan. 30, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a. As a legal matter, the court concluded that the constitutional issue focused on what an owner has lost, not what the "'taker'" has gained, and that petitioners Hayes and Brown had "lost nothing." Ibid.

 While the case was on appeal, we decided Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U. S. 156, 141 L. Ed. 2d 174, 118 S. Ct. 1925 (1998).Relying on our opinion in that case, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit decided that the IOLTA program caused a taking of petitioners' property and that further proceedings were necessary to determine whether they are entitled to just compensation. The panel concluded: "In sum, we hold that the interest generated by IOLTA pooled trust accounts is property of the clients and customers whose money is deposited into trust, and that a government appropriation of that interest for public purposes is a taking entitling them to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.But just compensation for the takings may be less than the amount  of the interest taken, or nothing, depending on the circumstances, so determining the remedy requires a remand." Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, 236 F.3d 1097, 1115 (2001).

The Court of Appeals then reconsidered the case en banc.271 F.3d 835 (CA9 2001). The en banc majority affirmed the judgment of the District Court, reasoning that, under the ad hoc approach applied in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City,438 U.S. 104, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978), there was no taking because petitioners had suffered neither an actual loss nor an interference with any investment-backed  expectations, and that the regulation of the use of their property was permissible. Moreover, in the majority's view, even if there were a taking, the just compensation due was zero.

The three judges on the original panel, joined by Judge Kozinski, dissented. In their view, the majority's reliance on Penn Central was misplaced because this case involves a "per se" taking rather than a regulatory taking. 271 F.3d at 865-866. The dissenters adhered to the panel's view  that a remand is necessary in order to decide whether any compensation is due.

In their petition for certiorari, Brown and Hayes asked us not only to resolve the disagreement between the majority and the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit about the taking issue, but also to answer a question that none of those judges reached, namely, whether injunctive relief is available because the small amounts to which they claim they are entitled render recovery through litigation impractical. We granted certiorari. 536 U.S. 903, 536 U.S. 903, 153 L. Ed. 2d 178, 122 S. Ct. 2355 (2002).

IIIWhile it confirms the state's authority to confiscate private property, the text of the Fifth Amendment imposes two conditions on the exercise of such authority: the taking must be for a "public use" and "just compensation" must be paid  to the owner. 6Often referred to as the Just Compensation Clause, the final Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides: "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." It applies to the States as well as the Federal Government. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago,166 U.S. 226, 239, 41 L. Ed. 979, 17 S. Ct. 581 (1897). In this case, the first condition is unquestionably satisfied. If the State had imposed a special tax, or perhaps a system of user fees, to generate the funds to finance the legal services supported by the Foundation, there would be no question as to the legiti

 macy of the use of the public's money. 7As the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit observed in their original panel opinion: "IOLTA programs spread rapidly because they were an exceedingly intelligent idea. Money that lawyers deposited in bank trust accounts always produced earnings, but before IOLTA, the clients who owned the money did not receive any of the earnings that their money produced. IOLTA extracted the earnings from the banks and gave it to charities, largely to fund legal services for the poor. That is a very worthy purpose." 236 F.3d 1097, 1115 (2001).In his dissent from the en banc opinion, Judge Kozinski wrote: "It is no doubt true that the IOLTA program serves a salutary purpose, one worthy of our support. As a citizen and former member of the bar, I applaud the state's effort to provide legal services for the poor and disadvantaged." 271 F.3d 835, 867 (CA9 2001). The fact that public funds might pay the legal fees of a lawyer representing a tenant in a dispute with a landlord who was compelled to contribute to the program would not undermine the public character of the "use" of the funds. Provided that she receives just compensation for the taking of her property, a conscientious pacifist has no standing to object to the government's decision to use the property she formerly owned for the production of munitions. Even if there may be occasional misuses of IOLTA funds, the overall, dramatic success of these programs in serving the compelling interest in providing legal services to literally millions of needy Americans certainly qualifies the Foundation's distribution of these funds as a "public use" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. 



 Before moving on to the second  condition, the "just compensation" requirement, we must address the type of taking, if any, that this case involves. As we made clear just last term:

"The text of the Fifth Amendment itself provides a basis for drawing a distinction between physical takings and regulatory takings. Its plain language requires the payment of compensation whenever the government acquires private property for a public purpose, whether the acquisition is the result of a condemnation proceeding or a physical appropriation. But the Constitution contains no comparable reference to regulations that prohibit a property owner from making certain uses of her private property. Our jurisprudence involving condemnations and physical takings is as old as the Republic and, for the most part, involves the straightforward application of per se rules. Our regulatory takings jurisprudence, in contrast, is of  more recent vintage and is characterized by 'essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,' Penn Central, 438 U.S., at 124, designed to allow 'careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.' Palazzolo [v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606, 636, 150 L. Ed. 2d 592, 121 S. Ct. 2448 2001 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).

"When the government physically takes possession of an interest in property for some public purpose, it has a categorical duty to compensate the former owner, United States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 114, 115, 95 L. Ed. 809, 71 S. Ct. 670, 119 Ct. Cl. 851 (1951), regardless of whether the interest that is taken constitutes an entire parcel or merely a part thereof. Thus, compensation is mandated when a leasehold is taken and the government occupies the property for its own purposes, even though that use is temporary. United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 89 L. Ed. 311, 65 S. Ct. 357 (1945), United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 90 L. Ed. 729, 66 S. Ct. 596 (1946). Similarly, when the government appropriates part of a rooftop in order to provide cable TV access for  apartment tenants, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982); or when its planes use private airspace to approach a government airport, United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 90 L. Ed. 1206, 66 S. Ct. 1062, 106 Ct. Cl. 854 (1946), it is required to pay for that share no matter how small. But a government regulation that merely prohibits landlords from evicting tenants unwilling to pay a higher rent, Block v. Hirsh, 256 U.S. 135, 65 L. Ed. 865, 41 S. Ct. 458 (1921); that bans certain private uses of a portion of an owner's property, Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 71 L. Ed. 303, 47 S. Ct. 114, 4 Ohio Law Abs. 816 (1926); Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 94 L. Ed. 2d 472, 107 S. Ct. 1232 (1987); or that forbids the private use of certain airspace, Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, 98 S. Ct. 2646 (1978), does not constitute a categorical taking. 'The first category of cases requires courts to apply a clear rule; the second necessarily entails complex factual assessments of the purposes and economic effects of government actions.' Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 523, 118 L. Ed. 2d 153, 112 S. Ct. 1522 (1992). See also Loretto, 458 U.S., at 440; Keystone, 480 U.S., at 489, n. 18." Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 321-323, 152 L. Ed. 2d 517, 122 S. Ct. 1465 (2002).In their complaint, Brown and Hayes separately challenge (1) the requirement that their funds must be placed in an IOLTA account (Count III) and (2) the later transfers to the Foundation of whatever interest is thereafter earned (Count II). The former is merely a transfer of principal and therefore does not effect a confiscation of any interest. Conceivably it could be viewed as the first step in a "regulatory taking" which should be analyzed under the factors set forth in our opinion in Penn Central. Under such an analysis, however, it is clear that there would be no taking because the transaction had no adverse economic impact on petitioners and did not interfere with any investment-backed expectation. See 438 U.S., at 124.

Even the dissenters in the Court of Appeals did not disagree with the proposition that Penn Centralforecloses the conclusion that there was a regulatory taking effected by the Washington IOLTA program. In their view, however, the proper focus was on the second step, the transfer of interest from the IOLTA account to the Foundation. It was this step that the dissenters likened to the kind of "per se" taking that occurred in Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,458 U.S. 419, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982).

We agree that a per se approach is more consistent with the reasoning in our Phillips opinion than Penn Central's ad hoc analysis.  As was made clear in Phillips, the interest earned in the IOLTA accounts "is the 'private property' of the owner of the principal." 524 U.S., at 172. If this is so, the transfer of the interest to the Foundation here seems more akin to the occupation of a small amount of rooftop space in Loretto.We therefore assume that Brown and Hayes retained the beneficial ownership of at least a portion of their escrow deposits until the funds were disbursed at the closings, that those funds generated some interest in the IOLTA accounts, and that their interest was taken for a public use when it was ultimately turned over to the Foundation. As the dissenters in the Ninth Circuit explained, though, this does not end our inquiry. Instead, we must determine whether any "just compensation" is due.

"The Fifth Amendment does not proscribe the taking of property; it proscribes taking without just compensation." Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172, 194, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126, 105 S. Ct. 3108 (1985). All of the Circuit Judges and District Judges who have confronted the compensation question, both in this case and in Phillips, have agreed that the "just compensation" required by the Fifth Amendment is measured by the property owner's loss  rather than the government's gain. This conclusion is supported by consistent and unambiguous holdings in our cases.

 Most frequently cited is Justice Holmes' characteristically terse statement that "the question is what  has the owner lost, not what has the taker gained." Boston Chamber of Commerce v. Boston, 217 U.S. 189, 195, 54 L. Ed. 725, 30 S. Ct. 459 (1910). Also directly in point is Justice Brandeis' explanation of why a mere technical taking does not give rise to an obligation to pay compensation:

"We have no occasion to determine whether in law the President took possession and assumed control of the Marion & Rye Valley Railway. For even if there was technically a taking, the judgment for defendant was right. Nothing was recoverable as just compensation, because nothing of value was taken from the company; and it was not subjected by the Government to pecuniary loss." Marion & Rye Valley R. Co. v. United States, 270 U.S. 280, 282, 70 L. Ed. 585, 46 S. Ct. 253, 62 Ct. Cl. 756 (1926).

A few years later we again noted that the private party "is entitled to be put in as good a position pecuniarily as if his property had not been taken. He must be made whole but is not entitled to more." Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255, 78 L. Ed. 1236, 54 S. Ct. 704 (1934).

In Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 93 L. Ed. 1765, 69 S. Ct. 1434 (1949), although there was disagreement within the Court concerning the proper measure of the owner's loss when a leasehold interest was condemned, it was common ground that the government should pay "not for what it gets but for what the owner loses." Id., at 23 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Moreover, in his opinion for the majority, Justice Frankfurter made it clear that, given "the liability of all property to condemnation for the common good," an owner's nonpecuniary losses attributable to "his unique need for property or idiosyncratic attachment to it, like loss due to an exercise of  the police power, is properly treated as part of the burden of common citizenship." Id., at 5.Applying the teaching of these cases to the question before us, it is clear that neither Brown nor Hayes is entitled to any compensation for the nonpecuniary consequences of the taking of the interest on his deposited funds, and that any pecuniary compensation must be measured by his net losses rather than the value of the public's gain. For that reason, both the majority 8"We therefore hold that even if the IOLTA program constituted a taking of Brown's and Hayes's private property, there would be no Fifth Amendment violation because the value of their just compensation is nil." 271 F.3d at 864. and the dissenters 9Id., at 883-884. on the Court of Appeals agreed that if petitioners' net loss was zero, the compensation that is due is also zero.

V

Posing hypothetical cases that explain why a lawyer might mistakenly deposit funds in an IOLTA account when those funds might have produced net earnings for the client, the Ninth Circuit dissenters concluded that a remand of this case is necessary to decide whether petitioners are entitled to any compensation.

 "Even though when funds are deposited into IOLTA accounts, the lawyers expect them to earn less than it would cost to distribute the interest, that expectation can turn out to be incorrect, as discussed  above. Several hypothetical cases illustrate the complexities of the remedies, which need further factual development on remand. Suppose $ 2,000 is deposited into a lawyer's trust account paying 5% and stays there for two days. It earns about $ .55, probably well under the cost of a stamp and envelope, along with clerical expenses, needed to send the $ .55 to the client. In that case, the client's financial loss from the taking, if a reasonable charge is  made for the administrative expense, is nothing. The fair market value of a right to receive $ .55 by spending perhaps $ 5.00 to receive it would be nothing. On the other hand, suppose, hypothetically, that the amount deposited into the trust account is $ 30,000, and it stays there for 6 days. The client's loss here would be about $ 29.59 if he does not get the interest, which may well exceed the reasonable administrative expense of paying it to him out of a common fund. It is hard to see how just compensation could be zero in this hypothetical taking, even though it would be in the $ 2,000 for 2 days hypothetical taking. It may be that the difference between what a pooled fund earns, and what the individual clients and escrow companies lose, adds up to enough to sustain a valuable IOLTA program while not depriving any of the clients and customers of just compensation for the takings. This is a practical question entirely undeveloped on this record. We leave it for the parties to consider during the remedial phase of this litigation." 271 F.3d at 883. 10The first hypothetical posed by the Ninth Circuit dissenters illustrates the fundamental flaw in JUSTICE SCALIA's approach to this case. Under his view that just compensation should be measured by the gross amount of the interest taken by the State, the client should recover the $ .55 of interest earned on a two-day deposit even when the transaction costs amount to $ 2.00. Thus, in this case, under JUSTICE SCALIA's approach, even if it is necessary to incur substantial legal and accounting fees to determine how many pennies of interest were earned while petitioners' funds remained in escrow and how much of that interest belonged to them rather than to the sellers, the Constitution would require that they be paid the gross amount of that interest, rather than an amount equal to their net loss (which, of course, is zero). As explained above, this is inconsistent with the Court's just compensation precedents. See supra, at 17-18.Ironically, JUSTICE SCALIA seems to believe that our holding in Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,449 U.S. 155, 66 L. Ed. 2d 358, 101 S. Ct. 446 (1980), would support such a bizarre result. In Webb's, however, the transaction cost that is comparable to the postage in the Ninth Circuit's hypothetical (and to the potential professional fees in this case) is the Clerk's fee of $ 9,228.74, which was deducted from the amount held in the interpleader fund. See id., at 157, 160. The creditors in Webb's recovered an amount equal to their net loss. Indeed, in Webb's we expressly limited our holding to "the narrow circumstances of this case," id. at 164, and reserved decision on the question whether any compensation would have been due if the Clerk had not charged a separate fee. See id., at 164-165.JUSTICE SCALIA is mistaken in stating that we hold that just compensation is measured by the amount of interest "petitioners would have earned had their funds been deposited in non-IOLTA accounts." Post, at 4. We hold (1) that just compensation is measured by the net value of the interest that was actually earned by petitioners and (2) that, by operation of the Washington IOLTA Rules, no net interest can be earned by the money that is placed in IOLTA accounts in Washington. See IOLTA Adoption Order, 102 Wn. 2d 1101, 1114 (1984)("IOLTA funds are only those funds that cannot, under any circumstances, earn net interest (after deducting transaction and administrative costs and bank fees) for the client").

   These hypotheticals persuade us that lawyers and LPOs may occasionally  deposit client funds in an IOLTA account when those funds could have produced net interest for their clients. It does not follow, however, that there is a need for further hearings to determine whether Brown or Hayes is entitled to any compensation from the respondents.

The Rules adopted and administered by the Washington Supreme Court unambiguously require lawyers and LPOs to deposit client funds in non-IOLTA accounts whenever those funds could generate net earnings for the client. See supra, at 8-9. Thus, if the LPOs who deposited petitioners' money in IOLTA accounts could have generated net income, the LPOs violated the court's Rules. Any conceivable net loss to petitioners was the consequence of the LPOs' incorrect private decisions rather than any state action. Such mistakes may well give petitioners a valid claim against the LPOs, but they would provide no support for a claim for compensation from the State, or from any of the respondents. The District Court was therefore entirely correct when it made the factual finding "that in no event can the client-depositors make any net return on the interest accrued in  these accounts. Indeed, if the funds were able to make any net return, they would not be subject to the IOLTA program." Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington, No. C97-0146C (WD Wash., Jan. 30, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. 94a.The categorical requirement in Washington's IOLTA program that mandates the choice of a non-IOLTA account when net interest can be generated for the client provided an independent ground for the en banc court's judgment. It held that the program did "not work a constitutional violation with regard to Brown's and Hayes's property: Even if their property was taken, the Fifth Amendment only protects against a taking without just compensation. Because of the way the IOLTA program operates, the compensation due Brown and Hayes for any taking of their property would be nil. There was therefore no constitutional violation when they were not compensated." 271 F.3d, at 861-862.

We agree with that holding. 11Contrary to the dissent's assertion, this conclusion does not depend on the fact that interest "was created by the beneficence of a state regulatory program." Post, at 1. It rests instead on the fact that just compensation for a net loss of zero is zero.

 VI

To recapitulate: It is neither unethical nor illegal for lawyers to deposit their clients' funds in a single bank account. A state law that requires client funds that could not otherwise generate net earnings for the client to be deposited in an IOLTA account is not a "regulatory taking." A law that requires that the interest on those funds be transferred to a different owner for a legitimate public use, however, could be a per se taking requiring the payment of "just compensation" to the client. Because that compensation is measured by the owner's pecuniary loss -- which is zero whenever the Washington law is obeyed -- there has been no violation of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment in this case. It is therefore unnecessary to discuss the remedial question presented in the certiorari petition. Accordingly, the  judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

Kentucky law provides that "[a] health insurer shall not discriminate against any provider who is located within the geographic coverage area of the health benefit plan and who is willing to meet the terms and conditions for  participation  established by the health insurer, including the Kentucky state Medicaid program and Medicaid partnerships." Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 304.17A-270 (West 2001). Moreover, any "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic  benefits shall . . . permit any licensed chiropractor who agrees to abide by the terms, conditions, reimbursement rates, and standards of quality of the health benefit plan to serve as a participating primary chiropractic provider to any person covered by the plan." § 304.17A-171(2). We granted certiorari to decide whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) pre-empts either, or both, of these "Any Willing Provider" (AWP) statutes.

I

Petitioners include several health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and a Kentucky-based association of HMOs. In order to control the quality and cost of health-care delivery, these HMOs have contracted with selected doctors, hospitals, and other health-care providers to create exclusive "provider networks." Providers in such networks agree to render health-care services to the HMOs' subscribers at discounted rates and to comply with other contractual requirements. In return, they receive the benefit of patient volume higher than that achieved by nonnetwork providers who lack access to petitioners' subscribers.

 Kentucky's AWP statutes impair petitioners' ability to limit the number of providers with access to their networks, and thus their ability to use the assurance of high patient volume as the quid pro quo for the discounted rates that network membership entails. Petitioners believe that AWP laws will frustrate their efforts at cost and quality control, and will ultimately deny consumers the benefit of their cost-reducing arrangements with providers.

In April 1997,  petitioners filed suit against respondent, the Commissioner of Kentucky's Department of Insurance, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, asserting that ERISA, 88 Stat. 832, as amended, pre-empts Kentucky's AWP laws. ERISA pre-empts all state laws "insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan," 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), but state "laws . . . which regulate insurance, banking, or securities" are saved from pre-emption, § 1144(b)(2)(A). The District Court concluded that although both AWP statutes "relate to" employee benefit plans under § 1144(a), each law "regulates insurance" and is therefore saved from pre-emption by § 1144(b)(2)(A). App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a- 84a. In affirming the District Court, the Sixth Circuit also concluded that the AWP laws "regulate insurance" and fall within ERISA's savings clause. Kentucky Ass'n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Nichols, 227 F.3d 352, 363-372 (2000). Relying on UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U.S. 358, 143 L. Ed. 2d 462, 119 S. Ct. 1380 (1999), the Sixth Circuit first held that Kentucky's AWP laws regulate insurance "as a matter of common sense," 227 F.3d at 364, because they are "specifically directed toward 'insurers' and the insurance industry. . . ," id., at 366. The Sixth Circuit then considered, as "checking points or guideposts" in its analysis, the three factors used to determine whether a practice fits within "the business of health insurance" in our cases interpreting the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Id., at 364. These factors are: "first, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral  part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry." Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 129, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647, 102 S. Ct. 3002 (1982). The Sixth Circuit found all three factors satisfied. 227 F.3d at 368-371. Notwithstanding its analysis of the McCarran-Ferguson  factors, the Sixth Circuit reiterated that the "basic test" under ERISA's savings clause is whether, from a common-sense view, the Kentucky AWP laws regulate insurance. Id., at 372. Finding that the laws passed both the "common sense" test and the  McCarran-Ferguson "checking points," the Sixth Circuit upheld Kentucky's AWP statutes. Ibid.

We granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 956, 153 L. Ed. 2d 833, 122 S. Ct. 2657 (2002).

II

To determine whether Kentucky's AWP statutes are saved from preemption, we must ascertain whether they are "laws . . . which regulate insurance" under § 1144(b)(2)(A).

It is well established in our case law that a state law must be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry in order to fall under ERISA's savings clause; laws of general application that have some bearing on insurers do not qualify. Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 50, 95 L. Ed. 2d 39, 107 S. Ct. 1549 (1987); see also Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 366, 153 L. Ed. 2d 375, 122 S. Ct. 2151 (2002); FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 61, 112 L. Ed. 2d 356, 111 S. Ct. 403 (1990). At the same time, not all state laws "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry will be covered by § 1144(b)(2)(A), which saves laws that regulate insurance, not insurers. As we explained in Rush Prudential, insurers must be regulated "with respect to their insurance practices," 536 U.S., at 366. Petitioners contend that Kentucky's AWP laws fall outside the scope of § 1144(b)(2)(A) for two reasons. First, because Kentucky has failed to "specifically direct" its AWP laws towards the insurance industry; and second, because the AWP laws do not regulate an insurance practice. We find neither contention persuasive.

A

Petitioners claim that Kentucky's statutes are not "specifically directed toward" insurers because they regulate not only the insurance industry but also doctors who seek to form and maintain limited provider networks with HMOs. That is to say, the AWP laws equally prevent providers from entering into limited network contracts with insurers, just as they prevent insurers from creating exclusive networks in the first place. We do not think it follows that Kentucky has failed to specifically direct its AWP laws at the insurance industry.

 Neither of Kentucky's AWP statutes, by its terms, imposes any prohibitions or requirements on health-care providers. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 304.17A-270 (West 2001) (imposing obligations only on "health insurers" not to discriminate against any willing provider); § 304.17A-171 (imposing obligations only on "health benefit plans that include chiropractic benefits"). And Kentucky health-care providers are still capable of entering exclusive networks with insurers who conduct  business outside the Commonwealth of Kentucky or who are otherwise not covered by §§ 304.17A-270 or 304.17A-171. Kentucky's statutes are transgressed only when a "health insurer," or a "health benefit plan that includes chiropractic benefits," excludes from its network a provider who is willing and able to meet its terms.It is of course true that as a consequence of Kentucky's AWP laws, entities outside the insurance industry (such as health-care providers) will be unable to enter into certain agreements with Kentucky insurers. But the same could be said about the state laws we held saved from pre-emption in FMC Corp. and Rush Prudential. Pennsylvania's law prohibiting insurers from exercising subrogation rights against an insured's tort recovery, see FMC Corp., supra, at 55, n. 1, also prevented insureds from entering into enforceable contracts with insurers allowing subrogation. Illinois' requirement that HMOs provide independent review of whether services are "medically necessary," Rush Prudential, supra, at 372, likewise excluded insureds from joining an HMO that would have withheld the right to independent review in exchange for a lower premium. Yet neither case found the effects of these laws on noninsurers, significant though they may have been, inconsistent with the requirement that laws saved from pre-emption by § 1144(b)(2)(A) be "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry. Regulations "directed toward" certain entities will almost always disable  other entities from doing, with the regulated entities, what the regulations forbid; this does not suffice to place such regulation outside the scope of ERISA's savings clause. 1Petitioners also contend that Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 304.17A-270 (West 2001) is not "specifically directed toward" insurers because it applies to "self-insurer or multiple employer welfare arrangements not exempt from state regulation by ERISA." § 304.17A-005(23). We do not think § 304.17A-270's application to self-insured non-ERISA plans forfeits its status as a "law . . . which regulates insurance" under 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A). ERISA's savings clause does not require that a state law regulate "insurance companies" or even "the business of insurance" to be saved from pre-emption; it need only be a "law . . . which regulates insurance," ibid. (emphasis added), and self-insured plans engage in the same sort of risk pooling arrangements as separate entities that provide insurance to an employee benefit plan. Any contrary view would render superfluous ERISA's "deemer clause," § 1144(b)(2)(B), which provides that an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA may not "be deemed to be an insurance company or other insurer . . . or to be engaged in the business of insurance . . . for purposes of any law of any State purporting to regulate insurance companies [or] insurance contracts . . ." That clause has effect only on state laws saved from pre-emption by § 1144(b)(2)(A) that would, in the absence of § 1144(b)(2)(B), be allowed to regulate self-insured employee benefit plans. Under petitioners' view, such laws would never be saved from pre-emption in the first place. (The deemer clause presents no obstacle to Kentucky's law, which reaches only those employee benefit plans "not exempt from state regulation by ERISA").Both of Kentucky's AWP laws apply to all HMOs, including HMOs that do not act as insurers but instead provide only administrative services to self-insured plans. Petitioners maintain that the application to noninsuring HMOs forfeits the laws' status as "laws . . . which regulate insurance." § 1144(b)(2)(A). We disagree. To begin with, these noninsuring HMOs would be administering self-insured plans, which we think suffices to bring them within the activity of insurance for purposes of § 1144(b)(2)(A). Moreover, we think petitioners' argument is foreclosed by Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v. Moran, 536 U.S. 355, 372, 153 L. Ed. 2d 375, 122 S. Ct. 2151 (2002), where we noted that Illinois' independent-review laws contained "some overbreadth in the application of [215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125,] § 4-10 [(2000)] beyond orthodox HMOs," yet held that "there is no reason to think Congress would have meant such minimal application to noninsurers to remove a state law entirely from the category of insurance regulation saved from preemption."



 B

Petitioners claim that the AWP laws do not regulate insurers with respect to an insurance practice because, unlike the state laws we held saved from pre-emption in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 85 L. Ed. 2d 728, 105 S. Ct. 2380 (1985), UNUM, and Rush Prudential, they do not control the actual terms of insurance policies. Rather, they focus upon the relationship between an insurer and third-party providers -- which in petitioners' view does not constitute an "insurance practice."

 In support of their contention, petitioners rely on Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 210, 59 L. Ed. 2d 261, 99 S. Ct. 1067 (1979), which held that third-party provider arrangements between insurers and pharmacies were not "the 'business of insurance'" under § 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. 2Section 2 of the McCarran-Ferguson Act provides:"(a) The business of insurance, and every person engaged therein, shall be subject to the laws of the several States which relate to the regulation or taxation of such business."(b) No Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically relates to the business of insurance: Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914, as amended, known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by State law. 59 Stat. 34, 15 U.S.C. § 1012 (emphasis added). ERISA's savings clause, however, is not concerned (as is the McCarran-Ferguson Act provision) with how to characterize conduct undertaken by private actors, but with how to characterize state laws in regard to what they "regulate." It does not follow from Royal Drug that a law mandating certain insurer-provider relationships fails to "regulate insurance. " Suppose a state law required all licensed attorneys to participate in 10 hours of continuing legal education (CLE) each year. This statute "regulates" the practice of law --  even though sitting through 10 hours of CLE classes does not constitute the practice of law -- because the state has conditioned the right to practice law on certain requirements, which substantially affect the product delivered by lawyers to their clients. Kentucky's AWP laws operate in a similar manner with respect to the insurance industry: Those who wish to provide health insurance in Kentucky (any "health insurer") may not discriminate against any willing provider. This "regulates" insurance by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance; whether or not an HMO's contracts with providers constitute "the business of insurance" under Royal Drug is beside the point.

We emphasize that conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance must also substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured to be covered by ERISA's savings clause. Otherwise, any state law aimed at insurance companies  could be deemed a law that "regulates insurance," contrary to our interpretation of § 1144(b)(2)(A) in Rush Prudential, 536 U.S., at 364. A state law requiring all insurance companies to pay their janitors twice the minimum wage would not "regulate insurance," even though it would be a prerequisite to engaging in the business of insurance, because it does not substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement undertaken by insurer and insured. Petitioners contend that Kentucky's AWP statutes fail this test as well, since they do not alter or affect the terms of insurance policies, but concern only the relationship between insureds and third-party providers, Brief for Petitioners 29. We disagree. We have never held that state laws must alter or control the actual terms of insurance policies to be deemed "laws . . . which regulate insurance" under § 1144(b)(2)(A); it suffices that they substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between insurer and insured. By expanding the number of providers from whom an insured may receive health services, AWP laws alter the scope  of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds in a manner similar to the mandated-benefit laws we upheld in Metropolitan Life, the notice-prejudice rule we sustained in UNUM, 3While the Ninth Circuit concluded in Cisneros v. UNUM Life Insurance Co., 134 F.3d 939, 945-946 (1998), aff'd in part, rev'd and remanded in part, UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U.S. 358, 143 L. Ed. 2d 462, 119 S. Ct. 1380 (1999), that "the notice-prejudice rule does not spread the policyholder's risk within the meaning of the first McCarran-Ferguson factor," our test requires only that the state law substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured; it does not require that the state law actually spread risk. See ante, at 8-9. The notice-prejudice rule governs whether or not an insurance company must cover claims submitted late, which dictates to the insurance company the conditions under which it must pay for the risk that it has assumed. This certainly qualifies as a substantial effect on the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured. and the independent-review provisions we approved in  Rush Prudential. No longer may Kentucky insureds seek insurance from a closed network of health-care providers in exchange for a lower premium. The AWP prohibition substantially affects the type of risk pooling arrangements that insurers may offer.



IIIOur prior decisions construing § 1144(b)(2)(A) have relied, to varying degrees, on our cases interpreting §§ 2(a) and 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. In determining whether certain practices constitute "the business of insurance" under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (emphasis added), our cases have looked to three factors: "first, whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; second, whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and third, whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry." Pireno, 458 U.S., at 129.

We believe that our use of the McCarran-Ferguson case law in the ERISA context has misdirected attention, failed  to provide clear guidance to lower federal courts, and, as this case demonstrates, added little to the relevant analysis. That is unsurprising, since the statutory language of § 1144(b)(2)(A) differs  substantially from that of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Rather than concerning itself with whether certain practices constitute "the business of insurance," 15 U.S.C. § 1012(a),  or whether a state law was "enacted . . . for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance," § 1012(b) (emphasis added), 29 U.S.C. § 1144(b)(2)(A) asks merely whether a state law is a "law . . . which regulates insurance, banking, or securities." What is more, the McCarran-Ferguson factors were developed in cases that characterized conduct by private actors, not state laws. See Pireno, supra, at 126 ("The only issue before us is whether petitioners' peer review practices are exempt from antitrust scrutiny as part of the 'business of insurance'" (emphasis added)); Royal Drug, 440 U.S., at 210 ("The only issue before us is whether the Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that these Pharmacy Agreements are not the 'business of insurance' within the meaning of § 2(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act" (emphasis added)).

Our holdings in UNUM and Rush Prudential -- that a state law may fail the first McCarran-Ferguson factor yet still be saved from pre-emption under § 1144(b)(2)(A) -- raise more questions than they answer and provide wide opportunities for divergent outcomes. May a state law satisfy any two of the three McCarran-Ferguson factors and still fall under the savings clause? Just one? What happens if two of three factors are satisfied, but not "securely satisfied" or "clearly satisfied," as they were in UNUM and Rush Prudential? 526 U.S., at 374; 536 U.S., at 373. Further confusion arises from the question whether the state law itself or the conduct regulated by that law is the proper subject to which one applies the McCarran-Ferguson factors. In Pilot Life, we inquired whether Mississippi's law of bad faith has the effect of transferring or spreading risk, 481 U.S., at 50,  whether that law is integral to the insurer-insured relationship, id., at 51, and whether that law is limited to the insurance industry, ibid. 4This approach rendered the third McCarran-Ferguson factor a mere repetition of the prior inquiry into whether a state law is "specifically directed toward" the insurance industry under the "common-sense view." UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U.S. 358, 375, 143 L. Ed. 2d 462, 119 S. Ct. 1380 (1999); Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 50, 95 L. Ed. 2d 39, 107 S. Ct. 1549 (1987).Rush Prudential, by contrast, focused the McCarran-Ferguson inquiry on the conduct regulated by the state law, rather than the state law itself. 536 U.S., at 373 ("It is obvious enough that the independent review requirement regulates 'an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and insured'" (emphasis added)); id., at 374 ("The final factor, that the law be aimed at a 'practice . . . limited to entities within the insurance industry' is satisfied . . ." (emphasis added; citation omitted)).

We have never held that the McCarran-Ferguson factors are an essential component of the § 1144(b)(2)(A) inquiry. Metropolitan  Life initially used these factors only to buttress its previously reached conclusion that Massachusetts' mandated-benefit statute was a "law . . . which regulates insurance" under § 1144(b)(2)(A). 471 U.S., at 742-743. Pilot Life referred to them as mere "considerations [to be] weighed" in determining whether a state law falls under the savings clause. 481 U.S., at 49. UNUM emphasized that the McCarran-Ferguson factors were not "'required'" in the savings clause analysis, and were only "checking points" to be used after determining whether the state law regulates insurance from a "common-sense" understanding. 526 U.S., at 374. And Rush Prudential called the factors "guideposts," using them only to "confirm our conclusion" that Illinois' statute regulated insurance under § 1144(b)(2)(A). 536 U.S., at 373.Today we make a clean break from the McCarran-Ferguson factors and hold that for a state law to be deemed a "law . . . which regulates insurance" under § 1144(b)(2)(A),  it must satisfy two requirements. First, the state law must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance. See Pilot Life, supra, at 50, UNUM, supra, at 368; Rush Prudential, supra, at 366. Second, as explained above, the state law must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured. Kentucky's law satisfies each of these requirements.

 For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

We address once again the measure of punishment, by means of punitive damages, a State may impose upon a defendant in a civil case. The question is whether, in the circumstances we shall recount, an award of $ 145 million in punitive damages, where full compensatory damages are $ 1 million, is excessive and in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

I

In 1981, Curtis Campbell (Campbell) was driving with his wife, Inez Preece Campbell, in Cache County, Utah. He decided to pass six vans traveling ahead of them on a two-lane highway. Todd Ospital was driving a small car approaching from the opposite direction. To avoid a head-on collision with Campbell, who  by then was driving on the wrong side of the highway and toward oncoming traffic, Ospital swerved onto the shoulder, lost control of his automobile, and collided  with a vehicle driven by Robert G. Slusher. Ospital was killed, and Slusher was rendered permanently disabled. The Campbells escaped unscathed.

 In the ensuing wrongful death and tort action, Campbell insisted he was not at fault. Early investigations did support differing conclusions as to who caused the accident, but "a consensus was reached early on by the investigators and witnesses that Mr. Campbell's unsafe pass had indeed caused the crash."2001 UT 89, 65 P.3d 1134, 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, *1 (Utah, Oct. 19, 2001).Campbell's insurance company, petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm), nonetheless decided to contest liability and declined offers by Slusher and Ospital's estate (Ospital) to settle the claims for the policy limit of $ 50,000 ($ 25,000 per claimant). State Farm also ignored the advice of one of its own investigators and took the case to trial, assuring the Campbells that "their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel."  2001 UT 89, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *2. To the contrary, a jury determined that Campbell was 100 percent at fault, and a judgment was returned for $ 185,849, far more than the amount offered in settlement.

At first State Farm refused to cover the $ 135,849 in excess liability. Its counsel made this clear to the Campbells: "'You may want to put for sale signs on your property to get things moving.'" Ibid. Nor was State Farm willing to post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the judgment against him. Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict. During the pendency of the appeal, in late 1984, Slusher, Ospital, and the Campbells reached an agreement whereby Slusher and Ospital agreed not to seek satisfaction of their claims against the Campbells. In exchange the Campbells agreed to pursue a bad faith action against State Farm and to be represented by Slusher's and Ospital's attorneys. The Campbells also agreed that Slusher and Ospital would have a right to play a part in all major decisions concerning the bad faith action. No settlement could be concluded without Slusher's and Ospital's approval, and Slusher and Ospital would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.

In 1989, the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's appeal in the wrongful death and tort actions. Slusher v. Ospital, 777 P.2d 437. State Farm then paid the entire judgment, including the amounts in excess of the policy limits. The Campbells nonetheless filed a complaint against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud,  and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The trial court initially granted State Farm's motion for summary judgment because State Farm had paid the excess verdict, but that ruling was reversed on appeal. 840 P.2d 130 (Utah App. 1992). On remand State Farm moved in limine to exclude evidence of alleged conduct that occurred in unrelated cases outside of Utah, but the trial court denied the motion. At State Farm's request the trial court bifurcated the trial into two phases conducted before different juries. In the first phase the jury determined that  State Farm's decision not to settle was unreasonable because there was a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict.

Before the second phase of the action against State Farm we decided BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore,517 U.S. 559, 134 L. Ed. 2d 809, 116 S. Ct. 1589 (1996), and refused to sustain a $ 2 million punitive damages award which accompanied a verdict of only $ 4,000 in compensatory damages. Based on that decision, State Farm again moved for the exclusion of evidence of dissimilar out-of-state conduct. App. to Pet. for Cert. 168a-172a. The trial court denied State Farm's motion. Id., at 189a.

The second phase addressed State Farm's liability for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. The Utah Supreme Court aptly characterized this phase of the trial:

"State Farm argued during phase II that its decision to take the case to trial was an 'honest mistake' that did  not warrant punitive damages. In contrast, the Campbells introduced evidence that State Farm's decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide. This  scheme was referred to as State Farm's 'Performance, Planning and Review,' or PP & R, policy. To prove the existence of this scheme, the trial court allowed the Campbells to introduce extensive expert testimony regarding fraudulent practices by State Farm in its nation-wide operations. Although State Farm moved prior to phase II of the trial for the exclusion of such evidence and continued to object to it at trial, the trial court ruled that such evidence was admissible to determine whether State Farm's conduct in the Campbell case was indeed intentional and sufficiently egregious to warrant punitive damages." 2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3.

Evidence pertaining to the PP&R policy concerned State Farm's business practices for over 20 years in numerous States. Most of these practices bore no relation to third-party automobile insurance claims, the type of claim underlying the Campbells' complaint against the company. The jury awarded the Campbells $ 2.6 million in compensatory damages and $ 145 million in punitive damages, which the trial court reduced to $ 1 million and $ 25 million respectively. Both parties appealed.

The Utah Supreme Court sought to apply the three guideposts we identified in Gore, supra, at 574-575, and it reinstated the $ 145 million punitive damages award. Relying in large part on the extensive evidence concerning the PP&R policy, the court concluded State Farm's conduct was reprehensible. The court also relied upon State Farm's "massive wealth" and on testimony indicating that "State Farm's actions, because of their clandestine nature, will be punished at most in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability,"  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15, and concluded that the ratio  between punitive and compensatory damages was not unwarranted. Finally, the court noted that the punitive damages award was not excessive when compared to various civil and criminal penalties State Farm could have  faced, including $ 10,000 for each act of fraud, the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah, the disgorgement of profits, and imprisonment.  2001 UT 89, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17. We granted certiorari. 535 U.S. 1111, 535 U.S. 1111, 153 L. Ed. 2d 158, 122 S. Ct. 2326 (2002).

II We recognized in Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.,532 U.S. 424, 149 L. Ed. 2d 674, 121 S. Ct. 1678 (2001), that in our judicial system compensatory and punitive damages, although usually awarded at the same time by the same decisionmaker, serve different purposes. Id., at 432. Compensatory damages "are intended to redress the concrete loss that the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant's wrongful conduct." Ibid. (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 903, pp. 453-454 (1979)). By contrast, punitive damages serve a broader function; they are aimed at deterrence and retribution. Cooper Industries, supra, at 432; see also Gore, supra, at 568 ("Punitive damages may properly be imposed to further a State's legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition"); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip,499 U.S. 1, 19, 113 L. Ed. 2d 1, 111 S. Ct. 1032 (1991) ("Punitive damages are imposed for purposes of retribution and deterrence").

While States possess discretion over the imposition of punitive damages, it is well established that there are procedural and substantive constitutional limitations on these awards. Cooper Industries, supra; Gore, 517 U.S., at 559; Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg,512 U.S. 415, 129 L. Ed. 2d 336, 114 S. Ct. 2331 (1994); TXO Production Corp. v. Alliance Resources Corp.,509 U.S. 443, 125 L. Ed. 2d 366, 113 S. Ct. 2711 (1993); Haslip, supra. 499 U.S. 1 The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of  grossly excessive or arbitrary punishments on a tortfeasor. Cooper Industries, supra, at 433; Gore, 517 U.S., at 562; see also id., at 587 (BREYER, J., concurring) ("This constitutional concern, itself  harkening back to the Magna Carta, arises out of the basic unfairness of depriving citizens of life, liberty, or property, through the application, not of law and legal processes, but of arbitrary coercion"). The reason is that "elementary notions of fairness enshrined in our constitutional jurisprudence dictate that a person receive fair notice not only of the conduct that will subject him to punishment, but also of the severity of the penalty that a State may impose." Id., at 574; Cooper Industries, supra, at 433 ("Despite the broad discretion that States possess with respect to the imposition of criminal penalties and punitive damages, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution imposes substantive limits on that discretion"). To the extent an award is grossly excessive, it furthers no legitimate purpose and constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of property. Haslip, supra, at 42 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) ("Punitive damages are a powerful weapon. Imposed  wisely and with restraint, they have the potential to advance legitimate state interests. Imposed indiscriminately, however, they have a devastating potential for harm. Regrettably, common-law procedures for awarding punitive damages fall into the latter category").

Although these awards serve the same purposes as criminal penalties, defendants subjected to punitive damages in civil cases have not been accorded the protections applicable in a criminal proceeding. This increases our concerns over the imprecise manner in which punitive damages systems are administered. We have admonished that "punitive damages pose an acute danger of arbitrary deprivation of property. Jury instructions typically leave the jury with wide discretion in choosing amounts, and the presentation of evidence of a defendant's net worth creates the potential that juries will use their verdicts to express biases against big businesses, particularly those without strong local presences." Honda Motor, supra, at 432; see also Haslip, supra, at 59 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting) ("The Due Process Clause does not permit a State to classify arbitrariness as a virtue. Indeed, the point of due process -- of the law in general -- is to allow citizens to order their behavior. A State can have no legitimate interest in deliberately making the law so arbitrary that citizens will be unable to avoid punishment based solely upon bias or whim"). Our concerns are heightened when the decisionmaker is presented, as we shall discuss, with evidence that has little bearing as to the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded. Vague instructions, or those that merely inform the jury to avoid "passion or prejudice," App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a-109a, do little to aid the decisionmaker in its task of assigning appropriate weight to evidence that is relevant and evidence that is tangential or only inflammatory. In light of these concerns, in  Gore supra, 517 U.S. 559, we instructed courts reviewing punitive damages to consider three guideposts: (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's misconduct; (2) the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; and (3) the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Id., at 575. We reiterated the importance of these three guideposts in Cooper Industries and mandated appellate courts to conduct de novo review of a trial court's application of them to the jury's award. 532 U.S., at 424. Exacting appellate review ensures that an award of punitive damages is based upon an "'application of law,  rather than a decisionmaker's  caprice.'" Id., at 436 (quoting Gore, supra, at 587 (BREYER, J., concurring)).

IIIUnder the principles outlined inBMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, this case is neither close nor difficult. It was error to reinstate the jury's $ 145 million punitive damages award. We address each guidepost of Gore in some detail. 

 A

 "[T]he most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct." Gore, supra, at 575. We have instructed courts to determine the reprehensibility of a defendant by considering whether: the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others; the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, or mere accident. 517 U.S., at 576-577. The existence of any one of these factors weighing in favor of a plaintiff may not be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any award suspect. It should be presumed a plaintiff has been made whole for his injuries by compensatory damages, so punitive damages should only be awarded if the defendant's culpability, after having paid compensatory damages, is so reprehensible as to warrant the imposition of further sanctions to achieve punishment or deterrence. Id., at 575.

Applying these factors in the instant case, we must acknowledge that State Farm's handling of the claims against the Campbells merits no praise. The trial court found that State Farm's employees altered the company's records to make Campbell appear less culpable. State Farm disregarded the overwhelming likelihood of liability and the near-certain probability that, by taking the case to trial, a judgment in excess of the policy limits would be awarded. State Farm amplified the harm by at first assuring the Campbells their assets would be safe from any verdict and by later telling them, postjudgment, to put a for-sale sign on their house. While we do not suggest there was error in awarding punitive damages based upon State Farm's conduct toward the Campbells, a more modest punishment for this  reprehensible conduct could have satisfied the State's legitimate objectives, and the Utah courts should have gone no further.

This case, instead, was used as a platform to expose, and punish, the perceived deficiencies of State Farm's operations throughout the country. The Utah Supreme Court's opinion makes explicit that State Farm was being condemned for its nationwide policies rather than for the conduct direct toward the Campbells.  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *3 ("The Campbells introduced evidence that State Farm's decision to take the case to trial was a result of a national scheme to meet corporate fiscal goals by capping payouts on claims company wide"). This was, as well, an explicit rationale of the trial court's decision in approving the award, though reduced from $ 145 million to $ 25 million. App. to Pet. for Cert. 120a ("The Campbells demonstrated, through the testimony of State Farm employees who had worked outside of Utah, and through expert testimony, that this pattern of claims adjustment under the PP&R program was not a local anomaly, but was a consistent, nationwide feature of State Farm's business operations, orchestrated  from the highest levels of corporate management").

The Campbells contend that State Farm has only itself to blame for the reliance upon dissimilar and out-of-state conduct evidence. The record does not support  this contention. From their opening statements onward the Campbells framed this case as a chance to rebuke State Farm for its nationwide activities. App. 208 ("You're going to hear evidence that even the insurance commission in Utah and around the country are unwilling or inept at protecting people against abuses"); id., at 242 ("This is a very important case. . . . It transcends the Campbell file. It involves a nationwide practice. And you, here, are going to be evaluating and assessing, and hopefully requiring State Farm to stand accountable for what it's doing across the country, which is the purpose of punitive damages"). This was a position  maintained throughout the litigation. In opposing State Farm's motion to exclude such evidence under Gore, the Campbells' counsel convinced the trial court that there was no limitation on the scope of evidence that could be considered under our precedents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a ("As I read the case [Gore], I was struck with the fact that a clear message in the case . . . seems to be that courts in punitive damages cases should receive more evidence, not less. And that the court seems to be inviting an even broader area of evidence than the current rulings of the court would indicate"); id., at 189a (trial court ruling).A State cannot punish a defendant for conduct that may have been lawful where it occurred. Gore, supra, at 572; Bigelow v. Virginia,421 U.S. 809, 824, 44 L. Ed. 2d 600, 95 S. Ct. 2222 (1975) ("A State does not acquire power or supervision over the internal affairs of another State merely because the welfare and health of its own citizens may be affected when they travel to that State"); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Head,234 U.S. 149, 161, 58 L. Ed. 1259, 34 S. Ct. 879 (1914) ("It would be impossible to permit the statutes of Missouri to operate beyond the jurisdiction of that State . . . without throwing down the constitutional barriers by which all the States are restricted within the orbits of their lawful authority and upon the preservation of which the Government under the Constitution depends. This is so obviously the necessary result of the Constitution that it has rarely been called in question and hence authorities directly dealing with it do not abound"); Huntington v. Attrill,146 U.S. 657, 669, 36 L. Ed. 1123, 13 S. Ct. 224 (1892) ("Laws have no force of themselves beyond the jurisdiction of the State which enacts them, and can have extra-territorial effect only by the comity of other States"). Nor, as a general rule, does a State have a legitimate concern in imposing punitive damages to punish a defendant for unlawful acts committed outside of the State's jurisdiction. Any proper adjudication of conduct that occurred outside Utah to other persons would require their inclusion, and, to those parties, the Utah courts, in the usual case, would need  to apply the laws of their relevant jurisdiction. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,472 U.S. 797, 821-822, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985).Here, the Campbells do not dispute that much of the out-of-state conduct was lawful where it  occurred. They argue, however, that such evidence was not the primary basis for the punitive damages award and was relevant to the extent it demonstrated, in a general sense, State Farm's motive against its insured. Brief for Respondents 46-47 ("Even if the practices described by State Farm were not malum in se or malum prohibitum, they became relevant to punitive damages to the extent they were used as tools to implement State Farm's wrongful PP&R policy"). This argument misses the mark. Lawful out-of-state conduct may be probative when it demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability of the defendant's action in the State where it is tortious, but that conduct must have a nexus to the specific harm suffered by the plaintiff. A jury must be instructed, furthermore, that it may not use evidence of out-of-state conduct to punish a defendant for action that was lawful in the jurisdiction  where it occurred. Gore, 517 U.S., at 572-573 (noting that a State "does not have the power . . . to punish [a defendant] for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and that had no impact on [the State] or its residents"). A basic principle of federalism is that each State may make its own reasoned judgment about what conduct is permitted or proscribed within its borders, and each State alone can determine what measure of punishment, if any, to impose on a defendant who acts within its jurisdiction. Id., at 569 ("The States need not, and in fact do not, provide such protection in a uniform manner").For a more fundamental reason, however, the Utah courts erred in relying upon this and other evidence: The courts awarded punitive damages to punish and deter conduct that bore no relation to the Campbells' harm. A defendant's dissimilar acts, independent from the acts upon which liability was premised, may not serve as the basis for punitive damages.  A defendant should be punished for the conduct that harmed the plaintiff, not for being an unsavory individual or business. Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties' hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis, but we have no doubt the Utah Supreme Court did that here.  2001 UT 89, __ P. 3d, at __, 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *11 ("Even if the harm to the Campbells can be appropriately characterized as minimal, the trial court's assessment of the situation is on target: 'The harm is minor to the individual but massive in the aggregate'"). Punishment on these bases creates the possibility of multiple punitive damages awards for the same conduct; for in the usual case nonparties are not bound by the judgment some other plaintiff obtains. Gore, supra, at 593 (BREYER, J., concurring) ("Larger damages might also 'double count' by including in the punitive damages award some of the compensatory, or punitive, damages that subsequent plaintiffs would also recover").The same reasons lead us to conclude the Utah Supreme Court's decision cannot be justified on the grounds that State Farm was a recidivist. Although "our holdings that a recidivist may be punished more severely than a first offender recognize that repeated misconduct  is more reprehensible than an individual instance of malfeasance," Gore, supra, at 577, in the context of civil actions courts must ensure the conduct in question replicates the prior transgressions. TXO, 509 U.S., at 462, n. 28 (noting that courts should look to "'the existence and frequency of similar past conduct'") (quoting Haslip, 499 U.S., at 21- 2).

The Campbells have identified scant evidence of repeated misconduct of the sort that injured them. Nor does our review of the Utah courts' decisions convince us that State Farm was only punished for its actions toward the Campbells. Although evidence of other acts need not be identical to have relevance in the calculation of punitive damages, the Utah court erred here because evidence pertaining to claims that had nothing to do with a third-party lawsuit was introduced at length. Other evidence concerning reprehensibility was even more tangential. For example, the Utah Supreme Court criticized State Farm's investigation into the personal life of one of its employees and, in a broader approach, the manner in which State Farm's policies corrupted its employees.  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *10;  2001 UT 89, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12. The Campbells attempt to justify the courts' reliance upon this unrelated testimony on the theory that each dollar of profit made by underpaying a third-party claimant is the same as a dollar made by underpaying a first-party one. Brief for Respondents 45; see also  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *12 ("State Farm's continuing illicit practice created market disadvantages for other honest insurance companies because these practices increased profits. As plaintiffs' expert witnesses established, such wrongfully obtained competitive advantages have the potential to pressure other companies to adopt similar fraudulent tactics, or to force them out of business. Thus, such actions cause distortions throughout the insurance market and ultimately hurt all consumers"). For the reasons already stated, this argument is unconvincing. The reprehensibility guidepost does not permit courts to expand the scope of the case so that a defendant may be punished for any malfeasance, which in this case extended for a 20-year period. In this case, because the Campbells have shown no conduct by State Farm similar to that which harmed them, the conduct that harmed them is the only conduct relevant to the reprehensibility analysis.

BTurning to the secondGore guidepost, we have been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award. Gore, supra, at 582 ("We have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual and potential damages to the punitive award"); TXO, supra, at 458. We decline again to impose a bright-line ratio which a punitive damages award cannot exceed. Our jurisprudence and the principles it has now established demonstrate, however, that, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio  between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process. In Haslip, in upholding a punitive damages award, we concluded that an award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of constitutional impropriety. 499 U.S., at 23-24. We cited that 4-to-1 ratio again in Gore. 517 U.S., at 581. The Court further referenced a long legislative history, dating back over 700 years and going forward to today, providing for sanctions of double, treble, or quadruple damages to deter and punish. Id., at 581, and n. 33. While these ratios are not binding, they are instructive. They demonstrate what should be obvious: Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State's goals of deterrence and retribution, than awards with ratios in range of 500 to 1, id., at 582, or, in this case, of 145 to 1.

Nonetheless, because there are no rigid benchmarks that a punitive damages award may not surpass, ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where "a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages." Ibid.; see also ibid. (positing that a higher ratio might be necessary where "the injury is hard to detect or the monetary value of noneconomic harm might have been difficult to determine"). The converse is also true, however. When compensatory damages are substantial, then a lesser ratio, perhaps only equal to compensatory damages, can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee. The precise award in any case, of course, must be based upon the facts and circumstances of the defendant's conduct and the harm to the plaintiff. 



In sum, courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered. In the context of this case, we have no doubt that there is a presumption against an award that has a 145-to-1 ratio. The compensatory award in this case was substantial; the Campbells were awarded $ 1 million for a year and a half of emotional distress.  This was complete compensation. The harm arose from a transaction in the economic realm, not from some physical assault or trauma; there were no physical injuries; and State Farm paid the excess verdict before the complaint was filed, so the Campbells suffered only minor economic injuries for the 18-month period in which State Farm refused to resolve the claim against them. The compensatory damages for the injury suffered here, moreover, likely were based on a component which was duplicated in the punitive award. Much of the distress was caused by the outrage and humiliation the Campbells suffered at the actions of their insurer; and it is a major role of punitive damages to condemn such conduct. Compensatory damages, however, already contain this punitive element. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908, Comment c, p. 466 (1977) ("In many cases in which compensatory damages include an amount for emotional distress, such as humiliation or indignation aroused by the defendant's act, there is no clear line of  demarcation between punishment and compensation and a verdict for a specified amount frequently includes elements of both").The Utah Supreme Court sought to justify the massive award by pointing to State Farm's purported failure to report a prior $ 100 million punitive damages award in Texas to its corporate headquarters; the fact that State Farm's policies have affected numerous Utah consumers; the fact that State Farm will only be punished in one out of every 50,000 cases as a matter of statistical probability; and State Farm's enormous wealth.  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *15. Since the Supreme  Court of Utah discussed the Texas award when applying the ratio guidepost, we discuss it here. The Texas award, however, should have been analyzed in the context of the reprehensibility guidepost only. The failure of the company to report the Texas award is out-of-state conduct that, if the conduct were similar, might have had some bearing on the degree of reprehensibility, subject to the limitations we have described. Here, it was dissimilar, and of such marginal relevance that it should have been accorded little or no weight. The award was rendered in a first-party lawsuit; no judgment was entered in the case; and it was later settled for a fraction of the verdict. With respect to the Utah Supreme Court's second justification, the Campbells'  inability to direct us to testimony demonstrating harm to the people of Utah (other than those directly involved in this case) indicates that the adverse effect on the State's general population was in fact minor.

The remaining premises for the Utah Supreme Court's decision bear no relation to the award's reasonableness or proportionality to the harm. They are, rather, arguments that seek to defend a departure from well-established constraints on punitive damages. While States enjoy considerable discretion in deducing when punitive damages are warranted, each award must comport with the principles set forth in Gore. Here the argument that State Farm will be punished in only the rare case, coupled with reference to its assets (which, of course, are what other insured parties in Utah and other States must rely upon for payment of claims) had little to do with the actual harm sustained by the Campbells. The wealth of a defendant cannot justify an otherwise unconstitutional punitive damages award. Gore, 517 U.S., at 585 ("The fact that BMW is a large corporation rather than an impecunious individual does not diminish its entitlement to fair notice of the demands that the several States impose on the conduct of its business"); see also id., at 591 (BREYER, J., concurring) ("[Wealth] provides an open-ended basis for  inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy . . . . That does not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such as 'reprehensibility,' to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendant's conduct"). The principles set forth in Gore  must be implemented with care, to ensure both reasonableness and proportionality.

CThe third guidepost inGore is the disparity between the punitive  damages award and the "civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases." Id., at 575. We note that, in the past, we have also looked to criminal penalties that could be imposed. Id., at 583; Haslip, 499 U.S., at 23. The existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing on the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action. When used to determine the dollar amount of the award, however, the criminal penalty has less utility. Great care must be taken to avoid use of the civil process to assess criminal penalties that can be imposed only after the heightened protections of a criminal trial have been observed, including, of course, its higher standards of proof. Punitive damages are not a substitute for the criminal process, and the remote possibility of a criminal sanction does not automatically sustain a punitive damages award.

Here, we need not dwell long on this guidepost. The most relevant civil sanction under Utah state law for the wrong done to the Campbells appears to be a $ 10,000 fine for an act of fraud,  2001 UT 89,     P. 3d, at    , 2001 Utah LEXIS 170, 2001 WL 1246676, at *17, an amount dwarfed by the $ 145 million punitive damages award. The Supreme Court of Utah speculated about the loss of State Farm's business license, the disgorgement of profits, and possible imprisonment, but here again its references were to the broad fraudulent scheme drawn from evidence of out-of-state and dissimilar conduct. This analysis was insufficient to justify the award. 

IVAn application of theGore guideposts to the facts of this case, especially in light of the substantial compensatory damages awarded (a portion of which contained a punitive element), likely would justify a punitive damages award at or near the amount of compensatory damages. The punitive award of $ 145 million, therefore, was neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed, and it was an irrational and arbitrary deprivation of the property of the defendant. The proper calculation of punitive damages under the principles we have discussed should be resolved, in the first instance, by the Utah courts.

 The judgment of the Utah Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.  


JUSTICE SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case, we are asked to decide whether respondents can be compelled to arbitrate claims arising under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., notwithstanding the fact that the parties' arbitration agreements may be construed to limit the arbitrator's authority to award damages under that statute.

I

Respondents are members of a group of physicians who filed suit against managed-health-care organizations including petitioners PacifiCare Health Systems, Inc., and PacifiCare Operations, Inc. (collectively, PacifiCare), and UnitedHealthcare, Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (collectively, United). These physicians alleged that the defendants unlawfully failed to reimburse them for health-care services that they had provided to patients covered by defendants' health plans. They brought causes of action under RICO, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and federal and state prompt-pay statutes, as well as claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and in quantum meruit. In re Managed Care Litig., 132 F. Supp. 2d 989, 992 (S D Fla. 2000).

 Of particular concern here, PacifiCare and United moved the District Court to compel arbitration, arguing that provisions in their contracts with respondents required arbitration of these disputes, including those arising under RICO. Ibid. Respondents opposed the motion on the  ground that, because the arbitration provisions prohibit an award of punitive damages, see App. 107, 147, 168, 212, respondents could not obtain "meaningful relief" in arbitration for their claims under the RICO statute, which authorizes treble damages, 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). See Paladino v. Avnet Computer Technologies, Inc., 134 F.3d 1054, 1062 (CA11 1998) (holding that where a remedial limitation in an arbitration agreement prevents a plaintiff from obtaining "meaningful relief" for a statutory claim, the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable with respect to that claim).

The District Court denied petitioners' request to compel arbitration of the RICO claims. 132 F. Supp. 2d, at 1007. The court concluded that given the remedial limitations in the relevant contracts, it was, indeed, "faced with a potential Paladino situation . . ., where the plaintiff may not be able to obtain meaningful relief for allegations of statutory violations in an arbitration forum." Id., 132 F. Supp. 2d at 1005. Accordingly, it found the arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to respondents' RICO claims. Id., 132 F. Supp. 2d at 1007. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed "for the reasons set forth in [the District Court's] comprehensive opinion," Price Plaintiffs v. Humana Ins. Co. (In re Humana Inc. Managed Care Litig.), 285 F.3d 971, 973 (2002), and we granted certiorari, 537 U.S. 946, 537 U.S. 946, 154 L. Ed. 2d 289, 123 S. Ct. 409 (2002).

II

Petitioners argue that whether the remedial limitations render their arbitration agreements unenforceable is not a question of "arbitrability," and hence should have been decided by an arbitrator, rather than a court, in the first instance. They also claim that even if this question is one of arbitrability, and is therefore properly within the purview of the courts at this time, the remedial limitations at issue do not require invalidation of their arbitration agreements. Either way, petitioners contend, the lower courts should have compelled arbitration. We conclude that it would be premature for us to address these questions at this time.

 Our decision in Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer,515 U.S. 528, 132 L. Ed. 2d 462, 115 S. Ct. 2322 (1995), supplies the analytic framework for assessing the ripeness of this dispute. In Vimar, we dealt with a bill of lading concerning a shipment of goods from Morocco to Massachusetts. Upon receipt of the goods, the purchaser discovered that they had been damaged, and, along with its insurer (Vimar), filed suit against the shipper. The shipper sought to compel arbitration, relying on choice-of-law and arbitration clauses in the bill of lading under which disputes arising out of the parties' agreement were to be governed by Japanese law and resolved through arbitration before the Tokyo Maritime Arbitration Commission. Vimar countered by arguing that the arbitration clause violated the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U.S.C. App. § 1300 et seq., and hence was unenforceable. 515 U.S., at 531-532. In particular, Vimar claimed that "there is no guarantee foreign arbitrators will apply COGSA"; that the foreign arbitrator was likely to apply rules of Japanese law under which respondents' liability might be less than what it would be under COGSA; and that this would violate "the central  guarantee of [COGSA] § 3(8) . . . that the terms of a bill of lading may not relieve the carrier of obligations or diminish the legal duties specified by the Act." Id.,515 U.S. at 539.

Notwithstanding Vimar's insistence that the arbitration agreement violated federal policy as embodied in COGSA, we declined to reach the issue and held that the arbitration clause was, at least initially, enforceable. "At this interlocutory stage," we explained, "it is not established what law the arbitrators will apply to petitioner's claims or that petitioner will receive diminished protection as a result. The arbitrators may conclude that COGSA applies of its own force or that Japanese law does not apply so that, under another clause of the bill of lading, COGSA controls." Id., 515 U.S. at 540. We further emphasized that "mere speculation that the foreign arbitrators might apply Japanese law which, depending on the proper construction of COGSA, might reduce respondents' legal obligations, does not in and of itself lessen liability under COGSA § 3(8)[,]" nor did it provide an adequate basis upon which to declare the relevant arbitration agreement unenforceable. Id., 515 U.S. at 541 (emphases added). We found that "whatever the merits of petitioner's comparative reading of COGSA and its Japanese counterpart, its claim is premature." Id.,515 U.S. at 540.

The case at bar arrives in a similar posture. Two of the four arbitration agreements at issue provide that "punitive damages shall not be awarded [in arbitration]," App. 107, 147; one provides that "the arbitrators . . . shall have no authority to award any punitive or exemplary damages, id., at 212; and one provides that "the arbitrators . . . shall have no authority to award extra contractual damages of any kind, including punitive or exemplary damages . . . ," id., at 168. Respondents insist, and the District Court agreed,  132 F. Supp. 2d, at 1000-1001, 1005, that these provisions preclude an arbitrator from awarding treble damages under RICO. We think that neither our precedents nor the ambiguous terms of the contracts make this clear.

Our cases have placed different statutory treble-damages provisions on different points along the spectrum between purely compensatory and strictly punitive awards. Thus, in Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 784, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858 (2000), we characterized the treble-damages provision of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733, as "essentially punitive in nature." In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc.,429 U.S. 477, 485, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), on the other hand, we explained that the treble-damages provision of § 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, "is in essence a remedial provision." Likewise in American Soc. of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp.,456 U.S. 556, 575, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982), we noted that "the antitrust private action [which allows for treble damages] was created primarily as a remedy for the victims of antitrust violations," (emphasis added). And earlier this Term, in  Cook County v. United States ex rel. Chandler, 538 U.S. 119, 155 L. Ed.  2d 247, 123 S. Ct. 1239 (2003) (Slip op., at 9), we stated that "it is important to realize that treble damages have a compensatory side, serving remedial purposes in addition to punitive objectives. " Indeed, we have repeatedly acknowledged that the treble-damages provision contained in RICO itself is remedial in nature. In Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc.,483 U.S. 143, 151, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct. 2759 (1987), we stated that "both RICO and the Clayton Act are designed to remedy economic injury by providing for the recovery of treble damages, costs, and attorney's fees," (emphasis added). And in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon,482 U.S. 220, 241, 96 L. Ed. 2d 185, 107 S. Ct. 2332 (1987) we took note of the "remedial function" of RICO's treble-damages provision.

In light of our case law's treatment of statutory treble damages, and given the uncertainty surrounding the parties' intent with respect to the contractual term "punitive," 1Contrary to respondents' contention, the prohibition in Dr. Manual Porth's contract against an arbitrator's awarding "extracontractual" damages is likewise ambiguous. This language might mean, as respon-dents would have it, that an arbitrator is prohibited from awarding any damages other than for breach of contract. Brief for Respondents 20- 21. But it might only mean that an arbitrator cannot award non-economic damages such as punitive or mental-anguish damages. See 3 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies: Damages-Equity-Restitution § 12.1(1), p. 8 (2d ed. 1993) ("Punitive damages and mental anguish damages are thus considered 'extracontractual,' and usually denied in pure contract cases"). the application of the disputed language to respondents' RICO claims is, to say the least, in doubt. AndVimar instructs that we should not, on the basis of "mere speculation" that an arbitrator might interpret these ambiguous agreements in a manner that casts their enforceability into doubt, take upon ourselves the authority to decide the antecedent question of how the ambiguity is to be  resolved. 2If the contractual ambiguity could itself be characterized as raising a "gateway" question of arbitrability, then it would be appropriate for a court to answer it in the first instance. But we noted just this Term that "the phrase 'question of arbitrability' has a . . . limited scope." Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,537 U.S.    , 537 U.S. 79, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491, 123 S. Ct. 588 (2002) (Slip op. at 4). Indeed, we have "found the phrase [question of arbitrability] applicable in the kind of narrow circumstance where contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided the gateway matter, where they are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would do so, and, consequently, where reference of the gateway dispute to the court avoids the risk of forcing parties to arbitrate a matter that they may well not have agreed to arbitrate." Ibid. Given our presumption in favor of arbitration, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 74 L. Ed. 2d 765, 103 S. Ct. 927 (1983), we think the preliminary question whether the remedial limitations at issue here prohibit an award of RICO treble damages is not a question of arbitrability.515 U.S., at 541.In short, since we do not know how the arbitrator will construe the remedial limitations, the questions whether they render the parties' agreements unenforceable and whether it is for courts or arbitrators to decide enforceability in the first instance are unusually abstract. As in Vimar, the proper course is to compel arbitration. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 It is so ordered.

JUSTICE THOMAS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.  


JUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.

Foreign states may invoke certain rights and immunities in litigation under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of  1976 (FSIA or Act), Pub. L. 94-583, 90 Stat. 2891. Some of the Act's provisions also may be invoked by a corporate entity that is an "instrumentality" of a foreign state as defined by the Act. Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 611, 119 L. Ed. 2d 394, 112 S. Ct. 2160 (1992); Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 488, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81, 103 S. Ct. 1962 (1983). The corporate entities in this action claim instrumentality status to invoke the Act's provisions allowing removal of state-court actions to federal court. As the action comes to us, it presents two questions. The first is whether a corporate subsidiary can claim instrumentality status where the foreign state does not own a majority of its shares but does own a majority of the shares of a corporate parent one or more tiers above the subsidiary. The second question is whether a corporation's instrumentality status is defined as of the time an alleged tort or other actionable wrong occurred or, on the other hand, at the time suit is filed. We granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 956 (2002).

I

The underlying action was filed in a state court in Hawaii in 1997 against Dole Food Company and other companies (Dole petitioners). Plaintiffs in the action were a group of farm workers from Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Panama who alleged injury from exposure to dibromochloropropane, a chemical used as an agricultural pesticide in their home countries. The Dole petitioners impleaded petitioners Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd., and Bromine Compounds, Ltd. (collectively, the Dead Sea Companies). The merits of the suit are not before us.

 The Dole petitioners removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), arguing that the federal common law of foreign relations provided federal-question jurisdiction under § 1331. The District Court agreed there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the federal common law of  foreign relations but, nevertheless, dismissed the case on grounds of forum non conveniens.

The Dead Sea Companies removed under a separate theory. They claimed to be instrumentalities of a foreign state as defined by the FSIA, entitling them to removal under § 1441(d). The District Court held that the Dead Sea Companies are not instrumentalities of a foreign state for purposes of the FSIA and are not entitled to removal on that basis. Civ. No. 97-01516HG (D. Haw., Sept. 9, 1998), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 01-594, p. 79a.

The Court of Appeals reversed. Addressing the ground relied on by the  Dole petitioners, it held removal could not rest on the federal common law of foreign relations. 251 F.3d 795, 800 (CA9 2001). In this Court the Dole petitioners did not seek review of that portion of the Court of Appeals' ruling, and we do not address it. Accordingly, the writ of certiorari in No. 01-593 is dismissed.

The Court of Appeals also reversed the order allowing removal at the instance of the Dead Sea Companies, who alleged they were instrumentalities of the State of Israel. The Court of Appeals noted, but declined to answer, the question whether status as an instrumentality of a foreign state is assessed at the time of the alleged wrongdoing or at the time suit is filed. It went on to hold that the Dead Sea Companies, even at the earlier date, were not instrumentalities of Israel because they did not meet the Act's definition of instrumentality.

In order to prevail here, the Dead Sea Companies must show both that instrumentality status is determined as of the time the alleged tort occurred and that they can claim instrumentality status even though they were but subsidiaries of a parent owned by the State of Israel. We address each question in turn. In No. 01-594, the case in which the Dead Sea Companies are petitioners, we now affirm. 

 II

A

Title 28 U.S.C. § 1441(d) governs removal of actions against foreign states. It provides that "any civil action brought in a State court against a foreign state as defined in [28 U.S.C. § 1603(a)] may be removed by the foreign state to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending." See also 28 U.S.C. § 1330 (governing original jurisdiction). Section 1603(a), part of the FSIA, defines "foreign state" to include an "agency or instrumentality of a foreign state." "Agency or instrumentality of a foreign state" is defined, in turn, as:

"Any entity --

"(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and

"(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and

"(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States . . . nor created under the laws of any third country." § 1603(b).

B

The Court of Appeals resolved the question of the FSIA's applicability by holding that a subsidiary of an instrumentality is not itself entitled to instrumentality status. Its holding was correct. 

  The State of Israel did not have direct ownership of shares in either of the Dead Sea Companies at any time pertinent to this suit. Rather, these companies were, at various times, separated from the State of Israel by one or more intermediate corporate tiers. For example, from 1984-1985, Israel wholly owned a company called Israeli Chemicals, Ltd.; which owned  a majority of shares in another company called Dead Sea Works, Ltd.; which owned a majority of shares in Dead Sea Bromine Co., Ltd.; which owned a majority of shares in Bromine Compounds, Ltd.

The Dead Sea Companies, as indirect subsidiaries of the State of Israel, were not instrumentalities of Israel under the FSIA at any time. Those companies cannot come within the statutory language which grants status as an instrumentality of a foreign state to an entity a "majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof." § 1603(b)(2). We hold that only direct ownership of a majority of shares by the foreign state satisfies the statutory requirement.

Section 1603(b)(2) speaks of ownership. The Dead Sea Companies urge us to ignore corporate formalities and use the colloquial sense of that term. They ask whether, in common parlance, Israel would be said to own the Dead Sea Companies. We reject this analysis. In issues of corporate law structure often matters. It is evident from the Act's text that Congress was aware of settled principles of corporate law and legislated within that context. The language of § 1603(b)(2) refers to ownership of "shares," showing that Congress intended statutory coverage to turn on formal corporate ownership. Likewise, § 1603(b)(1), another component of the definition of instrumentality, refers to a "separate legal person, corporate or otherwise." In light of these indicia that Congress had corporate formalities in mind, we assess whether Israel owned shares in the Dead Sea Companies as a matter of corporate law, irrespective of whether Israel could be said to have owned the Dead Sea Companies in everyday parlance.A basic tenet of American corporate law is that the corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities. See, e.g.,First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611, 625, 77 L. Ed. 2d 46, 103 S. Ct. 2591 (1983) ("Separate legal personality has been described as 'an almost indispensable aspect of the public corporation'"); Burnet v. Clark, 287 U.S. 410, 415, 77 L. Ed. 397, 53 S. Ct. 207, 1933-1 C.B. 175(1932) ("A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be treated as separate entities"). An individual shareholder, by virtue of his ownership of shares, does not own the corporation's assets and, as a result, does not own subsidiary corporations in which the corporation holds an interest. See 1 Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 31 (rev. ed. 1999). A corporate parent which owns the shares of a subsidiary does not, for that reason alone, own or have legal title to the assets of the subsidiary; and, it follows with even greater force, the parent does not own or have legal title to the subsidiaries of the subsidiary. See id.,§ 31, at 514 ("The properties of two corporations are distinct, though the same shareholders own or control both. A holding corporation does not own the subsidiary's property"). The fact that the shareholder is a foreign state does not change the analysis. See First Nat. City Bank, supra, at 626-627 ("Government instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such").Applying these principles, it follows that Israel did not own a majority of shares in the Dead Sea Companies. The State of Israel owned a  majority of shares, at various times, in companies one or more corporate tiers above the Dead Sea Companies, but at no time did Israel own a majority of shares in the Dead Sea Companies.  Those companies were subsidiaries of other corporations.The veil separating corporations and their shareholders may be pierced in some circumstances, and the Dead Sea Companies essentially urge us to interpret the FSIA as piercing the veil in all cases. The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, however, is the rare exception, applied in the case of fraud or certain other exceptional circumstances, see, e.g., Burnet, supra, at 415; 1 Fletcher, supra, §§ 41 to 41.20, and usually determined on a case-by-case basis. The Dead Sea Companies have referred us to no authority for extending the doctrine so far that, as a categorical matter, all subsidiaries  are deemed to be the same as the parent corporation. The text of the FSIA gives no indication that Congress intended us to depart from the general rules regarding corporate formalities.

Where Congress intends to refer to ownership in other than the formal sense, it knows how to do so. Various federal statutes refer to "direct and indirect ownership." See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. § 8477 (a)(4)(G)(iii) (referring to an interest "owned directly or indirectly"); 12 U.S.C. § 84(c)(5) (referring to "any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States"); 15 U.S.C. § 79b(a)(8)(A) (referring to securities "which are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote"); § 1802(3) (" The term 'newspaper owner' means any person who owns or controls directly, or indirectly through separate or subsidiary corporations, one or more newspaper publications"). The absence of this language in 28 U.S.C. § 1603(b) instructs us that Congress did not intend to disregard structural ownership rules.

The FSIA's definition of instrumentality refers to a foreign state's majority ownership of "shares or other ownership interest." § 1603(b)(2). The Dead Sea Companies would have us read "other ownership interest" to include a state's "interest" in its instrumentality's subsidiary. The better reading of the text, in our view, does not support this argument. The words "other ownership interest," when following the word "shares," should be interpreted to refer to a type of interest other than ownership of stock. The statute had to be written for the contingency of ownership forms in other countries, or even in this country, that depart from conventional corporate structures. The statutory phrase "other ownership interest" is best understood to accomplish this objective. Reading the term to refer to a state's interest in entities lower on the corporate ladder would make the specific reference to "shares" redundant. Absent a statutory text or structure that requires us to depart from normal rules of construction, we should not construe the statute in  a manner that is strained and, at the same time, would render a statutory term superfluous. See Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, 508 U.S. 248, 258, 124 L. Ed. 2d 161, 113 S. Ct. 2063 (1993) ("We will not read the statute to render the modifier superfluous"); United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 36, 117 L. Ed. 2d 181, 112 S. Ct. 1011 (1992) (declining  to adopt a construction that would violate the "settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect").The Dead Sea Companies say that the State of Israel exercised considerable control over the their operations, notwithstanding Israel's indirect relationship to those companies. They appear to think that, in determining instrumentality status under the Act, control may be substituted for an ownership interest. Control and ownership, however, are distinct concepts. See, e.g., United States v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 64-65, 141 L. Ed. 2d 43, 118 S. Ct. 1876 (1998) (distinguishing between "operation" and "ownership" of a subsidiary's assets for purposes of Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 liability). The terms of § 1603(b)(2) are explicit and straightforward.  Majority ownership by a foreign state, not control, is the benchmark of instrumentality status. We need not delve into Israeli law or examine the extent of Israel's involvement in the Dead Sea Companies' operations. Even if Israel exerted the control the Dead Sea Companies describe, that would not give Israel a "majority of [the companies'] shares or other ownership interest." The statutory language will not support a control test that mandates inquiry in every case into the past details of a foreign nation's relation to a corporate entity in which it does not own a majority of the shares.

The better rule is the one supported by the statutory text and elementary principles of corporate law. A corporation is an instrumentality of a foreign state under the FSIA only if the foreign state itself owns a majority of the corporation's shares.

 We now turn to the second question before us, which provides an alternative reason for affirming the Court of Appeals. See Woods v. Interstate Realty Co.,337 U.S. 535, 537, 93 L. Ed. 1524, 69 S. Ct. 1235 (1949).

To be entitled to removal under § 1441(d), the Dead Sea Companies must show that they are entities "a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state." § 1603(b)(2). We think the plain text of this provision, because it is expressed in the present tense, requires that instrumentality status be determined at the time suit is filed.

Construing § 1603(b) so that the present tense has real significance is consistent with the "longstanding principle that 'the jurisdiction of the Court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.'" Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 207, 124 L. Ed. 2d 118, 113 S. Ct. 2035 (1993) (quoting  Mollan v. Torrance, 22 U.S. 537, 9 Wheat. 537, 539, 6 L. Ed. 154 (1824)). It is well settled, for example, that federal-diversity jurisdiction depends on the citizenship of the parties at the time suit is filed. See, e.g., Anderson v. Watt, 138 U.S. 694, 702-703, 34 L. Ed. 1078, 11 S. Ct. 449 (1891) ("And the [jurisdictional] inquiry is determined by the condition of the parties at the commencement of the suit"); see also Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Peoria & Pekin Union R. Co., 270 U.S. 580, 586, 70 L. Ed. 743, 46 S. Ct. 402 (1926) ("The jurisdiction of the lower court depends upon the state of things existing at the time the suit was brought"). The Dead Sea Companies  do not dispute that the time suit is filed is determinative under § 1332(a)(4), which provides for suits between "a foreign state, defined in section 1603(a) . . ., as plaintiff and citizens of a State or of different States." It would be anomalous to read § 1441(d)'s words, "foreign state as defined in section 1603(a)," differently.The Dead Sea Companies urge us to administer the FSIA like other status-based immunities, such as the qualified immunity accorded a state actor, that are based on the status  of an officer at the time of the conduct giving rise to the suit. We think its comparison is inapt. Our cases applying those immunities do not involve the interpretation of a statute. See, e.g., Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U.S. 483, 493-499, 40 L. Ed. 780, 16 S. Ct. 631 (1896) (basing a decision regarding official immunity on common law and considerations of "convenience and public policy"); Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 239-242, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90, 94 S. Ct. 1683 (1974).The reason for the official immunities in those cases does not apply here. The immunities for government officers prevent the threat of suit from "crippling the proper and effective administration of public affairs." Spalding, supra, at 498 (discussing immunity for executive officers); see also Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 554, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288, 87 S. Ct. 1213 (1967) (judicial immunity serves the public interest in judges who are "at liberty to exercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Foreign sovereign immunity, by contrast, is not meant to avoid chilling foreign states or their instrumentalities in the conduct of their business but to give foreign states and their instrumentalities some protection from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity between the United States and other sovereigns.Verlinden,461 U.S., at 486.

For the same reason, the Dead Sea Companies' reliance on Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 73 L. Ed. 2d 349, 102 S. Ct. 2690 (1982), is unavailing. There, we recognized that the President was immune from liability for official actions taken during his time in office, even against a suit filed when he was no longer serving in that capacity. The immunity served the same function that the other official immunities serve. See id., at 751 ("Because of the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of his energies by concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government"). As noted above, immunity under the FSIA does not serve the same purpose.The immunity recognized in Nixon was also based on a further rationale, one not applicable here: the constitutional  separation of powers. See id., at 749 ("We consider this immunity a functionally mandated incident of the President's unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of the separation of powers and supported by our history"). That rationale is not implicated by the statutory immunity Congress created for actions such as the one before us.

Any relationship recognized under the FSIA between the Dead Sea Companies and Israel had been severed before suit was commenced. As a result, the Dead Sea Companies  would not be entitled to instrumentality status even if their theory that instrumentality status could be conferred on a subsidiary were accepted.

* * *

For these reasons, we hold first that a foreign state must itself own a majority of the shares of a corporation if the corporation is to be deemed an instrumentality of the state under the provisions of the FSIA; and we hold second that instrumentality status is determined at the time of the filing of the complaint.

 The judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 01-594 is affirmed, and the writ of certiorari in No. 01-593 is dismissed.

It is so ordered.  


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Petitioner, Joseph Massaro, was indicted on federal racketeering charges, including murder in aid of racketeering, 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) [18 USCS § 1962(d)], in connection with the shooting death of Joseph Fiorito.  He was tried in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The day before Massaro's trial was to begin, prosecutors learned of what appeared to be a critical piece of evidence: a bullet allegedly recovered from the car in which the victim's body was found.  They waited for several days, however, to inform defense counsel of this development.  Not until the trial was underway and the defense had made its opening statement did they make this disclosure.  After the trial court and the defense had been informed of the development but still during the course of trial, defense counsel more than once declined the trial court's offer of a continuance so the bullet could be examined.  Massaro was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. 

On direct appeal new counsel for Massaro argued the District Court had erred in admitting the bullet in evidence, but he did not raise any claim relating to ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  The Court of  Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction.  Judgt. order reported at United States v. Massaro, 57 F.3d 1063 (1995). 

 Massaro later filed a motion under 28 USC § 2255 [28 USCS § 2255], seeking to vacate his conviction.  As relevant here, he claimed that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance in failing to accept the trial court's offer to grant a continuance. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York found this claim procedurally defaulted because Massaro could have raised it on direct appeal. 

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Massaro v. United States, 27 Fed. Appx. 26 (1995).  The court acknowledged that ineffective-assistance claims usually should be excused from procedural default rules because an attorney who handles both trial and appeal is unlikely to raise an ineffective-assistance claim against himself.  Nevertheless, it adhered to its decision in Billy-Eko v. United States, 8 F.3d 111 (1993).  Under Billy-Eko, when the defendant is represented by new counsel on appeal and the ineffective assistance claim is based solely on the record made at trial, the claim must be raised on direct appeal; failure to do so results in procedural default unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice.  Finding that Massaro was represented by new counsel on appeal, that his trial counsel's ineffectiveness was evident from the record, and that he had failed to show cause or prejudice, the Court of Appeals held him procedurally barred from bringing the ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review. 

We granted certiorari Massaro v. United States, 536 U.S. 990, 123 S. Ct. 31, 153 L. Ed. 2d 893 (2002).  Petitioner now urges us to hold that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel need not be raised on direct appeal, whether or not there is new counsel and whether or not the basis for the claim is apparent from the trial record. The Federal Courts of Appeals are in conflict on this question, with the Seventh Circuit joining the Second Circuit, see Guinan v. United States, 6 F.3d 468 (CA7 1993), and 10 other Federal Courts of Appeals taking the position that there is no procedural default for failure to raise an ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Cofske,157 F.3d 1, 2 (CA1 1998), cert denied, 526 US 1059, 143 L Ed 2d 533, 119 S Ct 1374 (1999); United States v. Jake, 281 F.3d 123, 132, n. 7 (CA3 2002); United States v. King, 119 F.3d 290, 295 (CA4 1997); United States v. Rivas, 157 F.3d 364, 369 (CA5 1998); United States v. Neuhausser, 241 F.3d 460, 474 (CA6), cert denied, 534 US 879, 151 L Ed 2d 125, 122 S Ct 181 (2001); United States v. Evans, 272 F.3d 1069, 1093 (CA8 2001), cert denied, 535 US 1029, 152 L Ed 2d 642, 122 S Ct 1638 (2002); United States v. Rewald, 889 F.2d 836, 859 (CA9 1989), cert denied, 498 US 819, 112 L Ed 2d 39, 111 S Ct 64 (1990); United States v. Galloway, 56 F.3d 1239, 1240 (CA10 1995) (en banc); United States v. Griffin, 699 F.2d 1102, 1107-1109 (CA11 1983); United States v. Richardson, 334 U.S. App. D.C. 384, 167 F.3d 621, 626 (CADC), cert denied, 528 US 895, 145 L Ed 2d 189, 120 S Ct 225 (1999).  We agree with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, and we reverse. 

 The background for our discussion is the general rule that claims not raised on direct appeal may not be raised on collateral review unless the petitioner shows cause and prejudice.  See United  States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 167, 71 L. Ed. 2d 816, 102 S. Ct. 1584 (1982); Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 621, 140 L. Ed. 2d 828, 118 S. Ct. 16041604 (1998).  The procedural default rule is neither a statutory nor a constitutional requirement, but it is a doctrine adhered to by the courts to conserve judicial resources and to respect the law's important interest in the finality of judgments.  We conclude that requiring a criminal defendant to bring ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal does not promote these objectives. 

 As Judge Easterbrook has noted, "[r]ules of procedure should be designed to induce litigants to present their contentions to the right tribunal at the right time." Guinan, supra, at 474 (concurring opinion).  Applying the usual procedural-default rule to ineffective-assistance claims would have the opposite effect, creating the risk that defendants would feel compelled to raise the issue before there has been an opportunity fully to develop the factual predicate for the claim.  Furthermore, the issue would be raised for the first time in a forum not best suited to assess those facts.  This is so even if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel's performance.  The better-reasoned approach is to permit ineffective-assistance claims to be brought in the first instance in a timely motion in the district court under § 2255.  We hold that an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under § 2255, whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal. 

 In light of the way our system has developed, in most cases a motion brought under § 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance. When an ineffective-assistance claim is brought on direct appeal, appellate counsel and the court must proceed on a trial record not developed precisely for the object of litigating or preserving the claim and thus often incomplete or inadequate for this purpose.  Under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984), a defendant claiming ineffective counsel must show that counsel's actions were not supported by a reasonable strategy and that the error was prejudicial. The evidence introduced at trial, however, will be devoted to issues of guilt or innocence, and the resulting record in many cases will not disclose the facts necessary to decide either prong of the Strickland analysis.  If the alleged error is one of commission, the record may reflect the action taken by counsel but not the reasons for it.  The appellate court may have no way of knowing whether a seemingly unusual or misguided action by counsel had a sound strategic motive or was taken because the counsel's alternatives were even worse.  See Guinan, supra, at 473 (Easterbrook, J., concurring) ("No matter how odd or deficient trial counsel's performance may seem, that lawyer may have had a reason for acting as he did.  . . .  Or it may turn out that counsel's overall performance was sufficient despite a glaring omission . . .").  The trial record may contain no evidence of alleged errors of omission, much less the reasons underlying them.  And evidence of alleged conflicts of interest might be found only in attorney-client correspondence or other documents that, in the typical  criminal trial, are not introduced.  See, e.g., Billy-Eko, 8 F.3d at 114.  Without additional factual development, moreover, an appellate court may not be able to ascertain whether the alleged error was prejudicial. 

 Under the rule we adopt today, ineffective-assistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.  The court may take testimony from witnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from the counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance.  See, e.g., Griffin, supra, at 1109 (In a § 2255 proceeding, the defendant "has a full opportunity to prove facts establishing ineffectiveness of counsel, the government has a full opportunity to present evidence to the contrary, the district court hears spoken words we can see only in print and sees expressions we will never see, and a factual record bearing precisely on the issue is created"); Beaulieu v. United States, 930 F.2d 805 (CA10 1991) (partially rev'd on other grounds United States v. Galloway, supra).  In addition, the § 2255 motion often will be ruled upon by the same district judge who presided at trial.  The judge, having observed the earlier trial, should have an advantageous perspective for determining the effectiveness of counsel's conduct and whether any deficiencies were prejudicial. 

The Second Circuit's rule creates inefficiencies for courts and counsel, both on direct appeal and in the collateral proceeding. On direct appeal it puts counsel into an awkward position vis-a-vis trial counsel.  Appellate counsel often need trial counsel's assistance in becoming familiar with a lengthy record on a short deadline, but trial counsel will be unwilling to help appellate counsel familiarize himself with a record for the purpose of understanding how it reflects trial counsel's own incompetence. 

Subjecting ineffective-assistance claims to the usual cause-and-prejudice rule also would create perverse incentives for counsel on direct appeal. To ensure that a potential ineffective assistance claim is not waived--and to avoid incurring a claim of ineffective counsel at the appellate stage--counsel would be pressured to bring claims of ineffective trial counsel, regardless of merit. 

Even meritorious claims would fail when brought on direct appeal if the trial record were inadequate to support them.  Appellate courts would waste time and resources attempting to address some claims that were meritless and other claims that, though colorable, would be handled more efficiently if addressed in the first instance by the district court on collateral  review. See, e.g., United States v. Galloway, 56 F.3d at 1241 ("threat of . . . procedural bar has doubtless resulted in many claims being asserted on direct appeal only to protect the record . . . unnecessarily burden[ing] both the parties and the court . . .").  This concern is far from speculative.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in light of its rule applying procedural default to ineffective-assistance claims, has urged counsel to "err on the side of inclusion on direct appeal," Billy-Eko, supra, at 116. 

On collateral review, the Second Circuit's rule would cause additional inefficiencies.  Under that rule a court on collateral review must determine  whether appellate counsel is "new." Questions may arise, for example, about whether a defendant has retained new appellate counsel when different lawyers in the same law office handle trial and appeal.  The habeas court also must engage in a painstaking review of the trial record solely to determine if it was sufficient to support the ineffectiveness claim and thus whether it should have been brought on direct appeal. A clear rule allowing these claims to be brought in a proceeding under § 2255, by contrast, will eliminate these requirements.  Although we could "require the parties and the district judges to search for needles in haystacks--to seek out the rare claim that could have been raised on direct appeal, and deem it waived," Guinan, 6 F.3d at 475 (Easterbrook, J., concurring)--we do not see the wisdom in requiring a court to spend time on exercises that, in most instances, will produce no benefit.  It is a better use of judicial resources to allow the district court on collateral review to turn at once to the merits. 

The most to be said for the rule in the Second Circuit is that it will speed resolution of some ineffective-assistance claims.  For the reasons discussed, however, we think few such claims will be capable of resolution on direct appeal and thus few will benefit from earlier resolution.  And the benefits of the Second Circuit's rule in those rare instances are outweighed by the increased judicial burden the rule would  impose in many other cases, where a district court on collateral review would be forced to conduct the cause-and-prejudice analysis before turning to the merits.  The Second Circuit's rule, moreover, does not produce the benefits of other rules requiring claims to be raised at the earliest opportunity--such as the contemporaneous objection rule--because here, raising the claim on direct appeal does not permit the trial court to avoid the potential error in the first place. 

 A growing majority of state courts now follow the rule we adopt today.  For example, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently changed its position to hold that "a claim raising trial counsel ineffectiveness will no longer be considered waived because new counsel on direct appeal did not raise a claim related to prior counsel's ineffectiveness." Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726, 738 (2002); see also id., at 735-738, and n 13 (cataloging other States' case law adopting this position). 

 Although the Government now urges us to adopt the rule of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Government took the opposite approach in some previous cases, arguing not only that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel could be brought in the first instance in a motion under § 2255, but that they must be brought in such a motion proceeding and not on direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 667, n. 42, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657, 104 S. Ct. 2039 (1984).  We do not go this far.  We do not hold that ineffective-assistance claims must be reserved for collateral review. There may be cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable to raise the issue on direct appeal. There may be instances, too, when obvious deficiencies in representation will be addressed by an appellate court sua sponte. In those cases, certain questions may arise in subsequent  proceedings under § 2255 concerning the conclusiveness of determinations made on the ineffective-assistance claims raised on direct appeal; but these matters of implementation are not before us.  We do hold that failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar the claim from being brought in a later, appropriate proceeding under § 2255. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 We granted certiorari to resolve whether the Nevada Supreme Court's refusal to extend full faith and credit to California's statute immunizing its tax collection agency from suit violates Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution .  We conclude it does not, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court. 

I 

Respondent Gilbert P. Hyatt filed a "part-year" resident income-tax return in California for 1991.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 54.  In the return, respondent represented that as of October 1, 1991, he had ceased to be a California resident and had become a resident of Nevada.  In 1993, petitioner California Franchise Tax Board (CFTB) commenced an audit to determine whether respondent had underpaid state income taxes.  Ibid. The audit focused on  respondent's claim that he had changed residency shortly before receiving substantial licensing fees for certain patented inventions related to computer technology. 

At the conclusion of its audit, CFTB determined that respondent was a California resident until April 3, 1992, and accordingly issued notices of proposed assessments for income taxes for 1991 and 1992 and imposed substantial civil fraud penalties.  Id., at 56-57, 58-59.  Respondent protested the proposed assessments and penalties in California through CFTB's administrative process.  See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code Ann. §§ 19041, 19044-19046 (West 1994). 

On January 6, 1998, with the administrative protest ongoing in California, respondent filed a lawsuit against CFTB in Nevada in Clark  County District Court.  Respondent alleges that CFTB directed "numerous and continuous contacts . . . at Nevada" and committed several torts during the course of the audit, including invasion of privacy, outrageous conduct, abuse of process, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 51-52, 54.  Respondent seeks punitive and compensatory damages.  Id., at 51-52.  He also sought a declaratory judgment "confirming [his] status as a Nevada resident effective as of September 26, 1991," id., at 51, but the District Court dismissed the claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on April 16, 1999, App. 93-95. 

During the discovery phase of the Nevada lawsuit, CFTB filed a petition in the Nevada Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus, or in the alternative, for a writ of prohibition, challenging certain of the District Court's discovery orders.  While that petition was pending, CFTB filed a motion in the District Court for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.  CFTB argued that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because principles of sovereign immunity, full faith and credit, choice of law, comity, and administrative exhaustion all required that the District Court apply California law, under which:  "Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused by: (a) Instituting any judicial or administrative proceeding or action for or incidental to the assessment or collection of a tax [or] (b) An act or omission in the interpretation or application of any law relating to a tax." Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 860.2 (West 1995).

The District Court denied CFTB's motion for summary judgment or dismissal, prompting CFTB to file a second petition in the Nevada Supreme Court.  This petition sought a writ of mandamus ordering the dismissal of the case, or in the alternative, a writ of prohibition and mandamus limiting the scope of the suit to claims arising out of conduct that occurred in Nevada. 

On June 13, 2001, the Nevada Supreme Court granted CFTB's second petition, dismissed the first petition as moot, and orderedthe District Court to enter summary judgment in favor of CFTB.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 38-43.  On April 4, 2002, however, the court granted respondent's petition for rehearing, vacated its prior ruling, granted CFTB's second petition in part, and denied it in part.  Id., at 5-18.  The court held that the District Court "should have declined to exercise its jurisdiction over the underlying negligence claim under comity principles" but that the intentional tort claims could proceed to trial.  Id., at 7. 

The Nevada Supreme Court noted that both Nevada and California have generally waived their sovereign immunity from suit in state court and "have extended the waivers to their state agencies or public employees except when state statutes expressly provide immunity." Id., at 9-10 (citing Nev. Rev. Stat. § 41.031 (1996); Cal. Const., Art. 3, § 5; and Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 820 (West 1995)).  Whereas Nevada has not conferred immunity on its state agencies for intentional torts committed within the course and scope of  employment, the court acknowledged  that "California has expressly provided [CFTB] with complete immunity." App. to Pet. for Cert. 10 (citing Cal. Govt. Code Ann. § 860.2 (West 1995) and Mitchell v. Franchise Tax Board, 183 Cal. App. 3d 1133, 228 Cal.Rptr. 750 (1986)).  To determine which State's law should apply, the court applied principles of comity. 

 Though the Nevada Supreme Court recognized the doctrine of comity as "an accommodation policy, under which the courts of one state voluntarily give effect to the laws and judicial decisions of another state out of deference and respect, to promote harmonious interstate relations," the court also recognized its duty to determine whether the application of California law "would contravene Nevada's policies or interests," giving "due regard to the duties, obligations, rights and convenience of Nevada's citizens." App. to Pet. for Cert. 11.  "An investigation is generally considered to be a discretionary function," the Court observed, "and Nevada provides its [own] agencies with immunity for the performance of a discretionary function even if the discretion is abused." Id., at 12.  "Affording [CFTB] statutory immunity for negligent acts," the Court therefore concluded, does not contravene any Nevada interest in this case." Ibid. The Court accordingly held that "the district court should have declined to exercise its jurisdiction" over respondent's negligence claim under principles of comity. Id., at 7.  With respect to the intentional torts, however, the court held that "affording [CFTB] statutory immunity . . . does contravene Nevada's policies and interests in this case." Id., at 12.  Because Nevada "does not allow its agencies to claim immunity for discretionary acts taken in bad faith, or for intentional torts committed in the course and scope of employment," the Court held that "Nevada's interest in protecting its citizens from injurious intentional torts and bad faith acts committed by sister states' government employees" should be accorded  greater weight "than California's policy favoring complete immunity for its taxation agency." Id., at 12-13. 

We granted certiorari to resolve whether Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution requires Nevada to give full faith and credit to California's statute providing its tax agency with immunity from suit, 537 U. S 946, 537 U.S. 946, 123 S. Ct. 409; 154 L. Ed. 2d 289 (2002) , and we now affirm. 

II 

 The Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause provides: "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.  And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof." Art. IV, § 1.  As we have explained, "our precedent differentiates the credit owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to judgments." Baker v. General Motors Corp.,522 U.S. 222, 232, 139 L. Ed. 2d 580, 118 S. Ct. 657 (1998).  Whereas the full faith and credit command "is exacting" with respect to "[a] final judgment . . . rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment," id., at 233, 139 L. Ed. 2d 580, 118 S. Ct. 657 it is less demanding with respect to choice of laws.  We  have held that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not compel "'a state to substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate.'" Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman,486 U.S. 717, 722, 100 L. Ed. 2d 743, 108 S. Ct. 2117 (1988) (quoting Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n,306 U.S. 493, 501, 83 L. Ed. 940, 59 S. Ct. 629 (1939)). 

 The State of Nevada is undoubtedly "competent to legislate" with respect to the subject matter of the alleged intentional torts here, which, it is claimed, have injured one of its citizens within its borders.  "'For a State's substantive law to be selected in a constitutionally permissible manner, that State must have a significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts, creating state interests, such that choice of its law is neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair.'" Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,472 U.S. 797, 818, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985) (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague,449 U.S. 302, 312-313, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (1981) (plurality opinion)); see id., at 822-823, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 101 S. Ct. 633 .  Such contacts are manifest in this case: the plaintiff claims to have suffered injury in Nevada while a resident there; and it is undisputed that at least some of the conduct alleged to be tortious occurred in Nevada, Brief for Petitioner 33-34, n 16.  See, e.g., Carroll v. Lanza,349 U.S. 408, 413, 99 L. Ed. 1183, 75 S. Ct. 804 (1955) ("The State where the tort occurs certainly has a concern in the problems following in the wake of the injury"); Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra, at 503, 83 L. Ed. 2d 940, 59 S. Ct. 629 ("Few matters could be deemed more appropriately the concern of the state in which [an] injury occurs or more completely within its power"). 

CFTB does not contend otherwise.  Instead, CFTB urges this Court to adopt a "new rule" mandating that a state court extend full faith and credit to a sister State's statutorily recaptured sovereign immunity from suit when a refusal to do so would "interfere with a State's capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities." Brief for Petitioner 13 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

We have, in the past, appraised and balanced state interests when invoking the Full Faith and Credit Clause to resolve conflicts between overlapping laws of coordinate States.  See Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper,286 U.S. 145, 76 L. Ed. 1026, 52 S. Ct. 571 (1932) (holding that the Constitution required a federal court sitting in New Hampshire to apply a Vermont workers' compensation statute in a tort suit brought by the widow of a Vermont worker killed in New Hampshire).  This balancing approach quickly proved unsatisfactory.  Compare Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532, 550, 79 L. Ed. 1044, 55 S. Ct. 518 (1935) (holding that a forum State, which was the place of hiring but not of a claimant's domicile, could apply its own law to compensate for an accident in another State, because "no persuasive reason" was shown for requiring application of the law of the State where the  accident occurred), with Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra, at 504-505, 83 L. Ed. 2d 940, 59 S. Ct. 629 (holding that the State where an accident occurred could apply its own workers' compensation law and  need not give full faith and credit to that of the State of hiring and domicile of the employer and employee).  As Justice Robert H. Jackson, recounting these cases, aptly observed, "it [is] difficult to point to any field in which the Court has more completely demonstrated or more candidly confessed the lack of guiding standards of a legal character than in trying to determine what choice of law is required by the Constitution." Full Faith and Credit--The Lawyer's Clause of the Constitution, 45 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 16 (1945). 

In light of this experience, we abandoned the balancing-of-interests approach to conflicts of law under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hague,449 U.S. 302, 308, n 10, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (plurality opinion); id., at 322, n 6, 66 L. Ed 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 339, n 6, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (Powell, J., dissenting).  We have recognized, instead, that "it is frequently the case under the Full Faith and Credit Clause that a court can lawfully apply either the law of one State or the contrary law of another." Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 727, 100 L. Ed. 2d 743, 108 S. Ct. 2117.  We thus have held that a State need not "substitute the statutes of other states for its own statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is competent to legislate." Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra, at 501, 83 L. Ed. 2d 940, 59 S. Ct. 629; see Baker v. General Motors Corp., supra, at 232, 139 L. Ed. 2d 580, 118 S. Ct. 657; Sun Oil Co. v. Wortman, supra, at 722, 100 L. Ed. 2d 743; Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, supra, at 818-819, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965.  Acknowledging this shift, CFTB contends that this case demonstrates the need for a new rule under the Full Faith and Credit Clause that will protect "core sovereignty" interests as expressed in state statutes delineating the contours of the State's immunity from suit.  Brief for Petitioner 13. 

We disagree.  We have confronted the question whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires a forum State to  recognize a sister State's legislatively recaptured immunity once before.  In Nevada v. Hall,440 U.S. 410, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416, 99 S. Ct. 1182 (1979), an employee of the University of Nevada was involved in an automobile accident with California residents, who filed suit in California and named Nevada as a defendant.  The California courts refused to apply a Nevada statute that capped damages in tort suits against the State on the ground that "to surrender jurisdiction or to limit respondents' recovery to the $ 25,000 maximum of the Nevada statute would be obnoxious to its statutorily based policies of jurisdiction over nonresident motorists and full recovery." Id., at 424, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416, 99 S. Ct. 1182.

 We affirmed, holding, first, that the Constitution does not confer sovereign immunity on States in the courts of sister States.  Id., at 414-421, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416, 99 S. Ct. 1182.  Petitioner does not ask us to reexamine that ruling, and we therefore decline the invitation of petitioner's amici States, see Brief for the States of Oregon, et al. as Amici Curiae 2, to do so.  See this Court's Rule 14.1(a); Mazer v. Stein,347 U.S. 201, 206, n. 5, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460, 1954 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 308 (1954) ("We do not reach for constitutional questions not raised by the parties"). 

The question presented here instead  implicates Hall's second holding: that the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not require California to apply Nevada's sovereign immunity statutes where such application would violate California's own legitimate public policy.  Nevada v. Hall, 440 US 410, 424, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416, 99 S Ct 1182 (1979).  The Court observed in a footnote: "California's exercise of jurisdiction in this case poses no substantial threat to our constitutional system of cooperative federalism.  Suits involving traffic accidents occurring outside of Nevada could hardly interfere with Nevada's capacity to fulfill its own sovereign responsibilities.  We have no occasion, in this case, to consider whether different state policies, either of California or of Nevada, might require a different analysis or a different result." Id., at 424, n. 24, 59 L. Ed 2d 416, 99 S. Ct. 1182 .

 CFTB asserts that an analysis of this lawsuit's effects should lead to a different result: that the Full Faith and Credit Clause requires Nevada to apply California's immunity statute to avoid interference with California's "sovereign responsibility" of enforcing its income tax laws.  Brief for Petitioner 13. 

Our past experience with appraising and balancing state interests under the Full Faith and Credit Clause counsels against adopting CFTB's proposed new rule. Having recognized, in Hall, that a suit against a State in a sister State's court "necessarily implicates the power and authority" of both sovereigns, id., at 416, 59 L. Ed. 2d 416, 99 S. Ct. 1182, the question of which sovereign interest should be deemed more weighty is not one that can be easily answered.  Yet petitioner's rule would elevate California's sovereignty interests above those of Nevada, were we to deem this lawsuit an interference with California's "core sovereign responsibilities." We rejected as "unsound in principle and unworkable in practice" a rule of state immunity from federal regulation under the Tenth Amendment that turned on whether a particular state government function was "integral" or "traditional." Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,469 U.S. 528, 546-547, 83 L. Ed. 2d 1016, 105 S. Ct. 1005 (1985).  CFTB has convinced us of neither the relative soundness nor the relative practicality of adopting a similar distinction here. 

 Even were we inclined to embark on a course of balancing States' competing sovereign interests to resolve conflicts of laws under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, this case would not present the occasion to do so.  There is no principled distinction between Nevada's interests in tort claims arising out of its university employee's automobile accident, at issue inHall, and California's interests in the tort claims here arising out of its tax collection agency's residency audit. To be sure, the power to promulgate and enforce income tax laws is an essential attribute of sovereignty. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Postal Service,467 U.S. 512, 523, 81 L. Ed. 2d 446, 104 S. Ct. 2549 (1984) ("'Taxes are the life-blood of government'" (quoting Bull v. United States,295 U.S. 247, 259, 79 L. Ed. 1421, 55 S. Ct. 695, 81 Ct. Cl. 974, 1935-1 C.B. 310 (1935))).  But the university employee's educational mission in Hall might also be so described.  Cf. Brown v. Board of Education,347 U.S. 483, 493, 98 L. Ed. 873, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954) ("Education is perhaps the most  important function of state and local governments"). 

 If we were to compare the degree to which the allegedly tortious acts here and in Hall are related to a core sovereign function, we would be left to ponder the relationship between an automobile accident and educating, on one hand, and the intrusions alleged here and collecting taxes, on the other.  We discern no constitutionally significant distinction between these relationships.  To the extent CFTB complains of the burdens and expense of out-of-state litigation, and the diversion of state resources away from the performance of important state functions, those burdens do not distinguish this case from any other out-of-state lawsuit against California or one of its agencies. 

States' sovereignty interests are not foreign to the full faith and credit command.  But we are not presented here with a case in which a State has exhibited a "policy of hostility to the public Acts" of a sister State.  Carroll v. Lanza,349 U.S. 408, 413, 99 L. Ed. 2d 1183, 75 S. Ct. 804 (1955) The Nevada Supreme Court sensitively applied principles of comity with a healthy regard for California's sovereign status, relying on the contours of Nevada's own sovereign immunity from suit as a benchmark for its analysis.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 10-13. 

In short, we heed the lessons learned as a result of Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper,286 U.S. 145, 76 L. Ed. 1026, 52 S. Ct. 571 (1932), and its progeny.  Without a rudder to steer us, we decline to embark on the constitutional course of balancing coordinate States' competing sovereign interests to resolve conflicts of laws under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 

The judgment of the Nevada Supreme Court is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The question is whether the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA or Act), that suit under the Act "may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," 52 Stat 1069, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 216(b), bars removal of a suit from state to federal court.  We hold there is no bar. 

I 

Petitioner, Phillip T. Breuer, sued respondent, his former employer, Jim's Concrete of Brevard, Inc., in a state court of Florida for unpaid wages, liquidated damages, prejudgment interest, and attorney's fees.  Section 216(b) provides not only that an employer who violates its minimum wage and overtime provisions is liable to an employee, but that "[a]n action to recover the liability prescribed . . . may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction." 

Jim's Concrete removed the case to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida under 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), which reads that "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United  States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending." Breuer sought an order remanding the case to state court, arguing that removal was improper owing to the FLSA's  provision that an action "may be maintained" in any state court, a provision that Breuer put forward as an express exception to the general authorization of removal under § 1441(a).  Though the District Court denied Breuer's motion, it certified the issue for interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b).  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed, saying that Congress had expressly barred removal in "direct, unequivocal language" in other statutes,292 F.3d 1308, 1310 (2002), but was not comparably prohibitory in § 216(b).  The Eleventh Circuit thus joined the First, seeCosme Nieves v. Deshler, 786 F.2d 445 (1986), but placed itself at odds with the Eighth, seeJohnson v. Butler Bros., 162 F.2d 87 (1947) (denying removability under FLSA).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflictBreuer v. Jim's Concrete of Brevard, Inc.,537 U.S. 1099, 154 L. Ed. 2d 767, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 553, 123 S. Ct. 816 (2003) and now affirm. 

II 

A 

 There is no question that Breuer could have begun his action in the District Court.  The FLSA provides that an action "may be maintained . . . in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," § 216(b), and the district courts would in any event have original jurisdiction over FLSA claims under 28 USC § 1331 [28 USCS § 1331], as "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States," and § 1337(a), as "arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce." Removal of FLSA actions is thus prohibited under § 1441(a) only if Congress expressly provided as much. 

 Nothing on the face of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) looks like an express prohibition of removal, there being no mention of removal, let alone of prohibition.  While § 216(b) provides  that an action "may be maintained . . . in any . . . State court of competent jurisdiction," the word "maintain" enjoys a breadth of meaning that leaves its bearing on removal ambiguous at best.  "To maintain an action" may mean "to continue" to litigate, as opposed to "commence" an action. 1 Actually, there is reason to think that this sense of "maintain" was intended. Under the FLSA, the Secretary of Labor may file a suit on behalf of an employee to recover unpaid wages or overtime compensation, and when the Secretary files such a suit, an employee's right to bring a comparable action terminates, see, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 216(c).  Congressional reports suggest that although an employee may no longer initiate a new action once the Secretary has sued, an employee may continue to litigate, i.e., "maintain," an action already pending.  See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 327, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p 20 (1961) (filing of the Secretary's complaint would "not, however, operate to terminate any employee's right to maintain such a private suit to which he had become a party plaintiff before the Secretary's action"); S. Rep. No. 145, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., p 39 (1961) (Secretary's filing of complaint "terminates the rights of individuals to later file suit"); cf.Smallwood v. Gallardo,275 U.S. 56, 61, 72 L. Ed. 152, 48 S. Ct. 23 (1927) ("To maintain a suit is to uphold, continue on foot and keep from collapse a suit already begun").  Seen in this light, Congress's use of the term "maintain" is easy to understand, carrying no implication for removal. Black's Law  Dictionary 1143 (3d ed. 1933).  But "maintain" in reference to a legal action is often read as "bring" or "file"; "[t]o maintain an action or suit may mean to commence or institute it; the term imports the existence of a cause of action." Ibid.; see 1A J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice P 0.167[5], p 472 (2d ed. 1996) (calling the "'may be maintained'" language an "ambiguous phrase" and "certainly not an express provision against removal within the  meaning of § 1441"); 14C C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3729, p 235 (1998) (referring to "use of the ambiguous term 'maintain' in the statute").  The most, then, that Breuer can claim simply from the use of the term "maintain" is that any text, even when ambiguous, that might be read as inconsistent with removal is an "express" prohibiting provision under the statute.  But if an ambiguous term like "maintain" qualified as an express provision  for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a), then the requirement of an "expres[s]provi[sion]" would call for nothing more than a "provision," pure and simple, leaving the word "expressly" with no consequence whatever.  "[E]xpres[s] provi[sion]" must mean something more than any verbal hook for an argument. 

 The need to take the express exception requirement seriously is underscored by examples of indisputable prohibitions of removal in a number of other statutes.  Section 1445, for example, provides that "(a) A civil action in any State court against a railroad or its receivers or trustees . . . may not be removed to any district court of the United States. "(b) A civil action in any State court against a carrier or its receivers or trustees to recover damages for delay, loss, or injury of shipments . . . may not be removed to any district court of the United States unless the matter in controversy exceeds $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs. "(c) A civil action in any State court arising under the workmen's compensation laws of such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States. "(d) A civil action in any State court arising under . . . the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 may not be removed to any district court of the United States."

See also 15 U.S.C. § 77v(a) ("[N]o case arising under [the Securities Act of 1933] and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States"); § 1719 ("No case arising under [the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act] and  brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States, except where the United States or any officer or employee of the United States in his official capacity is a party"); § 3612 ("No case arising under [the Condominium and Cooperative Abuse Relief Act of 1980] and brought in any State court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the United States, except where any officer or employee of the United States in his official capacity is a party").  When Congress has "wished to  give plaintiffs an absolute choice of forum, it has shown itself capable of doing so in unmistakable terms." Cosme Nieves, 786 F.2d at 451.  It has not done so here. 

B 

None of Breuer's refinements on his basic argument from the term "maintain" puts him in a stronger position.  He goes on to say, for example, that interpretation does not stop at the dictionary, and he argues that the statutory phrase "may be maintained" shows up as sufficiently prohibitory once it is coupled with a  federal policy of construing removal jurisdiction narrowly.  Breuer relies heavily on our statement inShamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets,313 U.S. 100, 85 L. Ed. 1214, 61 S. Ct. 868 (1941), that "the policy of the successive acts of Congress regulating the jurisdiction of federal courts is one calling for the strict construction of [removal legislation] . . . .  'Due regard for the rightful independence of state governments, which should actuate federal courts, requires that they scrupulously confine their own jurisdiction to the precise limits . . . the statute has defined.'" Id., at 108-109 (quotingHealy v. Ratta,292 U.S. 263, 270, 78 L. Ed. 1248, 54 S. Ct. 700 (1934)).  But whatever apparent force this argument might have claimed whenShamrock was handed down has been qualified by later statutory development.  At the time that case was decided, § 1441 provided simply that any action within original federal subject-matter jurisdiction could be removed.  Fourteen years later, however, it was amended into its present form, requiring any exception to the general removability rule to be express.  See Act of June 25, 1948, § 1441(a), 62 Stat 937 (authorizing removal over civil suits within the district courts' original jurisdiction "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress"); see also 28 USC § 1441 [28 USCS § 1441] (historical and revision  notes).  Since 1948, therefore, there has been no question that whenever the subject matter of an action qualifies it for removal, the burden is on a plaintiff to find an express exception. As Shamrock itself said, "the language of the Act . . . evidence[s] the Congressional purpose," 313 US, at 108, 85 L Ed 1214, 61 S Ct 868, and congressional insistence on express exception is hardly satisfied by the malleability of the term "maintain" in the text Breuer relies upon. 

 Nor does it do Breuer any good to emphasize a sense of "maintain" as implying continuation of an action to final judgment, so as to give a plaintiff who began an action the statutory right under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b) to see it through.  We may concede that it does, and the concession leaves the term "maintain" just as ambiguous as ever on the issue before us. 2As to individual cases brought before the institution of any suit by the government, see n 1, supra. The right to maintain an action may indeed be a right to fight to the finish, but removal does nothing to defeat that right; far from concluding a case before final judgment, removal just transfers it from one forum to another.  As between a state and a federal forum, the statute seems to betray an indifference, with its provision merely for maintaining action "in any Federal or State court," Ibid.

But even if the text of § 216(b) were not itself reason enough to doubt that the provision conveys any right to remain in the original forum, the implication of Breuer's position would certainly raise misgivings about his point.  For if the phrase "[a]n action . . . may be maintained" meant that a plaintiff could insist on keeping an FLSA case wherever he filed it in the first place, it would seem that an FLSA case brought in a federal district court could never be transferred to a different one over the plaintiff's objection, a result that would plainly clash with the provision  for change of venue, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) ("For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may  transfer  any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought"). 

 It is, finally, a like concern about consequences that leaves us with fatal reservations about Breuer's pragmatic appeal that many claims under the FLSA are for such small amounts that removal to a sometimes distant federal court may make it less convenient and more expensive for employees to vindicate their rights effectively.  This may often be true, but even if its truth somehow justified winking at the ambiguity of the term "maintain," the implications would keep us from going Breuer's way.  A number of other statutes incorporate or use the same language as § 216(b), see 29 U.S.C. § 626(b) (providing that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 "shall be enforced in accordance with the powers, remedies, and procedures provided in" § 216(b) and other sections of the FLSA); § 2005(c)(2) ("An action to recover the liability prescribed [under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988] in paragraph (1) may be maintained against the employer in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction"); § 2617(a)(2) ("An action to recover the damages or equitable relief [under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993] prescribed in paragraph (1) may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees").  Breuer, then, cannot have a removal exception for the FLSA without entailing exceptions for other statutory actions, to the point that it becomes just too hard to believe that a right to "maintain" an action was ever meant to displace the right to remove. 3 Breuer points to two nonjudicial authorities that do nothing to assuage our skepticism.  He calls our attention to the position taken by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor, in an amicus brief filed before the Eighth Circuit inJohnson v. Butler Bros., 162 F.2d 87 (1947), arguing that the text of the FLSA and the policies motivating its passage demonstrate that FLSA actions may not be removed to federal court.  But this brief is not persuasive authority.  The Secretary has no responsibility for applying the removal statute and no particular authority to interpret it; the Secretary's opinion cannot make up for the absence of express statutory language.  Breuer also points to a Senate Report accompanying the 1958 enactment of 28 USC § 1445 [28 USCS § 1445], a provision barring removal of workers' compensation actions under state law.  Referring to actions brought under the FLSA, the report states "[i]f filed in the State courts the law prohibits removal to the Federal court." S. Rep. No. 1830, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., p 9 (1958).  But a stray comment in a congressional report stands a long way from an express statutory provision.

 III 

 Breuer's case was properly removed under 28 USC § 1441 [28 USCS § 1441], and the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This case stems from a California county's investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation. The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. 

The parties and, as amicus curiae, the United States agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the United States, is not a "person" subject to suit under 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983].  We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a "person" who may sue under § 1983.  Whether the Tribe's suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than § 1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question. 

I 

The Bishop Paiute Tribe is a federally recognized tribe located on the Bishop Paiute Reservation in California.  The Bishop Paiute Gaming Corporation, chartered and wholly owned by the Tribe, operates and manages the Paiute Palace Casino, a tribal gaming operation run under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 102 Stat 2467, 25 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 

In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and Human Services received information from the State Department of Social Services indicating that three Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings on their applications for state welfare benefits.  Brief for Petitioners 4-5.  According to the  County, the employees failed to respond when the Department requested that they reconcile the apparent discrepancies between their Casino earnings and their welfare application forms.  Id., at 5.  The Department then forwarded the matter to the Inyo County District Attorney's Office, which, in turn, asked the employees to reconcile the apparent discrepancies.  Id., at 6.  That request, the County asserts, was also ignored.  Ibid.

In February 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the Casino for the three employees' employment records, explaining that it was investigating "alleged welfare fraud." 291 F.3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees' consent. 

 The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe. 1The United States maintains, and the County does not dispute, that the Corporation is an "arm" of the Tribe for sovereign immunity purposes.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11-14. The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino's personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation. 

 In July 2000, the District Attorney's Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee's signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials. The District Attorney refused the offer. 2At oral argument, the County defended this refusal by asserting that federal law prohibited it from releasing the relevant pages of the employees' welfare applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5.  But the United States assured the Court that "[t]here is no Federal regulation or other Federal requirement" that would have prevented the County from sharing the relevant information with the Tribe. Id., at 21.  This entire controversy, it thus appears, might have been avoided had the county officials understood that federal law allowed the accommodation sought by the Tribe.

 To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under 28 USC §§ 1331, 1337, 1343(i)(3)(4) [28 USCS §§ 1331, 1337, 1343(a)(3)(4), and the "federal common law of Indian affairs," the Tribe sought injunctive and declaratory relief to  vindicate its status as a sovereign immune from state processes under federal law, and to establish that state law was preempted to the extent that it purported to authorize seizure of tribal records.  App. 97, P 1, 105-114, PP 26-53.  The Tribe's complaint also sought relief under 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983], including compensatory damages.  In this regard, the Tribe alleged that by acting beyond the scope of their jurisdiction and "without authorization of law" in executing the warrant, 3The Tribe did not dispute the State's authority over the crimes under investigation.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29. the defendants violated the Tribe's and Corporation's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments rights, and the Tribe's right to self-government. App. 109, P 38; see id., at 108-110, PP 33-39. 

  On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants' motion, dismissed the Tribe's complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino's personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, "[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California's criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property." App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.  The court also held that the District Attorney and the Sheriff had qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities.  Id., at 57a-58a. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's judgment dismissing the action.  "[E]xecution of a search warrant against the Tribe," the Court of Appeals said, "interferes with 'the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.'" 291 F.3d at 558 (quotingWilliams v. Lee,358 U.S. 217, 220, 3 L. Ed. 2d 251, 79 S. Ct. 269 (1959)).  In the appellate court's view, the District Court should not have "balanced the interests at stake" to determine whether the warrant was enforceable.  291 F.3d at 559.  This Court's precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced "a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction . . . over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear grant of authority by Congress." Ibid. (citingOklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Chickasaw Nation,515 U.S. 450, 458, 132 L. Ed. 2d 400, 115 S. Ct. 2214 (1995)). 

"[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework," the Court of Appeals added, "the balance of interests favors a ruling for the Tribe." 291 F.3d at 559.  The Tribe's privacy policies regarding employee records "promote tribal [self-government] interests," the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered "a trusting relationship with tribal members," and "affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe's predominant source of economic development revenue." Ibid. The appeals court recognized the State's countervailing "interest in investigating potential welfare  fraud," but thought it incumbent upon  the State to further that interest "through far less intrusive means." Ibid.

The Court of Appeals also ruled that the District Attorney and the Sheriff were not shielded by qualified immunity. "[A] reasonable county officer," it held, "would have known . . . that seizing tribal property  held on tribal land violated the Fourth Amendment because the property and land were outside the officer's jurisdiction." Id., at 568.  The appeals court acknowledged prior Ninth Circuit precedent holding that the right to tribal self-government is not protected by § 1983. Id., at 568, n. 7 (citingHoopa Valley Tribe v. Nevins, 881 F.2d 657 (1989)); see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29, n 15.  But in this case, the Court of Appeals concluded, a § 1983 claim could be maintained because the Tribe sought "protection from an unlawful search and seizure," a right secured by the Fourth Amendment and therefore within § 1983's compass. 291 F.3d at 568, and n 7.  On December 2, 2002, we granted certiorari. 537 U.S. 1043, 537 U.S. 1043, 154 L. Ed. 2d 514, 123 S. Ct. 618(2002). 

II 

 Central to our review is the question whether the Tribe's complaint is actionable under § 1983. That provision permits "citizen[s]" and "other person[s] within the jurisdiction" of the United States to seek legal and equitable relief from "person[s]" who, under color of state law, deprive them of federally protected rights. 4The relevant portion of 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983] reads: "Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress." InWill v. Michigan Dep't of State Police,491 U.S. 58, 105 L. Ed. 2d 45, 109 S. Ct. 2304 (1989), this Court held that a State is not a "person" amenable to suit under § 1983.  "[I]n enacting § 1983 ," the Court said, "Congress did not intend to override well-established immunities or defenses under the common law," including "[t]he doctrine of sovereign immunity." Id., at 67.  Although this case does not squarely present the question, the parties agree, and we will assume for purposes of this opinion, that Native American tribes, like States of the Union, are not subject to suit under § 1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 35-38; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49;Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.,523 U.S. 751, 754, 140 L. Ed. 2d 981, 118 S. Ct. 1700 (1998) ("an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity"). 

The issue pivotal here is whether a tribe qualifies as a claimant--a "person within the jurisdiction" of the United States--under § 1983. 5Courts of Appeals have expressed divergent views on this question.  SeeNative Village of Venetie IRA Council v. Alaska, 155 F.3d 1150, 1152, n. 1 (CA9 1998) (concluding that Tribes are persons entitled to sue under § 1983);American Vantage Co. v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 292 F.3d 1091, 1097, n. 4 (CA9 2002) ("[I]t is doubtful whether [a] Tribe qua sovereign would qualify as a 'citizen of the United States or other person' eligible to bring an action under § 1983." (quotingWhite Mountain Apache Tribe v. Williams, 810 F.2d 844, 865, n. 16 (CA9 1987) (Fletcher, J., dissenting))); cf.Illinois v. Chicago, 137 F.3d 474, 477 (CA7 1998) (stating in dictum that "a state is not a 'person' under [§ 1983]");Pennsylvania v. Porter, 659 F.2d 306, 314-318 (CA3 1981) (en banc) (holding that a State may bring a § 1983 action in a parens patriae capacity). The United States maintains it does not, invoking the Court's "longstanding interpretive presumption that 'person' does not include the sovereign," a presumption that "may be disregarded only upon some affirmative showing of statutory intent to  the contrary." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (quotingVermont Agency of Natural  Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780-781, 146 L. Ed. 2d 836, 120 S. Ct. 1858 (2000)); seeWill, 491 U.S., at 64.  Nothing in the text, purpose, or history of § 1983, the Government contends, overcomes the interpretive presumption  that "'person' does not include the sovereign." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7-8 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  Furthermore, the Government urges, given the Court's decision that "person" excludes sovereigns as defendants under § 1983, it would be anomalous for the Court to give the same word a different meaning when it appears later in the same sentence.  Id., at 8; seeBrown v. Gardner,513 U.S. 115, 118, 130 L. Ed. 2d 462, 115 S. Ct. 552 (1994) (the "presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute" is "surely at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence"); cf.Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co.,435 U.S. 389, 397, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364, 98 S. Ct. 1123 (1978) (because municipalities are "persons" entitled to sue under the antitrust laws, they are also, in principle, "persons" capable of being sued under those laws). 

The Tribe responds that Congress intended § 1983 "to provide a powerful civil remedy 'against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights.'" Brief for Respondents 45 (quotingMonell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,436 U.S. 658, 700-701, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611, 98 S. Ct. 2018 (1978)).  To achieve that remedial purpose, the Tribe maintains, § 1983 should be "broadly construed." Brief for Respondents 45 (citingMonell, 436 U.S., at 684-685) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indian tribes, the Tribe here asserts, "have been especially vulnerable to infringement of their federally protected rights by states." Brief for Respondents 42 (citing, inter alia,The Kansas Indians,72 U.S. 737, 5 Wall. 737, 18 L. Ed. 667 (1867) (state taxation of tribal lands);Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians, 526 U.S. 172, 143 L. Ed. 2d 270, 119 S. Ct. 1187 (1999) (state infringement on tribal rights to hunt, fish, and gather on ceded lands);Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield,490 U.S. 30, 104 L. Ed. 2d 29, 109 S. Ct. 1597 (1989) (tribal jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings);California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,480 U.S. 202, 94 L. Ed. 2d 244, 107 S. Ct. 1083 (1987) (state attempt to regulate gambling on tribal land)).  To guard against such infringements, the Tribe contends, the  Court should read § 1983 to encompass suits brought by Indian tribes. 

 As we have recognized in other contexts, qualification of a sovereign as a "person" who may maintain a particular claim for relief depends not "upon a bare analysis of the word 'person,'"Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India,434 U.S. 308, 317, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563, 98 S. Ct. 584 (1978), but on the "legislative environment" in which the word appears,Georgia v. Evans,316 U.S. 159, 161, 86 L. Ed. 1346, 62 S. Ct. 972 (1942).  Thus, in Georgia, the Court held that a State, as purchaser of asphalt shipped in interstate commerce, qualified as a "person" entitled to seek redress under the Sherman Act for restraint of trade. Id., at 160-163, 316 U.S. 159, 86 L Ed 1346, 62 S Ct 972.  Similarly, in Pfizer, the Court held that a foreign  nation, as purchaser of antibiotics, ranked as a "person" qualified to sue pharmaceuticals manufacturers under our antitrust laws. Pfizer, 434 U.S., at 309-320; cf.Stevens, 529 U.S., at 787, and n 18, 529 U.S. 765, 146 L Ed 2d 836, 120 S Ct 1858 (deciding States are not "person[s]" subject to qui tam liability under the False Claims Act, but leaving open the question whether they "can be 'persons' for purposes of commencing an FCA qui tam action" (emphasis deleted));United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. 200, 213, 149 L. Ed. 2d 401, 121 S. Ct. 1433 (2001) ("Although we generally presume that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning, the presumption is not rigid, and the meaning of the same words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law." (internal quotation marks, brackets, and citations omitted)). 

 There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribe's asserted "sovereign" status that it claims immunity from the County's processes.  See App. 97-105, PP 1-25, 108-110, PP 33-39;291 F.3d at 554 (Court of Appeals "find[s] that the County and its agents violated the Tribe's sovereign immunity when they obtained and executed a search warrant against the Tribe and tribal  property." (emphasis added)). Section 1983 was designed to secure private rights against government encroachment, seeWill, 491 U.S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign's prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a Fourth Amendment violation would be a "person" qualified to sue under § 1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause. Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under § 1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims. 6It hardly "demean[s] . . . Native American Tribes," see post, at 538 U.S. 701, 155 L. Ed. 2d 933, at 944, 123 S. Ct. 1887 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), in our view, to bracket them with States of the Union in this regard.

III 

 In addition to § 1983, the Tribe asserted as law under which its claims arise the "federal common law of Indian affairs." Supra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 939 (quoting App. 97, P 1).  But the Tribe has not explained, and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals appears to have carefully considered, what prescription of federal common law enables a tribe to maintain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief establishing its sovereign right to be free from state criminal processes.  In short, absent § 1983 as a foundation for the Tribe's action, it is unclear what federal law, if any, the Tribe's case "aris[es] under." 28 USC § 1331 [28 USCS § 1331].  We therefore remand for focused consideration and resolution of that jurisdictional question. * * * 

The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Petitioner, a nonprofit trade association that represents concessioners doing business in the national parks, challenges a National Park Service (NPS) regulation that purports  to render the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), 92 Stat 2383, 41 U.S.C. § 601 et seq[41 USCS §§ 601et seq.], inapplicable to concession contracts.  We conclude that the controversy is not yet ripe for judicial resolution. 

I 

The CDA establishes rules governing disputes arising out of certain Government contracts. 1Title 41 U.S.C. § 602(a) [41 USCS § 602(a)] provides: "Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, this chapter applies to any express or implied contract (including those of the nonappropriated fund activities described in sections 1346 and 1491 of title 28) entered into by an executive agency for-- "(1) the procurement of property, other than real property in being; "(2) the procurement of services; "(3) the procurement of construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of real property; or, "(4) the disposal of personal property." The statute provides that these disputes first be submitted to an agency's contracting officer.  § 605.  A Government contractor dissatisfied with the contracting officer's decision may seek review either from the United States Court of Federal Claims or from an administrative board in the agency.  See §§ 606, 607(d), 609(a).  Either decision may then be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 2The CDA also provides that a prevailing contractor is entitled to prejudgment interest.  § 611. See 28 USC § 1295 [28 USCS § 1295]; 41 U.S.C. § 607(g) [41 USCS § 607(g)]. 

Since 1916 Congress has charged NPS to "promote and regulate the use of the Federal areas known as national parks," "conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein," and "provide for [their] enjoyment [in a way that] will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." An Act To establish a National Park Service, 39 Stat 535, 16 USC § 1 [16 USCS § 1].  To make visits to national parks more enjoyable for the public, Congress authorized NPS to "grant privileges, leases, and permits for the use of land for the accommodation of visitors."  § 3, 39 Stat 535.  Such "privileges, leases, and permits" have become embodied in national parks concession contracts. 

The specific rules governing national parks concession contracts have changed over time.  In 1998, however, Congress enacted the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (1998 Act or Act), Pub L 105-391, 112 Stat 3497 (codified with certain exceptions in 16 U.S.C. §§ 5951 -5966, [16 USCS §§ 5951-5966])  establishing a new and comprehensive concession management program for national parks. The 1998 Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enact regulations implementing the Act's provisions, § 5965. 

NPS, to which the Secretary has delegated her authority under the 1998 Act, promptly began a rulemaking proceeding to implement the Act.  After notice and comment, final regulations were issued in April 2000.  65 Fed. Reg. 20630 (2000) (codified in 36 CFR pt. 51).  The regulations define the term "concession contract" as follows: "A concession contract (or contract) means a binding written agreement between the Director and a concessioner . . . .  Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 601 et seq. [41 USCS §§ 601 et seq.] (the Contract Disputes Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions." 3For ease of reference, throughout this opinion we will refer to the second sentence quoted in the text as § 51.3.36 CFR § 51.3 (2002).

 Through this provision NPS took a position with respect to a longstanding controversy with the Department of Interior's Board of Contract Appeals (IBCA).  Beginning in 1989, the IBCA ruled that NPS concession contracts were subject to the CDA, see R & R Enterprises, 89-2 B. C. A., P 21708, pp 109145-109147 (1989), and subsequent attempts by NPS to convince the IBCA otherwise proved unavailing, National  Park Concessions, Inc., 94-3 B. C. A., P 27104, pp 135096-135098 (1994). 

II 

Petitioner challenged the validity of § 51.3 in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Amfac Resorts, L. L. C. v. United States Dept. of Interior, 142 F. Supp. 2d 54, 80-82 (2001).The District Court upheld the regulation, applying the deference principle ofChevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984).  The court concluded that the CDA is ambiguous on whether it applies to concession contracts and found NPS' interpretation of the CDA reasonable. 142 F. Supp. 2d, at 80-82. 

 The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, albeit on different grounds. Amfac Resorts, L. L. C. v. United States Dept. of Interior, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 191, 282 F.3d 818, 834-835 (2002).  Recognizing that NPS "does not administer the [CDA], and thus may not have interpretative authority over its provisions," the court placed no reliance on Chevron but simply "agreed" with NPS' reading of the CDA, finding that reading consistent with both the CDA and the 1998 Act. 282 F.3d at 835.  We granted certiorari to consider whether the CDA applies to contracts between NPS and concessioners in the national parks. 537 U.S. 1018, 154 L. Ed. 2d 424, 123 S. Ct. 549 (2002).  Because petitioner has brought a facial challenge to the regulation and is not litigating any concrete dispute with NPS, we asked the parties to provide supplemental briefing on whether the case is ripe for judicial action.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 62. 

III 

 Ripeness is a justiciability doctrine designed "to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the  challenging parties." Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,387 U.S. 136, 148-149, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 87 S. Ct. 1507 (1967); accord,Ohio Forestry Ass'n v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 732-733, 140 L. Ed. 2d 921, 118 S. Ct. 1665 (1998).  The ripeness doctrine is "drawn both from Article III limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction,"Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc.,509 U.S. 43, 57, n. 18, 125 L. Ed. 2d 38, 113 S. Ct. 2485 (1993) (citations omitted), but, even in a case raising only prudential concerns, the question of ripeness may be considered on a court's own motion.  Ibid.(citingRegional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,419 U.S. 102, 138, 42 L. Ed. 2d 320, 95 S. Ct. 335 (1974)). 

 Determining whether administrative action is ripe for judicial review requires us to evaluate (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and (2) the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration. Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149, 18 L Ed 2d 681, 87 S Ct 1507.  "Absent [a statutory provision providing for immediate judicial review], a regulation is not ordinarily considered the type of agency action 'ripe' for judicial review under the [Administrative Procedure Act (APA)] until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions, and its factual components fleshed out, by some concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant's situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to harm him.  (The major exception, of course, is a substantive rule which as a practical matter requires the plaintiff to adjust his conduct immediately . . . .)" Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation,497 U.S. 871, 891, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695, 110 S. Ct. 3177 (1990).  Under the facts now before us, we conclude this case is not ripe. 

We turn first to the hardship inquiry.  The federal respondents concede that, because NPS has no delegated rulemaking authority under the CDA, the challenged portion of § 51.3 cannot be a legislative regulation with the force of law.  See Brief for Federal Respondents 15, n 6; Supplemental Brief for Federal Respondents 6.  They note, though, that "agencies may issue interpretive rules 'to advise the public of the agency's construction of the statutes and rules which  it administers,'" Brief for Federal Respondents 15, n 6 (quotingShalala v. Guernsey Memorial Hospital,514 U.S. 87, 99, 131 L. Ed. 2d 106, 115 S. Ct. 1232 (1995)) (emphasis added), and seek to characterize § 51.3 as such an interpretive rule. 

 We disagree.  Unlike inGuernsey Memorial Hospital, where the agency issuing the interpretative guideline was responsible for administering the relevant statutes and regulations, NPS is not empowered to administer the CDA.  Rather, the task of applying the CDA rests with agency contracting officers and boards of contract appeals, as well as the Federal Court of Claims, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and, ultimately, this Court.  Moreover, under the CDA, any authority regarding the proper arrangement of agency boards belongs to the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy.  See 41 U.S.C. § 607(h) [41 USCS § 607(h)] ("Pursuant to the authority conferred under the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act [41 U.S.C. § 401 et seq [41 USCS §§ 401 et seq.]], the Administrator is authorized and directed, as may be necessary or desirable to carry out the provisions of this chapter, to issue guidelines with respect to criteria for the establishment, functions, and procedures of the agency boards . . .").  Consequently, we consider § 51.3 to be nothing more than a "general statement of policy" designed to inform the public of NPS' views on the proper application of the CDA.  5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A) [5 USCS § 553(b)(3)(A)]. 

Viewed in this light, § 51.3 does not create "adverse effects of a strictly legal kind," which we have previously required for a showing of hardship. Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc., 523 U.S. at 733, 140 L Ed 2d 921, 118 S Ct 1665.  Just like the Forest Service plan at issue in Ohio Forestry, § 51.3"does not command anyone to do anything or to refrain from doing anything; [it] does not grant, withhold, or modify any formal legal license, power, or authority; [it] does not subject anyone to any civil or criminal liability; [and it] creates no legal rights or obligations." Ibid.

 Moreover, § 51.3 does not affect a concessioner's primary conduct. Toilet Goods Ass'n v. Gardner,387 U.S. 158, 164, 18 L Ed 2d 697, 87 S Ct 1520 (1967); Ohio Forestry Assn., supra, at 733-734, 140 L Ed 2d 921, 118 S Ct 1665.  Unlike the regulation at issue inAbbott Laboratories, which required drug manufacturers to change the labels, advertisements, and promotional materials they used in marketing prescription drugs on pain of criminal and civil penalties, see387 U.S., at 152-153, 18 L Ed 2d 681, 87 S Ct 1507, the regulation here leaves a concessioner free to conduct its business as it sees fit.  See alsoGardner v. Toilet Goods Ass'n  ,387 U.S. 167, 171, 18 L. Ed. 2d 704, 87 S. Ct. 1526 (1967) (regulations governing conditions for use of color additives in foods, drugs, and cosmetics were "self-executing" and had "an immediate and substantial impact upon the respondents"). 

We have previously found that challenges to regulations similar to § 51.3 were not ripe for lack of a showing of hardship. In Toilet Goods Assn., for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a regulation requiring producers of color additives to provide FDA employees with access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, and formulae. 387 U.S., at 161-162, 18 L Ed 2d 697, 87 S Ct 1520.  We concluded the case was not ripe for judicial review because the impact of the regulation could not "be said to be felt immediately by those subject to it in conducting their day-to-day affairs" and "no irremediably adverse consequences flowed from requiring a later challenge." Id., at 164, 18 L Ed 2d 697, 87 S Ct 1520.  Indeed, the FDA regulation was more onerous than § 51.3 because failure to comply with it resulted in the suspension of the producer's certification and, consequently, could affect production. id., at 165, and n 2, 18 L Ed 2d 697, 87 S Ct 1520.  Here, by contrast, concessioners suffer no practical harm as a result of § 51.3.  All the regulation does is announce the position NPS will take with respect to disputes arising out of concession contracts.  While it informs the public of NPS' view that concessioners are not entitled to take advantage of the provisions of the CDA, nothing in the  regulation prevents concessioners from following the procedures set forth in the CDA once a dispute over a concession contract actually arises.  And it appears that, notwithstanding § 51.3, the IBCA has been quite willing to apply the CDA to certain concession contracts.  Watch Hill Concessions, Inc., 01-1 B. C. A.,  P 31298, pp 154520-154521 (IBCA 2001) (concluding that concession contract was subject to the CDA despite the contrary language in § 51.3). 

Petitioner contends that delaying judicial resolution of this issue will result in real harm because the applicability vel non of the CDA is one of the factors a concessioner takes into account when preparing its bid for NPS concession contracts.  See Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 4-6.  Petitioner's argument appears to be that mere uncertainty as to the validity of a legal rule constitutes a hardship for purposes of the ripeness analysis.  We are not persuaded.  If we were to follow petitioner's logic, courts would soon be overwhelmed with requests for what essentially would be advisory opinions because most business transactions could be priced more accurately if even a small portion of existing legal uncertainties were resolved. 4Petitioner notes that its complaint challenged not only the regulation but also two specific prospectuses issued by NPS in late 2000.  Thus, petitioner argues, even if the first challenge is not ripe, the latter two are reviewable under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1) [28 USCS § 1491(b)(1)].  See Supplemental Brief for Petitioner 6-8.  Petitioner did not seek certiorari review on these issues; accordingly, we decline to consider them.  See this Court's Rule 14.1(a);Yee v. Escondido,503 U.S. 519, 535-536, 118 L. Ed. 2d 153, 112 S. Ct. 1522 (1992).  Similarly, Justice Breyer's reliance on the Tucker Act to show that the hardship requirement ofAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner,387 U.S. 136, 18 L. Ed. 2d 681, 87 S. Ct. 1507 (1967), has been satisfied, see post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 1032-1033 (dissenting opinion), is misplaced.  The fact that one "congressional statute" authorizes "immediate judicial relief from [certain types of] agency determinations," ibid., says nothing about whether "immediate judicial review" is advisable for challenges brought against other types of agency actions based on a different statute. In short, petitioner has failed  to demonstrate  that deferring judicial review will result in real hardship. 

 We consider next whether the issue in this case is fit for review.  Although the question presented here is "a purely legal one" and § 51.3 constitutes "final agency action" within the meaning of § 10 of the APA, 5 USC § 704 [5 USCS § 704],Abbott Laboratories, supra, at 149, 18 L Ed 2d 681, 87 S Ct 1507, we nevertheless believe that further factual development would "significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented,"Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc.,438 U.S. 59, 82, 57 L. Ed. 2d 595, 98 S. Ct. 2620 (1978); accord,Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc., 523 U.S. at 736-737, 140 L Ed 2d 921, 118 S Ct 1665;Toilet Goods Ass'n., supra, at 163, 18 L Ed 2d 697, 87 S Ct 1520.  While the federal respondents generally argue that NPS was correct to conclude that the CDA does not cover concession contracts, they acknowledge that certain types of concession contracts might come under the broad language of the CDA.  Brief for Federal Respondents 33-34.  Similarly, while petitioner and respondent Xanterra Parks & Resorts, LLC, present a facial challenge to § 51.3, both rely on specific characteristics of certain types of concession contracts to support their positions.  See Brief for Petitioner 21-23, 36; Brief for Respondent Xanterra Parks & Resorts, LLC, 20, 22.  In light of the foregoing, we conclude that judicial resolution of the question presented here should await a concrete dispute about a particular concession contract. * * * 

For the reasons stated above, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it addressed the validity of § 51.3 and remand with instructions to dismiss the case with respect to this issue. 

It is so ordered.  


Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. 

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA or Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave annually for any of several reasons, including the onset of a "serious health condition" in an employee's spouse, child, or parent.  107 Stat 9, 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C) [29 USCS § 2612(a)(1)(C)]. The Act creates a private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money damages "against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," § 2617(a)(2), should that employer "interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise of" FMLA rights, § 2615(a)(1).  We hold that employees of the State of Nevada may recover money damages in the event of the State's failure to comply with the family-care provision of the Act. 

Petitioners include the Nevada Department of Human Resources (Department) and two of its officers.  Respondent William Hibbs (hereinafter respondent) worked for the Department's Welfare Division.  In April and May 1997, he sought leave under the FMLA to care for his ailing wife, who was recovering from a car accident and neck surgery.  The Department granted his request for the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave and authorized him to use the leave intermittently as needed between May and December 1997.  Respondent did so until August 5, 1997, after which he did not return to work.  In October 1997, the Department informed respondent that he had exhausted his FMLA leave, that no further leave would be granted, and that he must report to work by November 12, 1997.  Respondent failed to do so and was terminated. 

Respondent sued petitioners in the United States District Court seeking damages and injunctive and declaratory relief for, inter alia, violations of 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1)(C) [29 USCS § 2612(a)(1)(C)]. The District Court awarded petitioners summary judgment on the grounds that the FMLA claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent's Fourteenth Amendment rights had not been violated.  Respondent appealed, and the United States intervened under 28 USC § 2403 [28 USCS § 2403] to defend the validity of the FMLA's application to the States.  The Ninth Circuit reversed. 273 F.3d 844 (2001). 

We granted certiorari, 536 US 938, 153 L Ed 2d 802, 122 S Ct 2618 (2002), to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether an individual may sue a State for money damages in federal court for violation of § 2612(a)(1)(C).  CompareKazmier v.  Widmann, 225 F.3d 519, 526, 529 (CA5 2000), with273 F.3d 844 (case below). 

 For over a century now, we have made clear that the Constitution does not provide for federal jurisdiction over suits against nonconsenting States. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,531 U.S. 356, 363, 148 L. Ed. 2d 866, 121 S. Ct. 955 (2001);Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 72-73,145 L. Ed. 2d 522, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000);College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 669-670, 144 L. Ed. 2d 605, 119 S. Ct. 2219 (1999);Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,517 U.S. 44, 54, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996);Hans v. Louisiana,134 U.S. 1, 15, 33 L. Ed. 842, 10 S. Ct. 504 (1890). 

Congress may, however, abrogate such immunity in federal court if it makes its intention to abrogate unmistakably clear in the language of the statute and acts pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. SeeGarrett, supra, at 363, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955;Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,501 U.S. 775, 786, 115 L. Ed. 2d 686, 111 S. Ct. 2578 (1991) (citingDellmuth v. Muth,491 U.S. 223, 228, 105 L. Ed. 2d 181, 109 S. Ct. 2397 (1989)).  The clarity of Congress' intent here is not fairly debatable.  The Act enables employees to seek damages "against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," 29 U.S.C. § 2617(a)(2) [29 USCS § 2617(a)(2)], and Congress has defined "public agency" to include both "the government of a State or political subdivision thereof" and "any agency of . . . a State, or a political subdivision of a State," §§ 203(x), 2611(4)(A)(iii).  We held in Kimel that, by using identical language in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat 602, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. [29 USCS §§ 621 et seq.], Congress satisfied the clear statement rule of Dellmuth.528 U.S., at 73-78, 105 L Ed 2d 181, 109 S Ct 2397.  This case turns, then,  on whether Congress acted within its constitutional authority when it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave provision. 

 In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied on two of the powers vested in it by the Constitution: its Article I commerce power and its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment's guarantees. 1Compare 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b)(1) [29 USCS § 2601(b)(1)] ("It is the purpose of this Act . . . to balance the demands of the workplace with the needs of families, to promote the stability and economic security of families, and to promote national interests in preserving family integrity") with § 2601(b)(5) ("to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men, pursuant to [the Equal Protection C]lause") and § 2601(b)(4) ("to accomplish [the Act's other purposes] in a manner that, consistent with the Equal Protection Clause . . ., minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex").  See also S. Rep. No. 103-3, p 16 (1993) (the FMLA "is based not only on the Commerce Clause, but also on the guarantees of equal protection and due process embodied in the 14th Amendment"); H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, p 29 (1993) (same).Congress may not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity pursuant to its Article I power over commerce. Seminole Tribe, supra.Congress may, however, abrogate States' sovereign immunity through a valid exercise of its § 5 power, for "the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,427 U.S. 445, 456, 49 L. Ed. 2d 614, 96 S. Ct. 2666 (1976) (citation omitted).  See alsoGarrett, supra, at 364, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955;Kimel, supra, at 80, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631. 

 Two provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment are relevant  here: Section 5 grants Congress the power "to enforce" the substantive guarantees of § 1--among them, equal protection of the laws--by enacting "appropriate legislation." Congress may, in the exercise of its § 5 power, do more than simply proscribe conduct that we have held unconstitutional.  "'Congress' power "to enforce" the Amendment includes the authority both to remedy and to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text.'" Garrett, supra, at 365, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955 (quotingKimel, supra, at 81, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631);City of Boerne v. Flores,521 U.S. 507, 536, 138 L. Ed. 2d 624, 117 S. Ct. 2157 (1997);Katzenbach v. Morgan,384 U.S. 641, 658, 16 L. Ed. 2d 828, 86 S. Ct. 1717 (1966).  In other words, Congress may enact so-called prophylactic  legislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct, in order to prevent and deter unconstitutional conduct. 

City of Boerne also confirmed, however, that it falls to this Court, not Congress, to define the substance of constitutional guarantees. 521 U.S., at 519-524, 138 L Ed 2d 624, 117 S Ct 2157."The ultimate interpretation and determination of the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive meaning remains the province of the Judicial Branch." Kimel, 528 U.S., at 81, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631.  Section 5 legislation reaching beyond the scope of § 1's actual guarantees must be an appropriate remedy for identified constitutional violations, not "an attempt to substantively redefine the States' legal obligations." Id., at 88, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631.  We distinguish appropriate prophylactic legislation from "substantive redefinition of theFourteenth Amendment right at issue,"id., at 81, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631, by applying the test set forth in City of Boerne: Valid § 5 legislation must exhibit "congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end." 521 US, at 520, 138 L Ed 2d 624, 117 S Ct 2157. 

 The FMLA aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace. 2The text of the Act makes this clear.  Congress found that, "due to the nature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives of women more than it affects the working lives of men." 29 U.S.C. § 2601(a)(5) [29 USCS § 2601(a)(5)].  In response to this finding, Congress sought "to accomplish the [Act's other] purposes . . . in a manner that . . . minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sex by ensuring generally that leave is available . . . on a gender-neutral basis[,] and to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity for women and men . . . ." §§ 2601(b)(4) and (5) (emphasis added). We have held that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are subject to heightened scrutiny.  See, e.g.,Craig v. Boren,429 U.S. 190, 197-199, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397, 97 S. Ct. 451 (1976).  For a gender-based classification to withstand such scrutiny, it must "serve important governmental objectives," and "the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." United  States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533, 135 L. Ed. 2d 735, 116 S. Ct. 2264 (1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The State's justification for such a classification "must not rely on overbroad generalizations about the different  talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females." Ibid. We now inquire whether Congress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States in this area. 

The history of the many state laws limiting women's employment opportunities is chronicled in--and, until relatively recently, was sanctioned by--this Court's own opinions.  For example, inBradwell v. State,16 Wall. 130, 21 L Ed 442 (1873) (Illinois), and Goesaert v. Cleary,335 U.S. 464, 466, 93 L. Ed. 163, 69 S. Ct. 198 (1948) (Michigan), the Court upheld state laws prohibiting women from practicing law and tending bar, respectively.  State laws frequently subjected women to distinctive restrictions, terms, conditions, and benefits for those jobs they could take.  InMuller v. Oregon,208 U.S. 412, 419, n. 1, 52 L. Ed. 551, 28 S. Ct. 324 (1908), for example, this Court approved a state law limiting the hours that women could work for wages, and observed that 19 States had such laws at the time.  Such laws were based on the related beliefs that (1) woman is, and should remain, "the center of home and family life,"Hoyt v. Florida,368 U.S. 57, 62, 7 L. Ed. 2d 118, 82 S. Ct. 159 (1961), and (2) "a proper discharge of [a woman's] maternal functions--having in view not merely her own health, but the well-being of the race--justifies legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the passion of man,"Muller, supra, at 422, 52 L Ed 551, 28 S Ct 324..  Until our decision inReed v. Reed,404 U.S. 71, 30 L. Ed. 2d 225, 92 S. Ct. 251 (1971), "it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from women opportunities accorded men so long as any 'basis in reason'"--such as the above beliefs--"could be conceived for the discrimination." Virginia, supra, at 531, 135 L Ed 2d 735, 116 S Ct 2264 (quotingGoesaert, supra, at 467, 93 L Ed 163, 69 S Ct 198). 

Congress responded to this history of discrimination by abrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat 255, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a) [42 USCS § 2000e-2(a)],  and we sustained this abrogation inFitzpatrick, supra. But state gender discrimination did not cease.  "It can hardly be doubted that . . . women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination . . . in the job market." Frontiero v. Richardson,411 U.S. 677, 686, 36 L. Ed. 2d 583, 93 S. Ct. 1764 (1973).  According to evidence that was before Congress when it enacted the FMLA, States continue to rely on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits.  Reliance on such stereotypes cannot justify the States' gender discrimination in this area. Virginia, supra, at 533, 135 L Ed 2d 735, 116 S Ct 2264.  The long and extensive history of sex discrimination prompted us to hold that measures that differentiate on the basis of gender warrant heightened scrutiny; here, as inFitzpatrick, the persistence of such unconstitutional discrimination by the States justifies Congress' passage of prophylactic § 5 legislation. 

As the FMLA's legislative record reflects, a 1990 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) survey stated that 37 percent of surveyed private-sector employees were covered by maternity leave policies, while only 18 percent were covered by paternity leave policies.   S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp 14-15 (1993).  The corresponding numbers from a similar BLS survey the previous year were 33 percent and 16 percent, respectively.  Ibid. While these data show an increase in the percentage of employees eligible for such leave, they also show a widening of the gender gap during the same period.  Thus, stereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of family duties remained firmly rooted, and employers' reliance on them in establishing discriminatory leave policies remained widespread. 3While this and other material described leave policies in the private sector, a 50-state survey also before Congress demonstrated that "the proportion and construction of leave policies available to public sector employees differs little from those offered private sector employees." The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1986) (hereinafter Joint Hearing) (statement of Meryl Frank, Director of the Yale Bush Center Infant Care Leave Project).  See also id., at 29-30.

Congress also heard testimony that "parental leave for fathers . . . is rare.  Even . . . where child-care leave policies do exist, men, both in the public and private sectors, receive notoriously discriminatory treatment in their requests for such leave." Id., at 147 (Washington Council of Lawyers) (emphasis added).  Many States offered women extended "maternity" leave that far exceeded the typical 4- to 8-week period of physical disability due to pregnancy and childbirth, 4See, e.g., id., at 16 (six weeks is the medically recommended pregnancy disability leave period); H. R. Rep. No. 101-28, pt. 1, p 30 (1989) (referring to Pregnancy Discrimination Act legislative history establishing four to eight weeks as the medical recovery period for a normal childbirth). but very few States granted men a parallel benefit: Fifteen States provided women up to one year of extended maternity leave, while only four provided men with the same.  M. Lord & M. King, The State Reference Guide to Work-Family Programs for State Employees 30 (1991).  This and other differential leave policies were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women, but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work. 5For example, state employers' collective-bargaining agreements often granted extended "maternity" leave of six months to a year to women only.  Gerald McEntee, President of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO testified that "the vast majority of our contracts, even though we look upon them with great pride, really cover essentially maternity leave, and not paternity leave." The Parental and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Hearings before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p 385 (1987) (hereinafter 1987 Senate Labor Hearings).  In addition, state leave laws often specified that catchall leave-without-pay provisions could be used for extended maternity leave, but did not authorize such leave for paternity purposes.  See, e.g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Joint Hearing before the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-5 (1987) (Rep. Gary Ackerman recounted suffering expressly sex-based denial of unpaid leave of absence where benefit was ostensibly available for "child care leave"). Evidence pertaining to parenting leave is relevant here because state discrimination in the provision of both types of benefits is based on the same gender stereotype: that women's family duties trump those of the workplace. Justice Kennedy's dissent (hereinafter the dissent) ignores this common foundation that, as Congress found, has historically produced discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women.  See post, at 538 U.S. 721, 155 L. Ed. 2d 953, 975, 123 S. Ct. 1972.  Consideration of such evidence does not, as the dissent contends, expand our § 5 inquiry to include "general gender-based stereotypes in employment." Ibid. (emphasis added).  To the contrary, because parenting and family leave address very similar situations in which work and family responsibilities conflict, they implicate the same stereotypes.

    Finally, Congress had evidence that, even where state laws and policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied in discriminatory ways.  It was aware of the "serious problems with the discretionary nature of family leave," because when "the authority to grant leave and to arrange the length of that leave rests with individual supervisors," it leaves "employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment." H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp 10-11 (1993).  Testimony supported that conclusion, explaining that "the lack of uniform parental and medical leave policies in the work place has created an environment where [sex] discrimination is rampant." 1987 Senate Labor Hearings, pt. 2, at 170 (testimony of Peggy Montes, Mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs, City of Chicago). 

In spite of all of the above evidence, Justice Kennedy argues in dissent that Congress' passage of the FMLA was unnecessary because "the States appear to have been ahead of Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits," post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 977, and points to Nevada's leave policies in particular, post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 981.  However, it was only "since Federal family leave legislation was first introduced"  that the States had even "begun to consider similar family leave initiatives." S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 20; see also S. Rep. No. 102-68,  p 77 (1991) (minority views of Sen. Durenberger) ("So few states have elected to enact similar legislation at the state level"). 

Furthermore, the dissent's statement that some States "had adopted some form of family-care leave" before the FMLA's enactment, post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 977, glosses over important shortcomings of some state policies.  First, seven States had childcare leave provisions that applied to women only.  Indeed, Massachusetts required that notice of its leave provisions be posted only in "establishments in which females are employed." 6Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 149, § 105D (West 1997) (providing leave to "female employees" for childbirth or adoption); see also 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002) (pregnancy disability leave only); Iowa Code § 216.6(2) (2000) (former § 601A.6(2)) (same); Kan. Regs. 21-32-6(d) (2003) ("a reasonable period" of maternity leave for female employees only); N. H. Stat. Ann. § 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Supp. 2000) (pregnancy disability leave only); La. Stat. Ann. § 23:1008(A)(2) (West Supp. 1993) (repealed 1997) (4-month maternity leave for female employees only); Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-21-408(a) (1998) (same). The dissent asserts that four of these schemes--those of Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, and New Hampshire--concern "pregnancy disability leave only." Post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 978.  But Louisiana provided women with four months of such leave, which far exceeds the medically recommended pregnancy disability leave period of six weeks.  See n 4, supra. This gender-discriminatory policy is not attributable to any different physical needs of men and women, but rather to the invalid stereotypes that Congress sought to counter through the FMLA.  See supra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 965. These laws reinforced the very stereotypes that Congress sought to remedy through the FMLA.  Second, 12 States provided their employees no family leave, beyond an initial childbirth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill child or  family member. 7See 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29, § 5116 (1997); Iowa Code § 216.6(2) (2000); Kan. Regs. 21-32-6 (2003); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 337.015 (Michie 2001); La. Stat. Ann. § 23:1008(A)(2) (West Supp. 1993); Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 149, § 105(D) (West 1997); Mo. Rev. Stat. § 105.271 (2000); N. H. Stat. Ann. § 354- A:7(VI)(b) (Supp. 2000); N. Y. Lab. Law § 201-c (West 2002); Tenn. Code Ann. § 4-21-408(a) (1998); U. S. Dept. of Labor, Women's Bureau, State Maternity/Family Leave Law, p 12 (June 1993) (citing a Virginia personnel policy). Third, many States provided  no statutorily guaranteed right to family leave, offering instead only voluntary or discretionary leave programs.  Three States left the amount of leave time primarily in employers' hands. 8See 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Kan. Regs. 21-32-6 (2003); N. H. Stat. Ann. § 354-A:7(VI)(b) (Supp. 2000).  Oklahoma offered only a system by which employees could voluntarily donate leave time for colleagues' family emergencies.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 74, § 840-2.22 (historical note) (West 2002).Congress could reasonably conclude that such discretionary family-leave programs would do little to combat the stereotypes about the roles of male and female employees that Congress sought to eliminate.  Finally, four States provided leave only through administrative regulations or personnel policies, which Congress could reasonably conclude offered significantly less firm protection than a federal law. 9See 3 Colo. Code Regs. § 708-1, Rule 80.8 (2002); Kan. Regs. 21-32-6 (2003); Wis. Admin. Code ch. DWD 225 (1997) (former ch. ILHR 225); State Maternity/Family Leave Law, supra, at 12 (Virginia). Against the above backdrop of limited state leave policies, no matter how generous petitioner's own may have been, see post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 981 (the dissent), Congress was justified in enacting the FMLA as remedial legislation. 10Contrary to the dissent's belief, we do not hold that Congress may "abrogate state immunity from private suits whenever the State's social benefits program is not enshrined in the statutory code and provides employers with discretion," post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 979, or when a State does not confer social benefits "as generous or extensive as Congress would later deem appropriate," ibid. The dissent misunderstands the purpose of the FMLA's family leave provision.  The FMLA is not a "substantive entitlement program," post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 980; Congress did not create a particular leave policy for its own sake.  See infra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 969-970.  Rather, Congress sought to adjust family leave policies in order to eliminate their reliance on and perpetuation of invalid stereotypes, and thereby dismantle persisting gender-based barriers to the hiring, retention, and promotion of women in the workplace. In pursuing that goal, for the reasons discussed above, supra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 966-967, Congress reasonably concluded that state leave laws and practices should be brought within the Act.

  In sum, the States' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justify the enactment of prophylactic § 5 legislation. 11Given the extent and specificity of the above record of unconstitutional state conduct, it is difficult to understand the dissent's accusation that we rely on "a simple recitation of a general history of employment discrimination against women." Post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 975.  As we stated above, our holding rests on congressional findings that, at the time the FMLA was enacted, States "relied on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits." Supra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 964 (emphasis added).  See supra, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 964-966.

 We reached the opposite conclusion in Garrett and Kimel.In those cases, the § 5 legislation under review responded to a purported tendency  of state officials to make age- or disability-based distinctions.  Under our equal protection case law, discrimination on the basis of such characteristics is not judged under a heightened review standard, and passes muster if there is "a rational basis for doing so at a class-based level, even if it 'is probably not true' that those reasons are valid in the majority of cases." Kimel, 528 U.S., at 86, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631 (quotingGregory v. Ashcroft,501 U.S. 452, 473, 115 L. Ed. 2d 410, 111 S. Ct. 2395 (1991)).  See alsoGarrett, 531 U.S., at 367, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955 ("States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational").  Thus, in order to impugn the constitutionality of state discrimination against the disabled or the elderly, Congress must identify, not just the existence of age- or disability-based state decisions, but a "widespread pattern" of irrational reliance on such criteria. Kimel, supra, at 90, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631.We found no such showing with respect to the ADEA and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( ADA). Kimel, supra, at 89, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631;Garrett, supra, at 368, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955. 

 Here, however, Congress directed its attention to state gender discrimination, which triggers a heightened level of scrutiny.  See, e.g.,Craig,429 U.S., at 197-199, 50 L Ed 2d 397, 97 S Ct 451.  Because the standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of a gender-based classification is more difficult to meet than our rational-basis test--it must "serve important governmental objectives" and be "substantially related to the achievement of those objectives,"Virginia, 518 U.S., at 533, 135 L Ed 2d 735, 116 S Ct 2264--it was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations. Congress was similarly successful inSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach,383 U.S. 301, 308, 15 L. Ed. 2d 769, 86 S. Ct. 803803 (1966), where we upheld the Voting Rights Act of 1965: Because racial classifications are presumptively invalid, most of the States' acts of race discrimination violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

 The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLA is significant.  Congress determined: "Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second.  This prevailing ideology about women's roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be." Joint Hearing 100.

Stereotypes about women's domestic roles are reinforced by parallel stereotypes presuming a lack of domestic responsibilities for men.  Because employers continued to regard the family as the woman's domain, they often denied men similar accommodations or discouraged them from taking leave.  These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, and fostered employers' stereotypical views about women's commitment to work and their value as employees.  Those perceptions, in turn, Congress reasoned, lead to subtle discrimination that may be  difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis. 

 We believe that Congress' chosen remedy, the family-care leave provision of the FMLA, is "congruent and proportional to the targeted violation,"Garrett, supra, at 374, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955. Congress had already tried unsuccessfully to address this problem through Title VII and the amendment of Title VII by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(k) [42 USCS § 2000e(k)].  Here, as inKatzenbach, supra,Congress again confronted a "difficult and intractable problem,"Kimel, supra, at 88, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631, where previous legislative attempts had failed.  SeeKatzenbach, supra, at 313, 15 L Ed 2d 769, 86 S Ct 803 (upholding the Voting Rights Act).  Such problems may justify added prophylactic measures in response. Kimel, supra, at 88, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631. 

By creating an across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees, Congress sought to ensure that family-care leave would no longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female employees, and that employers could not evade leave obligations simply by hiring men.  By setting a minimum standard of family leave for all eligible employees, irrespective of gender, the FMLA attacks the formerly state-sanctioned stereotype that only women are responsible for family caregiving, thereby reducing employers' incentives to engage in discrimination by basing hiring and promotion decisions on stereotypes. 

 The dissent characterizes the FMLA as a "substantive entitlement program" rather than a remedial statute because it establishes a floor of 12 weeks' leave. Post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 980.  In the dissent's view, in the face of evidence of gender-based discrimination by the States in the provision of leave benefits, Congress could do no more in exercising its § 5 power than simply proscribe such discrimination.  But this position cannot be squared with our recognition that Congress "is not confined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrots the precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment," but may prohibit "a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment's text." Kimel, supra, at 81, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631.  For example, this Court has upheld certain prophylactic provisions of the Voting Rights Act as valid exercises of Congress' § 5 power, including the literacy test ban and preclearance requirements for changes in States' voting procedures.  See, e.g.,Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 16 L. Ed. 2d 828, 86 S. Ct. 1717 (1966);Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 27 L. Ed. 2d 272, 91 S. Ct. 260 (1970);South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra.

Indeed, in light of the evidence before Congress, a statute mirroring Title VII, that simply mandated gender equality in the administration of leave benefits, would not have achieved Congress' remedial object.  Such a law would allow States to provide for no family leave at all.  Where "two-thirds of the nonprofessional caregivers for older, chronically ill, or disabled persons are working women," H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 1, p 24 (1993); S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 7, and state practices continue to reinforce the stereotype of women as caregivers, such a policy  would exclude far more women than men from the workplace. 

 Unlike the statutes at issue inCity of Boerne,Kimel, andGarrett, which applied broadly to every aspect of state employers' operations, the FMLA is narrowly targeted at the fault line between work and family--precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest--and affects only one aspect of the employment relationship.  CompareRagsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 91, 152 L. Ed. 2d 167, 122 S. Ct. 1155 (2002) (discussing the "important limitations of the [FMLA's] remedial scheme"), withCity of Boerne, 521 U.S., at 532, 138 L Ed 2d 624, 117 S Ct 2157 (the "sweeping coverage" of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993);Kimel, 528 U.S., at 91, 145 L Ed 2d 522, 120 S Ct 631 ("the indiscriminate scope of the [ADEA's] substantive requirements"); andGarrett, 531 U.S., at 361, 148 L Ed 2d 866, 121 S Ct 955 (the ADA prohibits disability discrimination "in regard to [any] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment" (internal quotation marks omitted)). 

 We also find significant the many other limitations that Congress placed on the scope of this measure.  SeeFlorida Prepaid, 527 U.S., at 647, , 144 L Ed 2d 575, 119 S Ct 2199 ("Where 'a congressional enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action in an effort to remedy or to prevent unconstitutional state action, limitations of this kind tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate under § 5'" (quotingCity of Boerne, supra, at 532-533, 138 L Ed 2d 624, 117 S Ct 2157)).  The FMLA requires only unpaid leave, 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1) [29 USCS § 2612(a)(1)], and applies only to employees who have worked for the employer for at least one year and provided 1,250 hours of service within the last 12 months, § 2611(2)(A).  Employees in high-ranking or sensitive positions are simply ineligible for FMLA leave; of particular importance to the States, the FMLA expressly excludes from coverage state elected officials, their staffs, and appointed policymakers. §§ 2611(2)(B)(i) and (3), 203(e)(2)(C).  Employees must give advance notice of foreseeable leave, § 2612(e), and employers may require certification by a health care provider of the need for leave, § 2613.  In choosing 12 weeks as the appropriate leave floor, Congress chose "a middle ground, a period long enough to serve 'the needs of families' but not so long that it would upset 'the legitimate interests of employers.'" Ragsdale, supra, at 94, 152 L Ed 2d 167, 122 S Ct 1155 (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 2601(b) [29 USCS § 2601(b)]). 12Congress established 12 weeks as a floor, thus leaving States free to provide their employees with more family leave time if they so choose.  See 29 U.S.C. § 2651(b) [29 USCS § 2651(b)] ("Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to supersede any provision of any State or local law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than the rights established under this Act or any amendment made by this Act").  The dissent faults Congress for giving States this choice, arguing that the FMLA's terms do not bar States from granting more family leave time to women than to men.  Post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 981-982.  But Justice Kennedy effectively counters his own argument in his very next breath, recognizing that such gender-based discrimination would "run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VII." Post, at 155 L Ed 2d, at 981.  In crafting new legislation to remedy unconstitutional State conduct, Congress may certainly rely on and take account of existing laws.  Indeed, Congress expressly did so here.  See 29 U.S.C. § 2651(a) [29 USCS § 2651(a)] ("Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shall be construed to modify or affect any Federal or State law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of . . . sex . . ."). Moreover, the cause  of action under  the FMLA is a restricted one: The damages recoverable are strictly defined and measured by actual monetary losses, §§ 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), and the accrual period for backpay is limited by the Act's 2-year statute of limitations (extended to three years only for willful violations), §§ 2617(c) (1) and (2). 

 For the above reasons, we conclude that § 2612(a)(1)(C) is congruent and proportional to its remedial object, and can "be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior." City of Boerne, supra, at 532, 138 L Ed 2d 624, 117 S Ct 2157. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.  


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 These cases present the question whether a panel of the Court of Appeals consisting of two Article III judges and one Article IV judge had the authority to decide petitioners' appeals.  We conclude it did not, and we therefore vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals. 

I 

Petitioners are residents of the island of Guam, which has been a possession of the United States since the end of the Spanish-American War. 1See Treaty of Paris, Art. II, 30 Stat 1755 (1899). The Navy administered the island, except for the period of Japanese occupation during World War II, until Congress established Guam as an unincorporated Territory with the passage of the Organic Act of Guam in 1950. 264 Stat 384.  See generally A. Leibowitz, Defining Status: A Comprehensive Analysis of United States Territorial Relations 313, 323 (1989). Pursuant to Congress' authority under Article IV, § 3, of the Constitution to "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging  to the United States," the Organic Act of Guam created a territorial court, the District Court of Guam, and vested it with subject-matter jurisdiction over causes arising under both federal law and local law. 3See Organic Act of Guam § 22, 64 Stat 389, 48 USC § 1424 [48 USCS § 1424].  "The 'District Court of Guam' rather than 'United States District Court of Guam' was chosen as the court's title, since it was created under Art. IV, § 3, of the Federal Constitution rather than under Art. III, and since § 22 vested the court with original jurisdiction to decide both local and federal-question matters." Guam v. Olsen,431 U.S. 195, 196, n. 1, 52 L. Ed. 2d 250, 97 S. Ct. 1774 (1977) (citing S. Rep. No. 2109, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., p 12 (1950)).  The Guam Legislature was authorized as well to create local courts and transfer to them jurisdiction over certain cases that otherwise could be heard by the District Court of Guam.  SeeOlsen, 431 U.S., at 200-201, 52 L Ed 2d 250, 97 S Ct 1774 (citingAgana Bay Dev. Co. (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Supreme Court of Guam, 529 F.2d 952, 959 (CA9 1976) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)). Petitioners were tried before a jury, convicted, and sentenced in the District Court of Guam to lengthy prison terms for federal narcotics offenses.  Petitioners do not dispute that court's jurisdiction to conduct their criminal trial and enter judgments of conviction. 

 As authorized by statute, 4Title 28 U.S.C. § 1294(4) [28 USCS § 1294(4)] provides: "Appeals from reviewable decisions of the district and territorial courts shall be taken to the courts of appeals as follows: "(4) From the District Court of Guam, to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit." petitioners appealed their convictions  to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  The panel convened to hear their appeals included the Chief Judge and a Senior Circuit Judge of the Ninth Circuit, both of whom are, of course, life-tenured Article III judges who serve during "good Behaviour" for compensation that may not be diminished while in office.  U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1.  The third member of the panel was the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  That court is not an Article III court but an Article IV territorial court with subject-matter jurisdiction substantially similar  to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Guam. 5 "The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands shall have the jurisdiction of a District Court of the United States, including, but not limited to, the diversity jurisdiction provided for in section 1332 of title 28 and that of a bankruptcy court of the United States. "The district court shall have original jurisdiction in all causes in the Northern Mariana Islands not described in subsection (a) of this section jurisdiction over which is not vested by the Constitution or laws of the Northern Mariana Islands in a court or courts of the Northern Mariana Islands." 48 USC § 1822 [48 USCS § 1822].  The text of the statute closely follows the corresponding provisions of the Organic Act of Guam. See S. Rep. No. 95-475, p 3 (1997). The Chief Judge of the District for the Northern Mariana Islands, unlike an Article III judge, is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a term of 10 years, "unless sooner removed by the President for cause." 648 U.S.C. § 1821(b)(1) [48 USCS § 1821(b)(1)].

The highly unusual presence of a non-Article III judge as a member of the Ninth Circuit panel occurred during special sittings in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  When the Court of Appeals heard arguments in Guam, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit invited the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to participate.  A judge of the District Court of Guam was similarly invited to participate in appeals heard while the Ninth Circuit sat in the Northern Mariana Islands. 

The panel affirmed petitioners' convictions without dissent. 284 F.3d 1086 (2002).  Neither Nguyen nor Phan objected to the composition of the panel before the cases were submitted for decision; neither petitioner sought rehearing after the Court of Appeals rendered judgment to challenge the panel's authority to decide their appeals.  Each did, however, file a petition for certiorari raising the question whether the judgment of the Court of Appeals is invalid because of the participation of a non-Article III judge on the panel.  In accordance with this Court's Rule 10(a), we granted the writ,537 U.S. 999, 537 U.S. 999, 154 L. Ed. 2d 394, 123 S. Ct. 512 (2002), to determine whether  the Court of Appeals had "so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings as to call for an exercise of this Court's supervisory power." Pet. for Cert. in No. 01-10873, p 6; Pet. for Cert. in No. 02-5034, p 5.  For the following reasons, we find these to be appropriate cases for the exercise of that power. 

 II 

 We begin with the congressional  grant of authority permitting, in certain circumstances, the designation of district judges to serve on the courts of appeals.  In relevant part, the designation statute authorizes the chief judge of a circuit to assign "one or more district judges within the circuit" to sit on the court of appeals "whenever the business of that court so requires." 28 U.S.C. § 292(a) [28 USCS § 292(a)].  Section 292(a) itself does not explicitly define the "district judges" who may be assigned to the court of appeals. However, as other provisions of law make perfectly clear, judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are not "district judges" within the meaning of § 292(a). 

Outside of § 292(a), Title 28 contains several particularly instructive provisions.  The term "district court" as used throughout Title 28 is defined to mean a "'court of the United States'" that is "constituted by chapter five of this title." § 451.  Chapter 5 of Title 28 in turn creates a "United States District Court" for each judicial district. § 132(a)("There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district").  And "district judges" are established as the members of those courts.  § 132(b)("Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service").  The judicial districts constituted by Chapter 5 are then exhaustively enumerated.  § 133(a)("The President shall appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, district judges for the several judicial  districts, as follows [listing districts]").  Lastly, Chapter 5 describes "district judges" as holding office "during good behavior." § 134(a). 

Taking these provisions together, § 292(a) cannot be read to permit the designation to the court of appeals of a judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.  Significantly, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is not one of the courts constituted by Chapter 5 of Title 28, nor is that court even mentioned within Chapter 5. 7The District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands is instead established in Chapter 17 of Title 48 ("Territories and Insular Possessions").  See § 1821. See § 133(a).  Because the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands are appointed for a term of years and may be removed by the President for cause, they also do not satisfy the command for district judges within the meaning of Title 28 to hold office during good behavior. § 134(a). 

The Solicitor General agrees these statutory provisions are best read together as not permitting the Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands to sit by designation on the Ninth Circuit.  The Government maintains, however, that the erroneous designation in these cases was not plainly impermissible because Title 28 does not expressly forbid it or explicitly define the term "district judge" separately from the term "district court." This contention requires an excessively strained interpretation of the statute.  To be sure, a literal reading of the words "district judges" in isolation from the rest of the statute might arguably justify assigning the Chief Judge of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands for service on the Court of Appeals, for he is called a "district judge" of a court "within the [Ninth] Circuit." But a literal reading of  that sort is so capacious that it would also justify the designation of "district judges" of any number ofstate courts "within" the Ninth Circuit. 8Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Washington are all States within the Ninth Circuit whose judiciaries include "district judges." See Alaska Stat. §§ 22.15.010, 22.15.020, 22.20.010 (2002); Haw. Const., Art. VI, § 1; Haw. Rev. Stat. § 604-1 (1993); Idaho Const., Art. V, § 11; Idaho Code § 1-701 (1948-1998); Mont. Const., Art. VII, §§ 1,4,6; Nev. Const., Art. 6, §§ 5-6; Nev. Rev. Stat. § 1.010 (1995); Wash. Const., Art. IV, § 6 (West Supp. 2003); Wash. Rev. Code §§ 3.30.015, 3.30.030, 3.34.010, 3.66.010 (1988 and West Supp. 2003). The statute cannot plausibly be interpreted to authorize the improper panel assignment in these cases. 

Moreover, we do not read the designation statute without regard for the "historic significance" of the term "United States District Court" used in Title 28. Mookini v. United States, 303 U.S. 201, 205, 82 L. Ed. 748, 58 S. Ct. 543 (1938).  "Without an addition expressing a wider connotation," that term ordinarily excludes Article IV territorial courts, even when their jurisdiction is similar to that of a United States District Court created under Article III.  Ibid.See also Summers v. United States, 231 U.S. 92, 101-102, 58 L. Ed. 137, 34 S. Ct. 38 (1913) ("The courts of the Territories may have such jurisdiction of cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States as is vested in the circuit and district courts, but this does not make them circuit and district courts of the United States");Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 476-477, 43 L. Ed. 1041, 19 S. Ct. 722 (1899) ("It must be admitted that the words 'United States District Court' were not accurately used . . . [to refer to] the United States Court in the Indian Territory").  Construing the relevant statutory provisions together with further aid from historical usage, it is evident that Congress did not contemplate the judges of the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands to be "district judges" within the meaning of § 292(a).  It necessarily follows that the appointment of one member of the panel deciding petitioners' appeals was unauthorized. 9Petitioners contend that the participation of an Article IV judge on the panel violated structural constitutional guarantees embodied in Article III and in the Appointments Clause, Art. II, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  We find it unnecessary to discuss the constitutional questions because the statutory violation is clear.

III 

  Although the Solicitor General concedes that the panel of the Court of Appeals was improperly constituted, the Government advances three grounds on which the judgments below may rest undisturbed.  Two of the grounds on which we are urged to affirm concern petitioners' failure to object to the panel's composition in the Court of Appeals. Relying on the so-called "de facto officer" doctrine, the Government contends petitioners' failure to challenge the panel's composition at the earliest practicable moment completely forecloses relief in this Court.  The Government also contends that petitioners do not meet the requirements for relief under plain-error review.  The presence of a quorum of two otherwise-qualified judges on the Court of Appeals panel is invoked as the third ground sufficient to support the decision below.  We do not find these contentions persuasive. 

 The de facto officer doctrine, we have explained, "confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting  under the color of official title even though it is later discovered that the legality of that person's appointment or election to office is deficient." Ryder v. United States, 515 U.S. 177, 180, 132 L. Ed. 2d 136, 115 S. Ct. 2031 (1995).  Whatever the force of the de facto officer doctrine in other circumstances, an examination of our precedents concerning alleged irregularities in the assignment of judges does not compel us to apply it in these cases. 

Typically, we have found a judge's actions to be valid de facto when there is a "merely technical" defect of statutory authority. Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 535, 8 L. Ed. 2d 671, 82 S. Ct. 1459 (1962) (plurality opinion of Harlan, J.).  InMcDowell v. United States, 159 U.S. 596, 601-602, 40 L. Ed. 271, 16 S. Ct. 111 (1895), for example, the Court declined to notice alleged irregularities in a Circuit Judge's designation of a District Judge for temporary service in another district.  See also Ball v. United States, 140 U.S. 118, 128-129, 35 L. Ed. 377, 11 S. Ct. 761 (1891) (assigned judge had de facto authority to replace a deceased judge even though he had been designated to replace a disabled judge).  We observed in McDowell, however, that the judge whose assignment had been questioned was otherwise qualified to serve, because he was "a judge of the United States District Court, having all the powers attached to such office," and because the Circuit Judge was otherwise empowered to designate him.  159 US, at 601, 40 L Ed 271, 16 S Ct 111. 

By contrast, we have agreed to correct, at least on direct review, violations of a statutory provision that "embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business" even though the defect was not raised in a timely manner. Glidden, 370 U.S., at 536, 8 L Ed 2d 671, 82 S Ct 1459 (plurality opinion).  InAmerican Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148 U.S. 372, 37 L. Ed. 486, 13 S. Ct. 758 (1893), the case Justice Harlan cited for this proposition in Glidden, a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was challenged because one member of that court had been prohibited by statute from taking part in the hearing and decision of the appeal. 10The petitioners in American Constr. Co. challenged the participation of a Circuit Judge who, while sitting as a trial judge, had entered an order closely related to the matter under review in the Circuit Court of Appeals.  At the time, the relevant statute governing the composition of the circuit courts of appeals provided that "no justice or judge before whom a cause or question may have been tried or heard in a district court, or existing circuit court, shall sit on the trial or hearing of such cause or question in the circuit court of appeals." Evarts Act, ch 517, § 3, 26 Stat 827. This Court succinctly observed: "If the statute made him incompetent to sit at the hearing, the decree in which he took part was unlawful, and perhaps absolutely void, and should certainly be set aside or quashed by any court having authority to review it by appeal, error or certiorari." Id., at 387, 37 L Ed 486, 13 S Ct 758.  The American Constr. Co. rule was again applied inWilliam Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., 228 U.S. 645, 57 L. Ed. 1003, 33 S. Ct. 722 (1913), even though the parties had consented in the Circuit Court of Appeals to the participation of a District Judge who was not permitted by statute to consider the appeal. Id., at 650, 57 L Ed 1003, 33 S Ct 722.  Rather than sift through the  underlying merits, we remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals "so that the case may be heard by a competent court, [organized] comformably to the requirements of the statute." Id., at 651, 57 L Ed 1003, 33 S Ct 722.  See alsoMoran v. Dillingham, 174 U.S. 153, 158, 43 L. Ed. 930, 19 S. Ct. 620 (1899) ("This court, without considering whether that decree was or was not erroneous in other respects, orders the Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals to be set aside and quashed, and the case remanded to that court to be there heard and determined according to law by a bench of competent judges" (emphasis deleted)). 

We are confronted in petitioners' cases with a question of judicial authority more fundamental than whether "some effort has been made to conform with the formal conditions on which [a judge's] particular powers depend." Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., 61 F.2d 934, 938 (CA2 1932) (L. Hand, J.).  The difference between the irregular judicial designations inMcDowell andBall and the impermissible panel designation in the instant cases is therefore the difference between an action which could have been taken, if properly pursued, and one which could never have been taken at all.  Like the statutes in William Cramp & Sons, Moran, and American Constr. Co., § 292(a) embodies weighty congressional policy concerning the proper organization of the federal courts. 11The Government seeks to distinguishWilliam Cramp & SonsMoran, andAmerican Constr. Co. on the ground that the statutory provision at issue in each of those cases, unlike § 292(a), "expressly prohibited" the challenged judge's participation.  Brief for United States 18.  In light of our conclusion that there is no plausible interpretation of § 292(a) permitting the designation in the instant cases, see supra, at 539 U.S. 69, 156 L Ed 2d, at 73-75, 123 S. Ct. 2130, we think this is a distinction without a difference.  In any event, there was no "express" prohibition at play inUnited States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U.S. 685, 690-691, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1491, 80 S. Ct. 1336 (1960), in which this Court vacated the judgment of a Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, because a Senior Circuit Judge who had participated in the decision was not authorized by statute to do so.  See alsoid., at 691, 4 L Ed 2d 1491, 80 S Ct 1336 (Harlan, J., dissenting) ("The statute need hardly be read, as the Court now holds it should be, as saying that a case in an en banc court shall be 'heard and determined' by the active circuit judges"). Section 292(a) does not permit any assignment to service on the courts of appeals of a district judge who does not enjoy the protections set forth in Article III.  Congress' decision to preserve the Article III character of the courts of appeals is more than a trivial concern, cf.Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 57-60, 73 L. Ed. 2d 598, 102 S. Ct. 2858 (1982) (plurality opinion), and is entitled to respect.  The Chief Judge of the Northern Mariana Islands did not purport to have "all the powers attached to" the position of an Article III judge,McDowell, 159 U.S., at 601, 40 L Ed 271, 16 S Ct 111, nor was the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit otherwise permitted by § 292(a) to designate him for service on an Article III court.  Accordingly, his participation contravened the statutory requirements set by Congress for the composition of the federal courts of appeals. 

 For essentially the same reasons, we think it inappropriate to accept the Government's invitation to assess the merits of petitioners' convictions or whether the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings were impaired by the composition of the panel.  It is true, as the Government observes, that a failure to object to trial error ordinarily  limits an appellate court to review for plain error. See 28 USC § 2111 [28 USCS § 2111]; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b).  But to ignore the violation of the designation statute in these cases would incorrectly suggest that some action (or inaction) on petitioners' part could create authority Congress has quite carefully withheld. Even if the parties had expressly stipulated to the participation of a non-Article III judge in the consideration  of their appeals, no matter how distinguished and well qualified the judge might be, such a stipulation would not have cured the plain defect in the composition of the panel. 12 We agree with the Government's submission that the improper composition of the court below was "an isolated, one-time mistake." Brief for United States 5.  Countervailing concerns for gamesmanship, which animate the requirement for contemporaneous objection, therefore dissipate in these cases in light of the rarity of the improper panel assignment at issue. SeeWilliam Cramp & Sons, 228 U.S., at 650, 57 L Ed 1003, 33 S Ct 722. 

 More fundamentally, our enforcement of § 292(a)'s outer bounds is not driven so much by concern for the validity of petitioners' convictions at trial but for the validity of the composition of the Court of Appeals.  As a general rule, federal courts may not use their supervisory powers to circumvent the obligation to assess trial errors for their prejudicial effect.  SeeBank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 254-255, 101 L. Ed. 2d 228, 108 S. Ct. 2369 (1988).  Because the error in these cases involves a violation of a statutory provision that "embodies a strong policy concerning the proper administration of judicial business," however, our exercise of supervisory power is not inconsistent with that general rule. 13"The authority which Congress has granted this Court to review judgments of the courts of appeals undoubtedly vests us not only with the authority to correct errors of substantive law, but to prescribe the method by which those courts go about deciding the cases before them." Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.S. 386, 393, 40 L. Ed. 2d 215, 94 S. Ct. 1741 (1974) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).Glidden, 370 U.S., at 536, 8 L Ed 2d 671, 82 S Ct 1459 (plurality opinion).  Thus, we invalidated the judgment of a Court of Appeals without assessing prejudice, even though urged to do so, when the error alleged was the improper composition of that court.  SeeUnited States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U.S. 685, 690-691, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1491, 80 S. Ct. 1336 (1960) (vacating judgment of en banc Court of Appeals because participation by Senior Circuit Judge was not provided by statute). 

  It is also true that two judges of a three-judge panel constitute a quorum legally able to transact business. 14 Title 28 U.S.C. § 46(d) [28 USCS § 46(d)] provides: "A majority of the number of judges authorized to constitute a court or panel thereof . . . shall constitute a quorum." As used in § 46(d), "quorum . . . means such a number of the members of the court as may legally transact judicial business." Tobin v. Ramey, 206 F.2d 505, 507 (CA5 1953). Moreover, settled law permits a quorum to proceed to judgment when one member of the panel dies or is disqualified. United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 241 F.2d 925, 927 (CA2 1957) (L. Hand, J.).  For two reasons, however, the presence of a quorum on the Ninth Circuit panel does not save the judgments below.  First, the quorum  statute has been on the books (in relevant part essentially unchanged) for over a century, 15See Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 6, § 117, 36 Stat. 1131: "There shall be in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum . . . ." The Evarts Act, which established the original circuit courts of appeals, contained essentially the same provision: "[T]here is hereby created in each circuit a circuit court of appeals, which shall consist of three judges, of whom two shall constitute a quorum." ch. 517, § 2, 26 Stat. 826. yet this Court has never doubted its power to vacate the judgment entered by an improperly constituted court of appeals, even when there was a quorum of judges competent to consider the appeal.  SeeUnited States v. American-Foreign S. S. Corp., 363 U.S. 685, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1491, 80 S. Ct. 1336 (1960);William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., 228 U.S. 645, 57 L. Ed. 1003, 33 S. Ct. 722 (1913);American Constr. Co. v. Jacksonville, T. & K. W. R. Co., 148 U.S. 372, 37 L. Ed. 486, 13 S. Ct. 758 (1893). 

 Second, the statutory authority for courts of appeals to sit in panels, 28 U.S.C. § 46(b) [28 USCS § 46(b)], requires the inclusion of at least three judges in the first instance. 16Title 28 U.S.C. § 46(b) [28 USCS § 46(b)] provides, in pertinent part:  "In each circuit the court may authorize the hearing and determination of cases and controversies by separate panels, each consisting of three judges, at least a majority of whom shall be judges of that court, unless such judges cannot sit because recused or disqualified . . . ." As the Second Circuit  has noted, Congress apparently enacted § 46(b) in part "to curtail the prior practice under which some circuits were routinely assigning some cases to two-judge panels." Murray v. National Broadcasting Co., 35 F.3d 45, 47 (1994).  It is "clear that the statute was not intended to preclude disposition by a panel of two judges in the event that one member of a three-judge panel to which the appeal is assigned becomes unable to participate," ibid., but it is less clear whether the quorum statute offers postjudgment absolution for the participation of a judge who was not otherwise competent to be part of the panel under § 292(a).  Thus, although the two Article III judges who took part in the decision of petitioners' appeals would have constituted a quorum if the original panel had been properly created, it is at least highly doubtful whether they had any authority to serve by themselves as a panel.  In light of that doubt, it is appropriate to return these cases to the Ninth Circuit for fresh consideration of petitioners' appeals by a properly constituted panel organized "comformably to the requirements of the statute." 17 Unlike the dissent, we believe that it would "flout the stated will of Congress," post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 80 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), and call into serious question the integrity as well as the public reputation of judicial proceedings to permit the decision below to stand, for no one other than a properly constituted panel of Article III judges was empowered to exercise appellate jurisdiction in these cases.William Cramp & Sons Ship & Engine Building Co. v. International Curtiss Marine Turbine Co., 228 U.S., at 651, 57 L Ed 1003, 33 S Ct 722. 

 Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 California's Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act of 1999 (HVIRA or Act), Cal. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 13800-13807 (West Cum. Supp. 2003), requires any insurer doing business in that State to disclose information about all policies sold in Europe between 1920 and 1945 by the company itself or any one "related" to it.  The issue here is whether HVIRA interferes with the National Government's conduct of foreign relations. We hold that it does, with the consequence that the state statute is preempted.

A 

The Nazi Government of Germany engaged not only in genocide and enslavement but theft of Jewish assets, including  the value of insurance policies, and in particular policies of life insurance, a form of savings held by many Jews in Europe before the Second World War.  Early on in the Nazi era, loss of livelihood forced Jews to cash in life insurance policies prematurely, only to have the government seize the proceeds of the repurchase, and many who tried to emigrate from Germany were forced to liquidate insurance policies to pay the steep "flight taxes" and other levies imposed by the Third Reich to keep Jewish assets from leaving the country.  See G. Feldman, Allianz and the German Insurance Business, 1933-1945, pp 249-262 (2001).  Before long, the Reich began simply seizing the remaining policies outright. 1A vivid precursor of the kind of direct confiscation that would become widespread by 1941 was the Reich's seizure of property and casualty insurance proceeds in the aftermath of the November 1938 Kristallnacht, in which Nazi looting and vandalism inflicted damage to Jewish businesses, homes, and synagogues worth nearly 50 million deutsch marks.  Days afterward, a Reich decree mandated that all proceeds of all insurance claims arising from the damage be paid directly to the state treasury, an obligation ultimately settled by German insurance companies with the Reich at a mere pittance relative to full value.  See Feldman, at 190-235. In 1941, the 11th Decree of the Reich Citizenship Law declared the confiscation of assets (including insurance policies) of Jews deported to the concentration camps, and two years later the 13th Decree did the same with respect to property of the dead, each decree requiring banks and insurance companies to identify Jewish accounts and transmit the funds  to the Reich treasury.  Id., at 264-274.  After the war, even a policy that had escaped confiscation was likely to be dishonored, whether because insurers denied its existence or claimed it had lapsed from unpaid premiums during the persecution, or because the government would not provide heirs with documentation of the policyholder's death.  See M. Bazyler, Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts 117-122 (2003).  Responsibility as between the government and insurance companies is disputed, but at the end  of the day, the fact is that the value or proceeds of many insurance policies issued to Jews before and during the war were paid to the Reich or never paid at all. 

These confiscations and frustrations of claims fell within the subject of reparations, which became a principal object of Allied diplomacy soon after the war.  At the Potsdam Conference, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union took reparations for wartime losses by seizing industrial assets from their respective occupation zones, putting into effect the plan originally envisioned at the Yalta Conference months before.  Protocol of Proceedings of the Berlin (Potsdam) Conference, 1945, in 3 Dept. of State, Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949, pp 1207, 1213-1214 (C. Bevans comp. 1969) (hereinafter Bevans); Report of the Crimea (Yalta) Conference, 1945, in 3 Bevans 1005; Protocol of the Crimea (Yalta) Conference on the Question of the German Reparation in Kind, 1945, in 3 Bevans 1020. A year later, the United States was among the parties to an agreement to share seized assets with other western allies as settlement, as to each signatory nation, of "all its claims and those of its nationals against the former German Government and its Agencies, of a governmental or private nature, arising out of the war." Agreement on Reparation from Germany, on the Establishment of Inter-Allied Reparation Agency and Restitution of Monetary Gold, 61 Stat 3163, Art. 2(A), T. I. A. S. No. 1655 (hereinafter Paris Agreement). 

The effect of the Paris Agreement was curtailed, however, and attention to reparations intentionally deferred, when the western allies moved to end their occupation and reestablish a sovereign Germany as a buffer against Soviet expansion.  They worried that continued reparations would cripple the new Federal Republic of Germany economically, and so decided in the London Debt Agreement to put off "consideration of claims arising out of the second World War by countries which were at war with or were occupied by Germany during that war, and by nationals of such countries, against the Reich and agencies of the Reich . . . until the final settlement of the problem of reparation." Agreement on German External Debts, Feb. 27, 1953, 4 U. S. T. 443, 449, T. I. A. S. No. 2792.  These terms were construed by German courts as postponing resolution of foreign claims against both the German Government and German industry, to await the terms of an ultimate postwar treaty. See Neuborne, Preliminary Reflections on Aspects of Holocaust-Era Litigation in American Courts,80 Wash. U. L. Q. 795, 813-814, and n 62 (2002). 

In the meantime, the western allies placed the obligation to provide restitution to victims of Nazi persecution on the new West German  Government.  See Convention on the Settlement of Matters Arising Out of the War and the Occupation, May 26, 1952, 6 U. S. T. 4411, 4452-4484, as amended by Protocol on Termination of the Occupation Regime in the Federal Republic of Germany, Oct. 23, 1954, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 4117, T. I. A. S. No. 3425.  This had previously been a responsibility of the western military governments, which had issued several decrees for the return of property confiscated by the Nazis.  See N. Robinson, Restitution Legislation in Germany: A Survey of Enactments (1949); U. S. Military Law Nos. 52 and 59 (reprinted in U. S. Military Government Gazette, Germany, Issue A, p 24 (June 1, 1946) and Issue G, p 1 (Nov. 10, 1947)).  West Germany enacted its own restitution laws in 1953 and 1956, see Institute of Jewish Affairs, The (West German) Federal Compensation Law (BEG) and its Implementary Regulations (1957), and signed agreements with 16 countries for the compensation of their nationals, including the Luxembourg Agreement with Israel, Sept. 10, 1952, 162 U. N. T. S. 205; see Supplemental Excerpts of Record in No. 01-17023 (CA9) (SER), p 1244.  Despite a payout of more than 100 billion deutsch marks as of 2000, see ibid., these measures left out many claimants and certain types of claims, and when the agreement reunifying East and West  Germany, see Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, Sept. 12, 1990, 1696 U. N. T. S. 124, was read by the German courts as lifting the London Debt Agreement's moratorium on Holocaust claims by foreign nationals, class-action lawsuits for restitution poured into United States courts against companies doing business in Germany during the Nazi era.  See Neuborne, supra, at 796, n 2, 813-814; see generally Bazyler, Nuremberg in America: Litigating the Holocaust in United States Courts, 34 Rich. L. Rev. 1 (2000) (describing the flood of lawsuits after 1996). 

These suits generated much protest by the defendant companies and their governments, to the point that the Government of the United States took action to try to resolve "the last great compensation related negotiation arising out of World War II." SER 940 (press briefing by Deputy Secretary of Treasury Eizenstat); see S. Eizenstat, Imperfect Justice 208-212 (2003).  From the beginning, the Government's position, represented principally by Under Secretary of State (later Deputy Treasury Secretary) Stuart Eizenstat, stressed mediated settlement "as an alternative to endless litigation" promising little relief to aging Holocaust survivors. SER 953 (press conference by Secretary of State Albright).  Ensuing negotiations at the national level produced the German Foundation Agreement, signed by President Clinton and German Chancellor Schroder in July 2000, in which Germany agreed to enact legislation establishing a foundation funded with 10 billion deutsch marks contributed equally by the German Government and German companies, to be used to compensate all those "who suffered at the hands of German companies during the National Socialist era." Agreement Concerning the Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and the Future," 39 Int'l Legal Materials 1298 (2000). 

 The willingness of the Germans to create a voluntary compensation fund was conditioned on some expectation of security from lawsuits in United States courts, and after  extended dickering President Clinton put his weight behind two specific measures toward that end.  SER 937 (letter from President Clinton to Chancellor Schrooder committing to a "mechanism to provide the legal peace desired by the German government and German companies"); see also Eizenstat, supra, at 253-258.  First, the Government agreed that whenever a German company was sued on a Holocaust-era claim in an American court, the Government of the United States would submit a statement that "it would be in the foreign policy interests of the United States for the Foundation to be the exclusive forum and remedy for the resolution of all asserted claims against German companies arising from their involvement in the National Socialist era and World War II." 39 Int'l Legal Materials, at 1303.  Though unwilling to guarantee that its foreign policy interests would "in themselves provide an independent legal basis for dismissal," that being an issue for the courts, the Government agreed to tell courts "that U. S. policy interests favor dismissal on any valid legal ground." Id., at 1304.  On top of that undertaking, the Government promised to use its "best efforts, in a manner it considers appropriate," to get state and local governments to respect the foundation as the exclusive mechanism.  Id., at 1300. 2The executive agreement was accompanied by a joint statement signed by the American and German Governments, the Governments of Israel and five Eastern European countries, and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, Inc., "recognizing that it would be in the participants' interests for the Foundation to be the exclusive remedy and forum" for all Holocaust-era claims against German companies.  Excerpt of Record in No. 01-17023 (CA9) (ER), pp 812-816.

 As for insurance claims specifically, both countries agreed that the German Foundation would work with the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC), a voluntary organization formed in 1998 by several European insurance companies, the State of Israel, Jewish and Holocaust survivor associations, and the National  Association of Insurance Commissioners, the organization of American state insurance commissioners.  The job of the ICHEIC, chaired by former Secretary of State Eagleburger, includes negotiation with European insurers to provide information about unpaid insurance policies issued to Holocaust victims and settlement of claims brought under them.  It has thus set up procedures for handling demands against participating insurers, including "a reasonable review . . . of the participating companies' files" for production of unpaid policies, "an investigatory process to determine the current status" of insurance policies for which claims are filed, and a "claims and valuation process to settle and pay individual claims," employing "relaxed standards of proof." SER 1236-1237. 

In the pact with the United States, Germany stipulated that "insurance claims that come within the scope of the current claims handling procedures adopted by the [ICHEIC] and are made against German insurance companies shall be processed by the companies and the German Insurance Association on the basis of such procedures and on the basis of additional claims handling procedures that may be agreed among the Foundation,  ICHEIC, and the German Insurance Association." 39 Int'l Legal Materials, at 1299.  And in a supplemental agreement formalized in October 2002, the German Foundation agreed to set aside 200 million deutsch marks, to be used for insurance claims approved by the ICHEIC and a portion of the ICHEIC's operating expenses, with another 100 million in reserve if the initial fund should run out.  Agreement Concerning Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, in Lodging of Petitioners in Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. v Garamendi, No. 02-733, pp L-70 to L-71, L-78 to L-79, cert. pending.  The foundation also bound itself to contribute 350 million deutsch marks to a "humanitarian fund" administered by the ICHEIC, id., at L-80, and it agreed to work with the German Insurance Association and the German insurers who  had joined the ICHEIC, "with a view to publishing as comprehensive a list as possible of holders of insurance policies issued by German companies who may have been Holocaust victims," id., at L-147.  Those efforts, which control release of information in ways that respect German privacy laws limiting publication of business records, have resulted in the recent release of the names of over 360,000 Holocaust victims owning life insurance policies issued by German insurers. See Treaster, Holocaust List Is Unsealed by Insurers, N. Y. Times, Apr. 29, 2003, section A, p 26, col. 6. 

The German Foundation pact has served as a model for similar agreements with Austria and France, 3Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of France Concerning Payments for Certain Losses Suffered During World War II, Jan. 18, 2001, 2001 WL 416465; Agreement between the Austrian Federal Government and the Government of the United States of America Concerning the Austrian Fund "Reconciliation, Peace and Cooperation," 40 Int'l Legal Materials 523 (2001); Agreement Relating to the Agreement of October 24, 2000, Concerning the Austrian Fund "Reconciliation, Peace and Cooperation," Jan. 23, 2001, 2001 WL 935261, Annex A, § 2(n).  Though the French agreement does not address insurance, the agreement with Austria does.  Austria agreed to devote a $25 million fund for payment of claims processed according to the ICHEIC's procedures.  See ibid.Austria also agreed to "make the lists of Holocaust era policy holders publicly accessible, to the extent available." Ibid. The United States Government agreed, in turn, that the settlement fund should be viewed as "the exclusive . . . forum" for the resolution of Holocaust-era claims asserted against the Austrian Government or Austrian companies.  40 Int'l Legal Materials, at 524. and the United States Government continues to pursue comparable agreements with other countries.  Reply Brief for Petitioners 6, n 2. 

 B 

While these international efforts were underway, California's Department of Insurance began its own enquiry into the issue of unpaid claims under Nazi-era insurance policies, prompting state legislation designed to force payment by defaulting insurers. In 1998, the state legislature made it an  unfair business practice for any insurer operating in the State to "fail to pay any valid claim from Holocaust survivors." Cal. Ins. Code Ann. § 790.15(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2003).  The legislature placed "an affirmative duty" on the Department of Insurance "to play an independent role in representing the interests of Holocaust survivors," including an obligation to "gather, review, and analyze the archives of insurers . . . to provide for research and investigation" into unpaid insurance claims.  §§ 12967(a)(1), (2). 

State legislative efforts culminated  the next year with passage of Assembly Bill No. 600, 1999 Cal. Stats. ch. 827, the first section of which amended the State's Code of Civil Procedure to allow state residents to sue in state court on insurance claims based on acts perpetrated in the Holocaust and extended the governing statute of limitations to December 31, 2010.  Cal. Civ.  Proc. Code Ann. § 354.5 (West Cum. Supp. 2003).  The section of the bill codified as HVIRA, at issue here, 4Challenges to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. § 354.5 (West Cum. Supp. 2003) and Cal. Ins. Code Ann. § 790.15 (West Cum. Supp. 2003) were dismissed by the District Court for lack of standing, a ruling that was not appealed.  SeeGerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of America v. Low, 240 F.3d 739, 742-743 (CA9 2001). requires "any insurer currently doing business in the state" to disclose the details of "life, property, liability, health, annuities, dowry, educational, or casualty insurance policies" issued "to persons in Europe, which were in effect between 1920 and 1945." Cal. Ins. Code Ann. § 13804(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2003).  The duty is to make disclosure not only about policies the particular insurer sold, but also about those sold by any "related company," ibid., including "any parent, subsidiary, reinsurer, successor in interest, managing general agent, or affiliate company of the insurer," § 13802(b), 5These terms are further defined in the commissioner's regulations.  Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 10, § 2278.1 (1996).  An "affiliate" company is one that "directly, or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with, the [insurer]." Cal. Ins. Code Ann. § 1215(a) (West 1993) (cross-referenced in § 2278.1(e)).  A "managing general agent" is a company that "negotiates and binds ceding reinsurance contracts on behalf of an insurer or manages all or part of the insurance business of an insurer." § 769.819(c) (cross-referenced in § 2278.1(c)).  A "reinsurer" is "a parent, subsidiary or affiliate of the insurer that provides reinsurance." Cal. Code Regs., Tit. 10, § 2278.1(i) (1996). whether or not the companies were related during  the time when the policies subject to disclosure were sold, § 13804(a).  Nor is the obligation restricted to policies sold to "Holocaust victims" as defined in the Act, § 13802(a); it covers policies sold to anyone during that time, § 13804(a).  The insurer must report the current status of each policy, the city of origin, domicile, or address of each policyholder, and the names of the beneficiaries, § 13804(a), all of which is to be put in a central registry open to the public, § 13803.  The mandatory penalty for default is suspension of the company's license to do business in the State, § 13806, and there are misdemeanor criminal sanctions for falsehood in certain required representations about whether and to whom the proceeds of each policy have been distributed, § 13804(b). 

 HVIRA was meant to enhance enforcement of both the unfair business practice provision (§ 790.15) and the provision for suit on the policies in question (§ 354.5) by "ensuring that any involvement [that licensed California insurers] or their related companies may have had with insurance policies of Holocaust victims are [sic] disclosed to the state." § 13801(e); see ibid. (HVIRA is designed to "ensure the rapid resolution" of unpaid insurance claims, "eliminating the further victimization of these policyholders and their families"); Excerpt of Record in No. 01-17023 (CA9) (ER), p 994 (California Senate Committee on Insurance report) (HVIRA was proposed to "ensure that Holocaust victims or their heirs can take direct action on their own behalf with regard to insurance policies and  claims").  While the legislature acknowledged that "the international Jewish community is in active  negotiations with responsible insurance companies through the [ICHEIC] to resolve all outstanding insurance claims issues," it still thought the Act "necessary to protect the claims and interests of California residents, as well as to encourage the development of a resolution to these issues through the international process or through direct action by the State of California, as necessary." § 13801(f). 

After HVIRA was enacted, administrative subpoenas were issued against several subsidiaries of European insurance companies participating in the ICHEIC.  See, e.g., SER 785, 791.  Immediately, in November 1999, Deputy Secretary Eizenstat wrote to the insurance commissioner of California that although HVIRA "reflects a genuine commitment to justice for Holocaust victims and their families, it has the unfortunate effect of damaging the one effective means now at hand to process quickly and completely unpaid insurance claims from the Holocaust period, the [ICHEIC]." SER 975.  The Deputy Secretary said that "actions by California, pursuant to this law, have already threatened to damage the cooperative spirit which the [ICHEIC] requires to resolve the important issue for Holocaust survivors," and he also noted that ICHEIC Chairman Eagleburger had expressed his opposition to "sanctions and other pressures brought by California on companies with whom he is obtaining real cooperation." Id., at 976.  The same day, Deputy Secretary Eizenstat also wrote to California's Governor making the same points, and stressing that HVIRA would possibly derail the German Foundation Agreement: "Clearly, for this deal to work . . . German industry and the German government need to be assured that they will get 'legal peace,' not just from class-action lawsuits, but from the kind of legislation represented by the California Victim Insurance Relief Act." Id., at 970.  These expressions of the National Government's concern proved to be of no consequence, for the state commissioner announced at an investigatory hearing in December 1999 that he would enforce HVIRA to its  fullest, requiring the affected insurers to make the disclosures, leave the State voluntarily, or lose their licenses.  ER 1097. 

II 

After this ultimatum, the petitioners here, several American and European insurance companies and the American Insurance Association (a national trade association), filed suit for injunctive relief against respondent insurance commissioner of California, challenging the constitutionality of HVIRA.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction against enforcing the Act, reflecting its probability judgment that "HVIRA is unconstitutional based on a violation of the federal foreign affairs power and a violation of the Commerce Clause." App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit rejected these grounds for questioning the Act but left the preliminary injunction in place until the District Court could consider whether plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their due process claim. Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of America v. Low, 240 F.3d 739, 754 (2001). 

On remand, the District Court addressed two points.  Although it held  the Act to be within the State's "legislative jurisdiction," as it applied only to insurers licensed to do business in the State, the District Court granted summary judgment to the petitioners on the ground of a procedural due process violation in "mandating license suspension for non-performance of what may be impossible tasks without allowing for a meaningful hearing." Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of America v. Low, 186 F. Supp. 2d 1099, 1108, 1113 (ED Cal. 2001).  In a second appeal, the same panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed again.  While it agreed that the Act was not beyond the State's legislative authority, the Court of Appeals rejected the conclusion that procedural due process required an opportunity for insurers to raise an impossibility excuse for noncompliance with the law,296 F.3d 832, 845-848 (2002), and it reaffirmed its prior ruling that  the Act violated neither the foreign affairs nor the foreign commerce powers,id., at 849.  Given the importance of the issue, 6Several other States have passed laws similar to HVIRA.  See Holocaust Victims Insurance Act, Fla. Stat. § 626.9543 (Cum. Supp. 2003); Holocaust Victims Insurance Act, Md. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 28-101 to 28- 110 (2002); Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 2000, Minn. Stat. § 60A.053 (Cum. Supp. 2003); Holocaust Victims Insurance Act of 1998, N. Y. Ins. Law §§ 2701-2711 (Consol. 2000); Holocaust Victims Insurance Relief Act of 1999, Wash. Rev. Code §§ 48.104.010-48.104.903 (2003); see also Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 20-490 (West Cum. Supp. 2003); Texas Ins. Code Ann. Art. 21.74 (2003).  And similar bills have been proposed in other States.  See, e.g., Mass. Senate Bill No. 843 (Jan. 1, 2003). we granted certiorari, 537 U.S. 1100, 537 U.S. 1100, 154 L. Ed. 2d 768, 123 S. Ct. 817 (2003), and now reverse. 7Two petitions for certiorari were filed, one by the petitioners in this case (No. 02-722), and one, raising additional issues, by the Gerling Companies (No. 02-733), which were also appellees below.  Our grant of certiorari in No. 02-722 encompassed three of the questions addressed by the Ninth Circuit: whether HVIRA intrudes on the federal foreign affairs power, violates the self-executing element of the Foreign Commerce Clause, or exceeds the State's "legislative jurisdiction." Pet. for Cert. I.  Because we hold that HVIRA is preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine, we have no reason to address the other questions.

III 

 The principal argument for preemption made by petitioners and the United States as amicus curiae is that HVIRA interferes with foreign policy of the Executive Branch, as expressed principally in the executive agreements with Germany, Austria, and France.  The major premises of the argument, at least, are beyond dispute.  There is, of course, no question that at some point an exercise of state power that touches on foreign relations must yield to the National Government's policy, given the "concern for uniformity in this country's dealings with foreign nations" that animated the Constitution's allocation of the foreign relations power to the National Government in the first place. Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino,376 U.S. 398, 427, n. 25, 11 L. Ed. 2d 804, 84 S. Ct. 923 (1964); seeCrosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 381-382, n. 16, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 120 S. Ct. 2288 (2000) ("'The peace of the WHOLE ought not to be left at the disposal of a PART'" (quoting The Federalist No. 80, pp 535-536 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton))); The Federalist No. 44, p 299 (J. Madison) (emphasizing "the advantage of uniformity in all points which relate to foreign powers"); The Federalist No. 42, p 279 (J. Madison) ("If we are to be one nation in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other nations");  see alsoFirst Nat. City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba,406 U.S. 759, 769, 32 L. Ed. 2d 466, 92 S. Ct. 1808 (1972) (plurality opinion) (act of state doctrine was "fashioned because of fear that adjudication would interfere with the conduct of foreign relations");Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles,441 U.S. 434, 449, 60 L. Ed. 2d 336, 99 S. Ct. 1813 (1979) (negative Foreign Commerce Clause protects the National Government's ability to speak with "one voice" in regulating commerce with foreign countries (internal quotation marks omitted)). 

Nor is there any question generally that there is executive authority to decide what that policy should be.  Although the source of the President's power to act in foreign affairs does not enjoy any textual detail, the historical gloss on the "executive Power" vested in Article II of the Constitution has recognized the President's "vast share of responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations." Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,343 U.S. 579, 610-611, 96 L. Ed. 1153, 72 S. Ct. 863, 62 Ohio Law Abs. 417 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  While Congress holds express authority to regulate public and private dealings with other nations in its war and foreign commerce powers, in foreign affairs the President has a degree of independent authority to act.  See, e.g.,Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp.,333 U.S. 103, 109, 92 L. Ed. 568, 68 S. Ct. 431 (1948) ("The President . . . possesses in his own right certain powers conferred by the Constitution on him as Commander-in-Chief and as the Nation's organ in foreign affairs");Youngstown , supra, at 635-636, n. 2, 96 L Ed 1153, 72 S Ct 863 (Jackson, J., concurring in judgment and opinion of Court) (the President can "act in external affairs without congressional authority" (citingUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,299 U.S. 304, 81 L. Ed. 255, 57 S. Ct. 216 (1936)));First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba, supra, at 767, 32 L Ed 2d 466, 92 S Ct 1808 (the President has "the lead role . . . in foreign policy" (citingSabbatino, supra));Sale v. Haitian Centers Council, Inc.,509 U.S. 155, 188, 125 L. Ed. 2d 128, 113 S. Ct. 2549 (1993) (the President has "unique responsibility" for the conduct of "foreign and military affairs"). 

 At a more specific level, our cases have recognized that the President has authority to make "executive agreements" with other countries, requiring no ratification by the Senate or approval by Congress, this power having been exercised since the early years of the Republic.  SeeDames & Moore v. Regan,453 U.S. 654, 679, 682-683, 69 L. Ed. 2d 918, 101 S. Ct. 2972 (1981);United States v. Pink,315 U.S. 203, 223, 230, 86 L. Ed. 796, 62 S. Ct. 552 (1942);United States v. Belmont,301 U.S. 324, 330-331, 81 L. Ed. 1134, 57 S. Ct. 758 (1937); see also L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United StatesConstitution 219, 496, n 163 (2d ed. 1996) ("Presidents from Washington to Clinton have made many thousands of agreements . . . on matters running the gamut of U. S. foreign relations").  Making executive agreements to settle claims of American nationals against foreign governments is a particularly longstanding practice, the first example being as early as 1799, when the Washington administration settled demands against the Dutch Government by American citizens who lost their cargo when Dutch privateers over-took  the schooner Wilmington Packet.SeeDames & Moore, supra, at 679-680 and n.8, 69 L Ed 2d 918, 101 S Ct 2972; 5 Dept. of State, Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States 1075, 1078-1079 (H. Miller ed. 1937).  Given the fact that the practice goes back over 200 years to the first Presidential administration, and has received congressional acquiescence throughout its history, the conclusion "that the President's control of foreign relations includes the settlement of claims is indisputable." Pink, supra, at 240, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552 (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see315 U.S., at 223-225, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552  (opinion of the Court); Belmont, supra, at 330-331 81 L Ed 1134, 57 S Ct 758;Dames & Moore , supra, at 682, 69 L Ed 2d 918, 101 S Ct 2972. 

The executive agreements at issue here do differ in one respect from those just mentioned insofar as they address  claims associated with formerly belligerent states, but against corporations, not the foreign governments.  But the distinction does not matter.  Historically, wartime claims against even nominally private entities have become issues in international diplomacy, and three of the postwar settlements dealing with reparations implicating private parties were made by the Executive alone. 8The Yalta and Potsdam Agreements envisioning dismantling of Germany's industrial assets, public and private, and the follow-up Paris Agreement aspiring to settle the claims of western nationals against the German Government and private agencies were made as executive agreements.  See supra, at 156 L Ed 2d 376, at 388 (citing agreements); see also L. Margolis, Executive Agreements and Presidential Power in Foreign Policy 15-16 (1986). Acceptance of this historical practice is supported by a good pragmatic reason for depending on executive agreements to settle claims against foreign corporations associated with wartime experience.  As shown by the history of insurance confiscation mentioned earlier, untangling government policy from private initiative during war time is often so hard that diplomatic action settling claims against private parties may well be just as essential in the aftermath of hostilities as diplomacy to settle claims against foreign governments.  While a sharp line between public and private acts works for many purposes in the domestic law, insisting on the same line in defining the legitimate scope of the Executive's international negotiations would hamstring the President in settling international controversies.  Cf.Pink, supra, at 234-242, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (noting the unsoundness of transplanting "judicial subtleties" of domestic law into "the solution of analogous problems between friendly nations"). 

 Generally, then, valid executive agreements are fit to preempt state law, just as treaties are, 9 Subject, that is, to the Constitution's guarantees of individual rights.  SeeReid v. Covert,354 U.S. 1, 15-19, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1148, 77 S. Ct. 1222 (1957);Boos v. Barry,485 U.S. 312, 324, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333, 108 S. Ct. 1157 (1988).  Even Justice Sutherland's reading of the National Government's "inherent" foreign affairs power inUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,299 U.S. 304, 81 L. Ed. 255, 57 S. Ct. 216 (1936), contained the caveat that the power, "like every other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable provisions of the Constitution." Id., at 320, 81 L Ed 255, 57 S Ct 216. and if the agreements here had expressly preempted laws like HVIRA, the issue would be straightforward.  SeeBelmont, supra, at 327, 331, 81 L Ed 1134, 57 S Ct 758;Pink, supra, at  223, 230-231, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552.  But petitioners and the United States as amicus curiae both have to acknowledge that the agreements include no preemption clause, and so leave their claim of preemption to rest on asserted interference with the foreign policy those agreements embody.  Reliance is placed on our decision inZschernig v. Miller,389 U.S. 429, 19 L. Ed. 2d 683, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968). 

Zschernig dealt with an Oregon probate statute prohibiting inheritance by a nonresident alien, absent showings that the foreign heir would take the property "without confiscation" by his home country and that American citizens would enjoy reciprocal rights of inheritance there. Id., at 430-431, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664.  Two decades earlier,Clark v. Allen,331 U.S. 503, 91 L. Ed. 1633, 67 S. Ct. 1431 (1947), had held that a similar California reciprocity law "did not on its face intrude on the federal domain,"Zschernig, supra, at 432, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664, but by the time Zschernig (an East German resident) brought his challenge, it was clear that the Oregon law in practice had invited "minute inquiries concerning the actual administration of foreign law," 389 US, at 435, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664, and so was providing occasions for state judges to disparage certain foreign regimes, employing the language of the anti-Communism prevalent here at the height of the Cold War, seeid., at 440, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (the Oregon law had made "unavoidable judicial criticism of nations established on a more authoritarian basis than our own").  Although the Solicitor General, speaking for the State Department, denied that the state statute "unduly interfered with the United States' conduct of foreign relations,"id., at 434, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court was not deterred from exercising its own judgment to invalidate the law as an "intrusion by the State into the field of foreign affairs which the Constitution entrusts to the President and the Congress,"id., at 432, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664. 

 The Zschernig majority relied on statements in a number of previous cases open to the reading that state action with more than incidental effect on foreign affairs is preempted, even absent any affirmative federal activity in the subject area of the state law, and hence without any showing of conflict.  The Court cited the pronouncement inHines v. Davidowitz,312 U.S. 52, 63, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61 S. Ct. 399 (1941), that "our system of government is such that the interest of the cities, counties and states, no less than the interest of the people of the whole nation, imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from local interference." See 389 US, at 432, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664;id., at 442-443, at 442-443, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (Stewart, J., concurring) (setting out the foregoing quotation).  Likewise, Justice Stewart's concurring opinion viewed the Oregon statute as intruding "into a domain of exclusively federal competence." Id., at 442, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664; see alsoBelmont, 301 U.S., at 331, 81 L Ed 1134, 57 S Ct 758 ("Complete power over international affairs is in the national government and is not and cannot be subject to any curtailment or interference on the part of the several states" (citingCurtiss-Wright  Export Corp.,299 U.S., at 316, 81 L Ed 255, 57 S Ct 216.)). 

Justice Harlan, joined substantially by Justice White, disagreed with the Zschernig majority on this point, arguing that its implication of preemption of the entire field of foreign affairs was at odds with some other cases suggesting that in the absence of positive federal action "the States may legislate in areas of their traditional competence even though their statutes may have an incidental effect on foreign relations." 389 US, at 459, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (opinion concurring in result) (citing cases); seeid., at 462, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (White,  J., dissenting). 10Justice Harlan concurred in the majority's result because he would have found the Oregon statute preempted by a 1923 treaty with Germany.  389 US, at 457, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664.  This required overruling the Court's construction of that treaty inClark v. Allen, 331 U.S. 503, 91 L. Ed. 1633, 67 S. Ct. 1431 (1947), which Justice White, in dissent, declined to do, 389 US, at 462, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664. Thus, for Justice Harlan it was crucial that the challenge to the Oregon statute presented no evidence of a "specific interest of the Federal Government which might be interfered with" by the law. Id., at 459, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (opinion concurring in result); seeid., at 461, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (finding "no evidence of adverse effect in the record").  He would, however, have found preemption in a case of "conflicting federal policy," seeid., at 458-459, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664, and on this point the majority and Justices Harlan and White basically agreed: state laws "must give way if they impair the effective exercise of the Nation's foreign policy,"id., at 440, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664 (opinion of the Court).  See alsoPink, 315 U.S., at 230-231, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552 ("State law must yield when it is inconsistent with, or impairs . . . the superior Federal policy evidenced by a treaty or international compact or agreement");id., at 240, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552 (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (state law may not be allowed to "interfere with the conduct of our foreign relations by the Executive"). 

 It is a fair question whether respect for the executive foreign relations power requires a categorical choice between the contrasting theories of field and conflict preemption evident in the Zschernig opinions, 11The two positions can be seen as complementary.  If a State were simply to take a position on a matter of foreign policy with no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility, field preemption might be the appropriate doctrine, whether the National Government had acted and, if it had, without reference to the degree of any conflict, the principle having been established that the Constitution entrusts foreign policy exclusively to the National Government. See, e.g.,Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 63, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61 S. Ct. 399 (1941).  Where, however, a State has acted within what Justice Harlan called its "traditional competence," 389 US, at 459, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664, but in a way that affects foreign relations, it might make good sense to require a conflict, of a clarity or substantiality that would vary with the strength or the traditional importance of the state concern asserted.  Whether the strength of the federal foreign policy interest should itself be weighed is, of course, a further question.  Cf.Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.,331 U.S. 218, 230, 91 L. Ed. 1447, 67 S. Ct. 1146 (1947) (congressional occupation of the field is not to be presumed "in a field which the States have traditionally occupied");Boyle v. United Technologies Corp.,487 U.S. 500, 507-508, 101 L. Ed. 2d 442, 108 S. Ct. 2510 (1988) ("In an area of uniquely federal interest," "the conflict with federal policy need not be as sharp as that which must exist for ordinary pre-emption"). but the question requires  no answer here.  For even on Justice Harlan's view, the likelihood that state legislation  will produce something more than incidental effect in conflict with express foreign policy of the National Government would require preemption of the state law. And since on his view it is legislation within "areas of . . . traditional competence" that gives a State any claim to prevail, 389 US, at 459, 19 L Ed 2d 683, 88 S Ct 664, it would be reasonable to consider the strength of the state interest, judged by standards of traditional practice, when deciding how serious a conflict must be shown before declaring the state law preempted. Cf.Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan,325 U.S. 761, 768-769, 89 L. Ed. 1915, 65 S. Ct. 1515 (1945) (under negative Commerce Clause, "reconciliation of the conflicting claims of state and national power is to be attained only by some appraisal and accommodation of the competing demands of the state and national interests involved");  Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United StatesConstitution, at 164 (suggesting a test that "balances the state's interest in a regulation against the impact on U. S. foreign relations"); Maier, Preemption of State Law: A Recommended Analysis, 83 Am. J. Int'l L. 832, 834 (1989) (similar).  Judged by these standards, we think petitioners and the Government have demonstrated a sufficiently clear conflict to require finding preemption here. 

 IV 

A 

 To begin with, resolving Holocaust-era insurance claims that may be held by residents of this country is a matter well within the Executive's responsibility for foreign affairs. Since claims remaining in the aftermath of hostilities may be "sources of friction" acting as an "impediment to resumption of friendly relations" between the countries involved,Pink, supra, at 225, 86 L Ed 796, 62 S Ct 552, there is a "longstanding practice" of the national Executive to settle them in discharging its responsibility to maintain the Nation's relationships with other countries,Dames & Moore, 453 U.S., at 679, 69 L Ed 2d 918, 101 S Ct 2972.  The issue of  restitution for Nazi crimes has in fact been addressed in Executive Branch diplomacy and formalized in treaties and executive agreements over the last half century, and although resolution of private claims was postponed by the Cold War, securing private interests is an express object of diplomacy today, just as it was addressed in agreements soon after the Second World War.  Vindicating victims injured by acts and omissions of enemy corporations in wartime is thus within the traditional subject matter of foreign policy in which national, not state, interests are overriding,  and which the National Government has addressed. 

 The exercise of the federal executive authority means that state law must give way where, as here, there is evidence of clear conflict between the policies adopted by the two.  The foregoing account of negotiations toward the three settlement agreements is enough to illustrate that the consistent Presidential foreign policy has been to encourage European governments and companies to volunteer settlement funds in preference to litigation or coercive sanctions.  See also, e.g., Hearings on H. R. 2693 before the Subcommittee of Government Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations of the House Committee on Government Reform, 107th Cong., 2d Sess., 24 (2002) (statement of Ambassador Randolph M. Bell that it is the "policy of the U. S. Government" "to resolve matters of Holocaust-era restitution and compensation through dialogue, negotiation, and cooperation"); Hearings on the Status of Insurance Restitution for Holocaust Victims and the Heirs before the House Committee on Government Reform 107th Cong., 1st Sess., 77 (2001) (statement of Ambassador J. D. Bindenagel to the same effect).  As for insurance claims in particular,  the national position, expressed unmistakably in the executive agreements signed by the President with Germany and Austria, has been to encourage European insurers to work with the ICHEIC to develop acceptable claim procedures, including procedures governing disclosure of policy information.   See German Foundation Agreement, 39 Int'l Legal Materials, at 1299, 1303 (declaring the German Foundation to be the "exclusive forum" for demands against German companies and agreeing to have insurance claims resolved under procedures developed through negotiation with the ICHEIC); Agreement Relating to the Agreement of October 24, 2000, Concerning the Austrian Fund "Reconciliation, Peace and Cooperation," Jan. 23, 2001, 2001 WL 935261, Annex A, § 2(n) (same for Austria).  This position, of which the agreements are exemplars, has also been consistently supported in the high levels of the Executive Branch, as mentioned already, ante, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 393.  See also, e.g., Hearing before the Committee on House Banking and Financial Services 106th Cong., 2d Sess., 173 (2000) (Deputy Secretary Eizenstat statement that "the U. S. Government has supported [the ICHEIC] since it began, and we believe it should be considered the exclusive remedy for resolving insurance claims from the World War II era"); Hearings on H. R. 2693, at 24 (statement by Ambassador Bell to the same effect); Hearing on the Legacies of the Holocaust before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 106th Cong., 2d Sess., 23 (2000) (Eizenstat testimony that a company's participation in the ICHEIC should give it "'safe haven' from sanctions, subpoenas, and hearings relative to the Holocaust period"). 12 InBarclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal., 512 U.S. 298, 328-330, 129 L. Ed. 2d 244, 114 S. Ct. 2268 (1994), we declined to give policy statements by Executive Branch officials conclusive weight as against an opposing congressional policy in determining whether California's "worldwide combined reporting" tax method violated the Foreign Commerce Clause.  The reason, we said, is that "the Constitution expressly grants Congress, not the President, the power to 'regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.'" Id., at 329, 129 L Ed 2d 244, 114 S Ct 2268 (quoting Art. I, § 8, cl. 3).  As we have discussed, however, in the field of foreign policy the President has the "lead role." First Nat. City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba,406 U.S. 759, 767, 32 L. Ed. 2d 466, 92 S. Ct. 1808 (1972). The approach taken serves to resolve the several competing matters of national concern apparent in the German Foundation Agreement: the national interest in maintaining amicable  relationships with current European allies; survivors' interests in a "fair and prompt" but nonadversarial resolution of their claims so as to "bring some measure of justice . . . in their lifetimes"; and the companies' interest in securing "legal peace" when they settle claims in this fashion.  39 Int'l Legal Materials,  at 1304.  As a way for dealing with insurance claims, moreover, the voluntary scheme protects the companies' ability to abide by their own countries' domestic privacy laws limiting disclosure of policy information.  See Brief for Federal Republic of Germany as Amicus Curiae 12-13. 13 The dissent would discount the executive agreements as evidence of the Government's foreign policy governing disclosure, saying they "do not refer to state disclosure laws specifically, or even to information disclosure generally." Post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 412-413 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  But this assertion gives short shrift to the agreements' express endorsement of the ICHEIC's voluntary mechanism, which encompasses production of policy information, not just actual payment of unpaid claims.  See supra, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 390-391.  The dissent would also dismiss the other Executive Branch expressions of the Government's policy, see supra, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 393, 399-400, insisting on nothing short of a formal statement by the President himself.  See post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 413.  But there is no suggestion that these high-level executive officials were not faithfully representing the President's chosen policy, and there is no apparent reason for adopting the dissent's "nondelegation" rule to apply within the Executive Branch.



 California has taken a different tack of providing regulatory sanctions to compel disclosure and payment, supplemented by a new cause of action for Holocaust survivors if the other sanctions should fail.  The situation created by the California legislation calls to mind the impact of the MassachusettsBurma law on the effective exercise of the President's power, as recounted in the statutory preemption case,Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 120 S. Ct. 2288 (2000).  HVIRA's economic compulsion to make public disclosure, of far more information about far more policies than ICHEIC rules require, employs "a different, state system of economic pressure," and in doing so undercuts the President's  diplomatic discretion and the choice he has made exercising it. Id., at 376, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288.  Whereas the President's authority to provide for settling claims in winding up international hostilities requires flexibility in wielding "the coercive power of the national economy" as a tool of diplomacy,id., at 377, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288, HVIRA denies this, by making exclusion from a large sector of the American insurance market the automatic sanction for noncompliance with the State's own policies on disclosure. "Quite simply, if the [California] law is enforceable the President has less to offer and less economic and diplomatic leverage as a consequence." Ibid. (citingDames & Moore, 453 U.S., at 673, 69 L Ed 2d 918, 101 S Ct 2972).  The law  thus "compromise[s] the very capacity of the President to speak for the Nation with one voice in dealing with other governments" to resolve claims against European companies arising out of World War II. 530 US, at 381, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288. 14 It is true that the President in this case is acting without express congressional authority, and thus does not have the "plenitude of Executive authority" that "controlled the issue of preemption" inCrosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 376, 147 L. Ed. 2d 352, 120 S. Ct. 2288 (2000).  But in Crosby we were careful to note that the President possesses considerable independent constitutional authority to act on behalf of the United States on international issues,id., at 381, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288, and conflict with the exercise of that authority is a comparably good reason to find preemption of state law.

Crosby's facts are replicated again in the way HVIRA threatens to frustrate the operation of the particular  mechanism the President has chosen.  The letters from Deputy Secretary Eizenstat to California officials show well enough how the portent of further litigation and sanctions has in fact placed the Government at a disadvantage in obtaining practical results from persuading "foreign governments and foreign companies to participate voluntarily in organizations such as ICHEIC." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 15; see also SER 1267, 1272 (Joint Statement with Switzerland noting the "potentially disruptive and counterproductive effects" of laws like HVIRA and promising effort by  the United States to call on state legislatures "to refrain from taking unwarranted investigative initiatives or from threatening or actually using sanctions against Swiss insurers").  In addition to thwarting the Government's policy of repose for companies that pay through the ICHEIC, California's indiscriminate disclosure provisions place a handicap on the ICHEIC's effectiveness (and raise a further irritant to the European allies) by undercutting European privacy protections.  See ER 1182,  3131 (opinions of the German Government that public disclosure of all European insurance policies "is not permissible" under German privacy law); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18 (noting protests from the German and Swiss Governments).  It is true, of course, as it is probably true of all elements of HVIRA, that the disclosure requirement's object of obtaining compensation for Holocaust victims is a goal espoused by the National Government as well.  But "the fact of a common end hardly neutralizes conflicting means,"Crosby, supra, at 379, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288, and here HVIRA is an obstacle to the success of the National Government's chosen "calibration of force" in dealing with the Europeans using a voluntary approach, 530 US, at 380, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288. 

B 

The express federal policy and the clear conflict raised by the state statute are alone enough to require state law to yield.  If any doubt about the clarity of the conflict remained, however, it would have to be resolved in the National Government's favor, given the weakness of the State's interest, against the backdrop of traditional state legislative subject matter, in regulating disclosure of European Holocaust-era insurance policies in the manner of HVIRA. 

The commissioner would justify HVIRA's ambitious disclosure requirement as protecting "legitimate consumer protection interests" in knowing which insurers have failed to pay insurance claims.  Brief for Respondent 1, 42-44.  But, quite unlike a generally applicable "blue sky" law, HVIRA  effectively singles out only policies issued by European companies, in Europe, to European residents, at least 55 years ago.  Cal. Ins. Code Ann. § 13804(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2003); see also § 790.15(a) (mandating license suspension only for "failure to pay any valid claim from Holocaust survivors").  Limiting the public disclosure requirement to these policies raises great doubt that the purpose of the California law is an evaluation of corporate reliability in contemporary insuring in the State. 

 Indeed, there is no serious doubt that the state interest actually underlying HVIRA is concern for the  several thousand Holocaust survivors said to be living in the State.  § 13801(d) (legislative finding that roughly 5,600 documented Holocaust survivors reside in California).  But this fact does not displace general standards for evaluating a State's claim to apply its forum law to a particular controversy or transaction, under which the State's claim is not a strong one.  "Even if a plaintiff evidences his desire for forum law by moving to the forum, we have generally accorded such a move little or no significance." Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts,472 U.S. 797, 820, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985); seeAllstate Ins. Co. v. Hague,449 U.S. 302, 311, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (1981)("[A] postoccurrence change of residence to the forum State--standing alone--is insufficient to justify application of forum law"). 

But should the general standard not be displaced, and the State's interest recognized as a powerful one, by virtue of the fact that California seeks to vindicate the claims of Holocaust survivors? The answer lies in recalling that the very same objective dignifies the interest of the National Government in devising its chosen mechanism for voluntary settlements, there being about 100,000 survivors in the country, only a small fraction of them in California.  ER 870 (press release of insurance commissioner of California); Bazyler, 34 Rich. L. Rev., at 8, n 11.  As against the responsibility of the United States of America, the humanity underlying the  state statute could not give the State the benefit of any doubt in resolving the conflict with national policy. 

C 

 The basic fact is that California seeks to use an iron fist where the President has consistently chosen kid gloves.  We have heard powerful arguments that the iron fist would work better, and it may be that if the matter of compensation were considered in isolation from all other issues involving the European allies, the iron fist would be the preferable policy.  But our thoughts on the efficacy of the one approach versus the other are beside the point, since our business is not to judge the wisdom of the National Government's policy; dissatisfaction should be addressed to the President or, perhaps, Congress.  The question relevant to preemption in this case is conflict, and the evidence here is "more than sufficient to demonstrate that the state Act stands in the way of [the President's] diplomatic objectives." Crosby, supra, at 386, 147 L Ed 2d 352, 120 S Ct 2288. 

V 

 The State's remaining submission is that even if HVIRA does interfere with Executive Branch foreign policy, Congress authorized state law of this sort in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 59 Stat 33, ch 20, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1011 -1015,[15 USCS §§ 1011-1015]  and the more recent U. S.Holocaust Assets Commission Act of 1998 (Holocaust Commission Act), 112 Stat 611, note following 22 USC § 1621 [22 USCS § 1621].  There is, however, no need to consider the possible significance for preemption doctrine of tension between an Act of Congress and Presidential foreign policy, cf. generallyYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,343 U.S., at 637-638, 96 L Ed 1153, 72 S Ct 863 (Jackson, J., concurring  in judgment and opinion of Court), for neither statute does the job the commissioner ascribes to it. 

 The provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act said to be relevant here specify that "the business of insurance" shall be recognized as a subject of state regulation, 15 U.S.C. § 1012(a) [15 USCS § 1012(a)],  which will be good against preemption by federal legislation unless that legislation "specifically relates to the business of insurance," § 1012(b); see also § 1011 (policy behind § 1012 is that "continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in the public interest" and "silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or taxation of such business by the several States").  As the text itself makes clear, the point of McCarran-Ferguson's legislative choice of leaving insurance regulation generally to the States was to limit congressional preemption under the commerce power, whether dormant or exercised.  ComparePrudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,328 U.S. 408, 429-430, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946), with United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Ass'n, 322 U.S. 533, 88 L. Ed. 1440, 64 S. Ct. 1162 (1944); seeDepartment of Treasury v. Fabe,508 U.S. 491, 499-500, 124 L. Ed. 2d 449, 113 S. Ct. 2202 (1993).  Quite apart, then, from any doubt whether HVIRA would qualify as regulating "the business of insurance" given its tangential relation to present-day insuring in the State, seeFTC v. Travelers Health Assn.,362 U.S. 293, 300-301, 4 L. Ed. 2d 724, 80 S. Ct. 717 (1960) (McCarran-Ferguson was not intended to allow a State to "regulate activities carried on beyond its own borders"), a federal statute directed to implied preemption by domestic commerce legislation cannot sensibly be construed to address preemption by executive conduct in foreign affairs. 

 Nor does the Holocaust Commission Act authorize HVIRA.  That Act set up a Presidential Commission to "study and develop a historical record of the collection and disposition" of Holocaust era assets that "came into the possession or control of the Federal Government." Pub L 105-186, § 3(a)(1), 112 Stat 612.  For this purpose, Congress directed the Commission to "encourage the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to prepare a report on the Holocaust-related claims practices of all insurance companies, both domestic and foreign, doing business in the United States at any time after January 30, 1933, that issued any individual life, health, or property-casualty insurance policy to any individual on any list of Holocaust victims." § 3(a)(4)(A), 112 Stat 613.  These provisions are no help to HVIRA.  The Commission's focus was limited to assets in the possession of the Government, and if anything, the federal Act assumed it was the National Government's responsibility to deal with returning those assets.  See § 3(d), 112 Stat 614 (President to collect recommendations from the commission and submit a suggested plan for "legislative, administrative, or other action" to Congress).  In any event, the federal Act's reference to the state insurance commissioners as compiling information was expressly limited "to the degree the information is available," § 3(a)(4)(B), 112 Stat 613, a proviso that can hardly be read to condone state sanctions  interfering with federal efforts to resolve such claims. 

 Indeed, it is worth noting that Congress has done nothing to express disapproval of the President's policy.  Legislation along the lines of HVIRA has been introduced in Congress repeatedly, but none of the bills has come close to making it into law.  See H. R. 1210, 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003); S. 972, 108th Cong., 1st Sess. (2003); H. R. 2693, 107th Cong., 1st Sess. (2001); H. R. 126, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999). 

 In sum, Congress has not acted on the matter addressed here.  Given the President's independent authority "in the areas of foreign policy and national security, . . . congressional silence is not to be equated with congressional disapproval." Haig v. Agee,453 U.S. 280, 291, 69 L. Ed. 2d 640, 101 S. Ct. 2766 (1981). 

VI 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed. 

So ordered.  


Justice Breyer announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join. 

This case concerns contracts between a commercial lender and its customers, each of which contains a clause providing for arbitration of all contract-related disputes. The Supreme Court of South Carolina held (1) that the arbitration clauses are silent as to whether arbitration might take the form of class arbitration, and (2) that, in that circumstance, South Carolina law interprets the contracts as permitting class arbitration. 351 S.C. 244, 569 S.E.2d 349 (2002).  We granted certiorari to determine whether this holding is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. [9 U.S.C.S. §§ 1et seq.]

We are faced at the outset with a problem concerning the contracts' silence.  Are the contracts in fact silent, or do they forbid class arbitration as petitioner Green Tree Financial Corp. contends?  Given the South Carolina Supreme Court's holding,  it is important to resolve that question.  But we cannot do so, not simply because it is a matter of state law, but also because it is a matter for the arbitrator to decide.  Because the record suggests that the parties have not yet received an arbitrator's decision on that question of contract interpretation, we vacate the judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court and remand the case so that this question may be resolved in arbitration. 

I 

In 1995, respondents Lynn and  Burt  Bazzle secured a home improvement loan from petitioner Green Tree.  The  Bazzles and Green Tree entered into a contract, governed by South Carolina law, which included the following arbitration clause: "ARBITRATION--All disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract . . . shall be resolved by binding arbitration by one arbitrator selected by us with consent of you. This arbitration contract is made pursuant to a transaction in interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. section 1 [9 U.S.C.S. § 1] . . . .  THE PARTIES VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL, EITHER PURSUANT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS CLAUSE OR PURSUANT TO COURT ACTION BY US (AS PROVIDED HEREIN).  . . .  The parties agree and understand that the arbitrator shall have all powers provided by the law and the contract.  These powers shall include all legal and equitable remedies, including, but not limited to, money damages, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief." App. 34 (emphasis added, capitalization in original).

Respondents Daniel Lackey and George and Florine  Buggs entered into loan contracts and security agreements for the purchase of mobile homes with Green Tree.  These agreements contained arbitration clauses that were, in all relevant respects, identical to the Bazzles' arbitration clause. (Their contracts substitute the word "you" with the word "Buyer[s]" in the italicized phrase.)  351 S.C., at 264, n. 18, 569 S.E.2d, at 359, n. 18 (emphasis deleted). 

At the time of the loan transactions, Green Tree apparently failed to provide these customers with a legally required form that would have told them that they had a right to name their own lawyers and insurance agents and would have provided space for them to write in those names.  See  S.C. Code Ann. § 37-10-102 (West 2002).  The two sets of customers before us now as respondents each filed separate actions in South Carolina state courts, complaining that this failure violated South Carolina law and seeking damages. 

In April 1997, the Bazzles asked the court to certify their claims as a class action. Green Tree sought to stay the court proceedings and compel arbitration. On January 5, 1998, the court both (1) certified a class action and (2) entered an order compelling  arbitration. App. 7.  Green Tree then selected an arbitrator with the Bazzles' consent.  And the arbitrator, administering the proceeding as a class arbitration, eventually awarded the class $10,935,000 in statutory damages, along with attorney's fees.  The trial court confirmed the award, App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-35a, and Green Tree appealed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals claiming, among other things, that class arbitration was legally impermissible. 

Lackey and the Buggses had earlier begun a similar court proceeding in which they, too, sought class certification. Green Tree moved to compel arbitration. The trial court initially denied the motion, finding the arbitration agreement unenforceable, but Green Tree pursued an interlocutory appeal and the State Court of Appeals  reversed. Lackey v. Green Tree Financial Corp.,330 S.C. 388, 498 S.E.2d 898 (1998).  The parties then chose an arbitrator, indeed the same arbitrator who was subsequently selected to arbitrate the Bazzles' dispute. 

In December 1998, the arbitrator certified a class in arbitration. App. 18.  The arbitrator proceeded to hear the matter, ultimately ruled in favor of the class, and awarded  the class $9,200,000 in statutory damages in addition to attorney's fees.  The trial court confirmed the award.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-54a.  Green Tree appealed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals claiming, among other things, that class arbitration was legally impermissible. 

 The South Carolina Supreme Court withdrew both cases from the Court of Appeals, assumed jurisdiction, and consolidated the proceedings.  351 S.C., at 249, 569 S.E.2d, at 351.  That court then held that the contracts were silent in respect to class arbitration, that they consequently authorized class arbitration, and that arbitration had properly taken that form.  We granted certiorari to consider whether that holding is consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act. 

II 

The South Carolina Supreme Court's determination that the contracts are silent in respect to class arbitration raises a preliminary question.  Green Tree argued there, as it argues here, that the contracts are not silent--that they forbid class arbitration. And we must deal with that argument at the outset, for if it is right, then the South Carolina court's holding is flawed on its own terms; that court neither said nor implied  that it would have authorized class arbitration had the parties' arbitration agreement forbidden it. 

Whether Green Tree is right about the contracts themselves presents a disputed issue of contract interpretation. The Chief Justice believes that Green Tree is right; indeed, that Green Tree is so clearly right that we should ignore the fact that state law, not federal law, normally governs such matters, see post, at 156 L. Ed. 2d at 424, 123 S. Ct. 2402 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), and reverse the South Carolina Supreme Court outright, see post, at 156 L. Ed. 2d, at 427 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting).  The Chief Justice points out that the contracts say that disputes "shall be resolved . . . by one arbitrator selected by us [Green Tree] with consent of you [Green Tree's customer]." App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a.  See post, at 156 L. Ed. 2d, at 425.  And it finds that class arbitration is clearly inconsistent with this requirement.  After all, class arbitration involves an arbitration, not simply between Green Tree and a named customer, but also between Green Tree and other (represented) customers, all taking place before the  arbitrator chosen to arbitrate the initial, named customer's dispute. 

We  do not believe, however, that the contracts' language is as clear as The Chief Justice believes.  The class arbitrator was "selected by" Green Tree "with consent of" Green Tree's customers, the named plaintiffs.  And insofar as the other class members agreed to proceed in class arbitration, they consented as well. 

Of course, Green Tree did not independently  select this arbitrator to arbitrate its disputes with the other class members.  But whether the contracts contain this additional requirement is a question that the literal terms of the contracts do not decide.  The contracts simply say (I) "selected by us [Green Tree]." And that is literally what occurred.  The contracts do not say (II) "selected by us [Green Tree] to arbitrate this dispute and no other (even identical) dispute with another customer." The question whether (I) in fact implicitly means (II) is the question at issue: Do the contracts forbid class arbitration? Given the broad authority the contracts elsewhere bestow upon the arbitrator, see, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a (the contracts grant to the arbitrator "all powers," including certain equitable powers "provided by the law and the contract"),  the answer to this question is not completely obvious. 

 At the same time, we cannot automatically accept the South Carolina Supreme Court's resolution of this contract-interpretation question.  Under the terms of the parties' contracts, the question--whether the agreement forbids class arbitration--is for the arbitrator to decide.  The parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator "all disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract." Ibid. (emphasis added).  And the dispute about what the arbitration contract in each case means (i.e., whether it forbids the use of class arbitration procedures) is a dispute "relating to this contract" and the resulting "relationships." Hence the  parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator, not a judge, would answer the relevant question.  SeeFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,514 U.S. 938, 943, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985, 115 S. Ct. 1920 (1995) (arbitration is a "matter of contract").  And if there is doubt about that matter--about the "'scope of arbitrable issues'"--we should resolve that doubt "'in favor of arbitration.'" Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,473 U.S. 614, 626, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444, 105 S. Ct. 3346 (1985)  . 

In certain limited circumstances, courts assume that the parties intended courts, not arbitrators, to decide a particular arbitration-related matter (in the absence of "clear and unmistakable" evidence to the contrary). AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers,475 U.S. 643, 649, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648, 106 S. Ct. 1415 (1986).  These limited instances typically involve matters of a kind that "contracting parties would likely have expected a court" to decide. Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,537 U.S. 79, 83, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491, 123 S. Ct. 588 (2002).  They include certain gateway matters, such as whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all or whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy.  See generallyHowsam, supra.See alsoJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston,376 U.S. 543, 546-547, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898, 84 S. Ct. 909 (1964) (whether an arbitration agreement survives a corporate merger);AT&T, supra, at 651-652, 89 L. Ed. 2d 648, 106 S. Ct. 1415 (whether a labor-management layoff controversy falls within the scope of an arbitration clause). 

The question here--whether  the contracts forbid class arbitration--does not fall into this narrow exception.  It concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability  to the underlying dispute between the parties.  Unlike First Options, the question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate a matter.514 U.S., at 942-945, 131 L. Ed. 2d 985, 115 S. Ct. 1920.  Rather the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.  That question does not concern a state statute or judicial procedures, cf.Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford  Junior Univ.,489 U.S. 468, 474-476, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488, 109 S. Ct. 1248 (1989).  It concerns contract interpretation and arbitration procedures.  Arbitrators are well situated to answer that question.  Given these considerations, along with the arbitration contracts' sweeping language concerning the scope of the questions committed to arbitration, this matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator, not the courts, to decide.  Cf.Howsam, supra, at 83, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491, 123 S. Ct. 588 (finding for roughly similar reasons that the arbitrator  should determine a certain procedural "gateway matter"). 

III 

With respect to this underlying question--whether the arbitration contracts forbid class arbitration--the parties have not yet obtained the arbitration decision that their contracts foresee.  As far as concerns the Bazzle plaintiffs, the South Carolina Supreme Court wrote that the "trial court" issued "an order granting class certification" and the arbitrator subsequently "administered" class arbitration  proceedings "without further involvement of the trial court."  351 S.C., at 250-251, 569 S.E.2d, at 352.  Green Tree adds that "the class arbitration was imposed on the parties and the arbitrator by the South Carolina trial court." Brief for Petitioner 30.  Respondents now deny that this was so, Brief for Respondents 13, but we can find no convincing record support for that denial. 

As far as concerns the Lackey plaintiffs, what happened in arbitration is less clear.  On the one hand, the Lackey arbitrator (the same individual who later arbitrated the Bazzle dispute) wrote: "I determined that a class action should proceed in arbitration based upon my careful review of the broadly  drafted arbitration clause prepared by Green Tree." App. to Pet. for Cert. 84a (emphasis added).  And respondents suggested at oral argument that the arbitrator's decision was independently made.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39. 

On the other hand, the Lackey arbitrator decided this question after the South Carolina trial court had determined  that the identical contract in the Bazzle case authorized class arbitration procedures.  And there is no question that the arbitrator was aware of the Bazzle decision, since the Lackey plaintiffs had argued to the arbitrator that it should impose class arbitration procedures in part because the state trial court in Bazzle had done so.  Record on Appeal 516-518.  In the court proceedings below (where Green Tree took the opposite position), the Lackey plaintiffs maintained that "to the extent" the arbitrator decided that the contracts permitted class procedures (in the Lackey case or the Bazzle case), "it was a reaffirmation and/or adoption of [the Bazzle c]ourt's prior determination." Record on Appeal 1708, n 2.  See also App. 31-32, n 2. 

On balance, there is at least a  strong likelihood in Lackey as well as in Bazzle  that the arbitrator's decision reflected a court's interpretation of the contracts rather than an arbitrator's interpretation.  That being so, we remand the case so that the arbitrator may decide the question of contract interpretation--thereby enforcing the parties' arbitration agreements according to their terms.  9 U.S.C. § 2 [9 U.S.C.S. § 2];Volt, supra, at 478-479, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488, 109 S. Ct. 1248. 

The judgment of the South Carolina Supreme Court is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings so ordered.  


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 California has brought a criminal prosecution after expiration of the time periods set forth in previously applicable  statutes of limitations.  California has done so under the authority of a new law that (1) permits resurrection of otherwise time-barred criminal prosecutions, and (2) was itself enacted after pre-existing limitations periods had expired. We conclude that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I, § 10, cl. 1, bars application of this new law to the present case. 

I 

 In 1993, California enacted a new criminal statute of limitations governing sex-related child abuse crimes.  The new statute permits prosecution for those crimes where "[t]he limitation period specified in [prior statutes of limitations] has expired"--provided that (1) a victim has reported an allegation of abuse to the police, (2) "there is independent evidence that clearly and convincingly corroborates the victim's allegation," and (3) the prosecution is begun within one year of the victim's report.  1993 Cal. Stats. ch. 390, § 1 (codified as amended at Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 803(g) (West Supp. 2003)).  A related provision, added to the statute in 1996, makes clear that a prosecution satisfying these three conditions "shall revive any cause of action barred by [prior statutes of limitations]." 1996 Cal.  Stats. ch. 130, § 1 (codified at Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 803(g)(3)(A) (West Supp. 2003)).  The statute thus authorizes prosecution for criminal acts committed many years beforehand--and where the original limitations period has expired--as long as prosecution  begins within a year of a victim's first complaint to the police. 

In 1998, a California grand jury indicted Marion Stogner, the petitioner, charging him with sex-related child abuse committed decades earlier--between 1955 and 1973.  Without  the new statute allowing revival of the State's cause of action, California could not have prosecuted Stogner.  The statute of limitations governing prosecutions at the time the crimes were allegedly committed had set forth a 3-year limitations period. And that period had run 22 years or more before the present prosecution was brought. 

Stogner moved for the complaint's dismissal.  He argued that the Federal Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause, Art. I, § 10, cl. 1, forbids revival of a previously time-barred prosecution.  The trial court agreed that such a revival is unconstitutional.  But the California Court of Appeal reversed, citing a recent, contrary decision by theCalifornia Supreme Court, People v. Frazer,21 Cal. 4th 737, 982 P.2d 180, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 312 (1999), cert denied, 529 U.S. 1108, 146 L. Ed. 2d 792, 120 S. Ct. 1960 (2000).  Stogner then moved to dismiss his indictment, arguing that his prosecution is unconstitutional under both the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Due Process Clause, Amdt. 14, § 1.  The trial court denied Stogner's motion, and the Court of Appeal upheld that denial. Stogner v. Superior Court,93 Cal. App. 4th 1229, 114 Cal.Rptr.2d 37 (2001).  We granted certiorari to consider Stogner's constitutional claims.  537 U.S. 1043, 537 U.S. 1043, 154 L. Ed. 2d 514, 123 S. Ct. 658 (2002). 

II 

 The Constitution's two Ex Post Facto Clauses prohibit the Federal Government and the States from enacting laws with certain retroactive effects.  See Art. I, § 9, cl. 3 (Federal Government); Art. I, § 10, cl. 1 (States).  The law at issue here created a new criminal limitations period that extends the time in which prosecution is allowed.  It authorized criminal prosecutions that the passage of time had previously barred.  Moreover, it was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Do these features of the law, taken together, produce the kind  of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids? We conclude that they do. 

  First, the new statute threatens the kinds of harm that, in this Court's view, the Ex Post Facto Clause seeks to avoid.  Long ago the Court pointed out that the Clause protects liberty by preventing governments from enacting statutes with "manifestly unjust and oppressive" retroactive effects. Calder v. Bull,3 U.S. 386, 3 Dallas 386, 1 L. Ed. 648 (1798).  Judge Learned Hand later wrote that extending a limitations period after the State has assured "a man that he has become safe from its pursuit . . . seems to most of us unfair and dishonest." Falter v. United States,23 F.2d 420, 426 (CA2) , cert denied, 277 U.S. 590, 72 L. Ed. 1003, 48 S. Ct. 528 (1928).  In such a case, the government has refused "to play by its own rules,"Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 533, 146 L. Ed. 2d 577, 120 S. Ct. 1620 (2000).  It has deprived the defendant of the "fair warning,"Weaver v. Graham,450 U.S. 24, 28, 67 L. Ed. 2d 17, 101 S. Ct. 960 (1981), that might have led him to preserve exculpatory evidence.  F. Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 316, p 210 (8th ed. 1880) ("The statute [of limitations] is . . . an amnesty, declaring that  after a certain time . . . the offender shall be at liberty to return to his country . . . and . . . may cease to preserve the proofs of his innocence").  And a Constitution that permits such an extension, by allowing legislatures to pick and choose when to act retroactively, risks both "arbitrary and potentially vindictive legislation," and erosion of the separation of powers,Weaver, supra, at 29, and n 10, 450 U.S. 24, 67 L Ed 2d 17, 101 S Ct 960.  SeeFletcher v. Peck,10 U.S. 87, 6 Cranch 87, 137-138, 3 L. Ed. 162 (1810) (viewing the Ex Post Facto Clause as a protection against "violent acts which might grow out of the feelings of the moment"). 

 Second, the kind of statute at issue falls literally within the categorical descriptions of ex post facto laws set forth by Justice Chase more than 200 years ago inCalder v. Bull, supra --a categorization that this Court has recognized as providing an authoritative account of the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause. Collins v. Youngblood,497 U.S. 37, 46, 111 L. Ed. 2d 30, 110 S. Ct. 2715 (1990);Carmell, supra, at 539, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620.  Drawing substantially on Richard Wooddeson's 18th-century commentary on the nature of ex post facto laws and past parliamentary abuses,  Chase divided ex post facto laws into categories that he described in two alternative ways.  See529 U.S., at 522-524, and n 9, 529 U.S. 513, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620.  He wrote: "I will state what laws I consider ex post facto laws, within the words and the intent of the prohibition.  1st.  Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action.  2d.  Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d.  Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.  4th.  Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender. All these, and similar laws, are manifestly unjust and oppressive." Calder, supra, at 390-391, 1 L Ed 648 (emphasis altered from original).

In his alternative description, Chase traced these four categories back to Parliament's earlier abusive acts, as follows: Category 1: "Sometimes they respected the crime, by declaring acts  to be treason, which were not treason, when committed." Category 2: "[A]t other times they inflicted punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment."Category 3: "[I]n other cases, they inflicted greater punishment, than the law annexed to the offence." Category 4: "[A]t other times, they violated the rules of evidence (to supply a deficiency of legal proof) by admitting one witness, when the existing law required two; by receiving evidence without oath; or the oath of the wife against the husband; or other testimony, which the courts of justice would not admit."3 Dall., at 389, 1 L Ed 648 (emphasis altered from original).

 The second category--including any "law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when  committed,"id., at 390, 1 L Ed 648 --describes California's statute as long as those words are understood as Justice Chase understood them--i.e., as referring to a statute that "inflict[s]punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any  punishment,"id., at 389, 1 L Ed 648.  See also 2 R. Wooddeson, A Systematical View of the Laws of England 638 (1792) (hereinafter Wooddeson,  Systematical View) (discussing the ex post facto status of a law that affects punishment by "making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law" (emphasis added)).  After (but not before) the original statute of limitations had expired, a party such as Stogner was not "liable to any punishment." California's new statute therefore "aggravated" Stogner's alleged crime, or made it "greater than it was, when committed," in the sense that, and to the extent that, it "inflicted punishment" for past criminal conduct that (when the new law was enacted) did not trigger any such liability.  See also H. Black, American Constitutional Law § 266, p 700 (4th ed. 1927) (hereinafter Black, American Constitutional Law) ("[A]n act condoned by the expiration of the statute of limitations is no longer a punishable offense").  It is consequently not surprising that New Jersey's highest court long ago recognized that Chase's alternative description of second category laws "exactly describes the operation" of the kind of statute at issue here. Moore v. State,43 N. J. L. 203, 217 (1881) (emphasis added).  See  also H. Black, Constitutional Prohibitions Against Legislation Impairing the Obligation of Contracts, and Against Retroactive and Ex Post Facto Laws § 235, p 298 (1887) (hereinafter Black, Constitutional Prohibitions) ("Such a statute" "certainly makes that a punishable offense which was previously a condoned and obliterated offense"). 

 So to understand the second category (as applying where a new law inflicts a punishment upon a person not then subject  to that punishment, to any degree) explains why and how that category differs from both the first category (making criminal noncriminal behavior) and the third category (aggravating the punishment).  And this understanding is consistent, in relevant part, with Chase's second category examples--examples specifically provided to illustrate Chase's alternative description of laws "'inflict[ing]punishments, where the party was not, by law, liable to any punishment,'"Calder, supra, at 389, 1 L Ed 648. 

Following Wooddeson, Chase cited as examples of such laws Acts of Parliament that banished certain individuals accused of treason.  3 Dall., at 389, and n†, 1 L Ed 648; see alsoCarmell, 529 U.S., at 522-524, and n 11, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620.  Both Chase and Wooddeson explicitly referred to these laws as involving "banishment." Calder, supra, at 389, and n†, 1 L Ed 648; 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638-639.  This fact was significant because Parliament had enacted those laws not only after the crime's commission, but under circumstances where banishment "was simply not a form of penalty that could be imposed by the courts." Carmell, supra, at 523, n. 11, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620; see also 11 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 569 (1938).  Thus, these laws, like the California law at issue here, enabled punishment where it  was not otherwise available "in the ordinary course of law," 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638.  As this Court previously recognized inCarmell, supra, at 523, and n 11, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620, it was this vice that was relevant to Chase's purpose. 

 It is true, however, that Parliament's Acts of banishment, unlike the law in this case, involved a punishment (1) that the legislature imposed directly, and (2) that courts had never previously had the power to impose.  But these differences are not determinative.  The first describes not a retroactivity problem but an attainder problem that Justice Chase's  language does not emphasize and with which the Constitution separately deals, Art. I, § 9, cl. 3; Art. I, § 10, cl. 1.  The second difference seems beside the point.  The example of  Parliament's banishment laws points to concern that a legislature, knowing the  accused and seeking to have the accused punished for a pre-existing crime, might enable punishment of the accused in ways that existing law forbids. That fundamental concern, related to basic concerns about retroactive penal laws and erosion of the separation of powers, applies with equal force to punishment like that enabled by California's law as applied to Stogner--punishment that courts lacked the power to impose at the time the legislature acted.  See Black, Constitutional Prohibitions § 235, at 298 ("It would be superfluous to point out that such an act [reviving otherwise time-barred criminal liability] would fall within the evils intended to be guarded against by the prohibition in question").  Cf. 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law § 444a, pp 347-348, n b (rev. 7th ed. 1874) (hereinafter Criminal Law). 

 In finding that California's law falls within the literal terms of Justice Chase's second category, we do not deny that it may fall within another category as well.  Justice Chase's fourth category, for example, includes any "law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender." Calder, supra, at 390, 1 L Ed 648.  This Court has described that category as including laws that diminish "the quantum of evidence required to convict." Carmell, supra, at 532, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620. 

Significantly, a statute of limitations reflects a legislative judgment that, after a certain time, no quantum of evidence is sufficient to convict.  SeeUnited States v. Marion,404 U.S. 307, 322, 30 L. Ed. 2d 468, 92 S. Ct. 455 (1971).  And that judgment typically rests, in large part, upon evidentiary concerns--for example, concern that the passage of time has eroded memories or made witnesses or other evidence unavailable. United States v. Kubrick,444 U.S. 111, 117, 62 L. Ed. 2d 259, 100 S. Ct. 352 (1979); 4 W. LaFave, J. Israel, & N. King, Criminal Procedure § 18.5(a), p 718 (1999); Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 316, at 210.  Indeed, this  Court once described statutes of limitations  as creating "a presumption which renders proof unnecessary." Wood v. Carpenter,101 U.S. 135, 139, 25 L. Ed. 807 (1879). 

Consequently, to resurrect a prosecution after the relevant statute of limitations has expired is to eliminate a currently existing conclusive presumption forbidding prosecution, and thereby to permit conviction on a quantum of evidence where that  quantum, at the time the new law is enacted, would have been legally insufficient.  And, in that sense, the new law would "violate" previous evidence-related legal rules by authorizing the courts to "'receiv[e] evidence . . . which the courts of justice would not [previously have] admit[ted]'" as sufficient proof of a crime, supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 552-553, 123 S. Ct. 2446.  Cf.Collins, 497 U.S., at 46, 111 L Ed 2d 30, 110 S Ct 2715 ("Subtle ex post facto violations are no more permissible than overt ones");Cummings v. Missouri,71 U.S. 277, 4 Wall. 277, 329, 18 L. Ed. 356 (1867) (The Ex Post Facto Clause "cannot be evaded by the form in which the power of the State is exerted").  Nonetheless, given Justice Chase's description of the second category, we need not explore the fourth category, or other categories, further. 

 Third, likely for the reasons just stated,  numerous legislators, courts, and commentators have long believed it well settled that the Ex Post Facto Clause forbids resurrection of a time-barred prosecution.  Such sentiments appear already to have been widespread when the Reconstruction Congress of 1867--the Congress that drafted the Fourteenth Amendment --rejected a bill that would have revived time-barred prosecutions for treason that various Congressmen wanted brought against Jefferson Davis and "his coconspirators," Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 2d Sess., 279 (1866-1867) (comments of Rep. Lawrence).  Radical Republicans such as Roscoe Conkling and Thaddeus Stevens, no friends of the South, opposed the bill because,  in their minds, it proposed an "ex post facto law," id., at 68 (comments of Rep. Conkling), and threatened an injustice tantamount to "judicial murder," id., at 69 (comments of Rep. Stevens).  In this instance, Congress  ultimately passed a law extending unexpired limitations periods, ch 236, 15 Stat 183--a tailored approach to extending limitations periods that has also been taken in modern statutes, e.g.,18 USC § 3293 [18 USCS § 3293] (notes on effective date of 1990 amendment  and effect of 1989 amendment); Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 805.5 (West Supp. 2003). 

Further, Congressmen such as Conkling were not the only ones who believed that laws reviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto.That view was echoed in roughly contemporaneous opinions by State Supreme Courts. E.g.,State v. Sneed,25 Tex. 66, 25 Tex. Supp. 66, 67 (1860);Moore,43 N. J. L., at 216-217.  Cf.State v. Keith,63 N. C. 140, 145 (1869) (A State's repeal of an amnesty was "substantially an ex post facto law").  Courts, with apparent unanimity until California's decision inFrazer, have continued to state such views, and, when necessary, so to hold.  E.g.,People ex rel. Reibman v. Warden,242 A. D. 282, 285, 275 N. Y. S. 59, 62 (App. Div. 1934);United States v. Fraidin,63 F. Supp. 271, 276 (Md. 1945);People v. Shedd,702 P.2d 267, 268 (Colo. 1985) (en banc) (per curiam);State v. Hodgson,108 Wash. 2d 662, 667-669, 740 P.2d 848, 851-852 (1987) (en banc), cert denied, 485 U.S. 938, 99 L. Ed. 2d 277, 108 S. Ct. 1117 (1988);Commonwealth v. Rocheleau,404 Mass. 129, 130-131, 533 N.E.2d 1333, 1334 (1989);State v. Nunn,244 Kan. 207, 218, 768 P.2d 268, 277-278 (1989);State v. O'Neill,118 Idaho 244, 247, 796 P.2d 121, 124 (1990);State v. Hirsch,245 Neb. 31, 39-40, 511 N.W.2d 69, 76 (1994);State v. Schultzen,522 N.W.2d 833, 835 (Iowa 1994);State v. Comeau,142 N. H. 84, 88, 697 A.2d 497, 500 (1997) (citingState v.  Hamel,138 N. H. 392, 395-396, 643 A.2d 953, 955-956 (1994));Santiago v. Commonwealth,428 Mass. 39, 42, 697 N.E.2d 979, 981, cert denied, 525 U.S. 1003, 142 L. Ed. 2d 426, 119 S. Ct. 514 (1998).  Cf.Thompson v. State,54 Miss. 740, 743 (1877) (stating, without specifying further grounds, that a new law could not take away a vested statute-of-limitations defense);State v. Cookman, 127 Ore. App. 283, 289, 873 P.2d 335, 338 (1994) (holding that a law resurrecting a time-barred criminal  case "violates the Due Process Clause"), aff'd on state-law grounds,324 Ore. 19, 920 P.2d 1086 (1996);Commonwealth v. Guimento,341 Pa. Super. 95, 97-98, 491 A.2d 166, 167-168 (1985) (enforcing  a state ban on ex post facto laws apparently equivalent to the federal prohibition);People v. Chesebro,185 Mich. App. 412, 416, 463 N.W.2d 134, 135-136 (1990) (reciting "the general rule" that, "'where a complete defense has arisen under [a statute of limitations], it cannot be taken away by a subsequent repeal thereof'"). 

Even where courts have upheld extensions of unexpired statutes of limitations (extensions that our holding today does not affect, see supra, at ____- ____ , 156 L Ed 2d, at 552-553), they have consistently distinguished situations where limitations periods have expired.Further, they have often done so by saying that extension of existing limitations periods is not ex post facto "provided," "so long as," "because," or "if" the prior limitations periods have not expired--a manner of speaking that suggests a presumption that revival of time-barred criminal cases is not allowed. E.g.,United States v. Madia,955 F.2d 538, 540 (CA8 1992) ("'provided'");United States v. Richardson,512 F.2d 105, 106 (CA3 1975) ("provided");People v. Anderson,53 Ill. 2d 437, 440, 292 N.E.2d 364, 366 (1973) ("so long as");United States v. Haug,21 F.R.D. 22, 25 (ND Ohio 1957) ("so long as"), aff'd,274 F.2d 885 (CA6 1960), cert denied, 365 US 811, 5 L Ed 2d 691, 81 S Ct 688 (1961); United States v. Kurzenknabe,136 F. Supp. 17, 23 (NJ 1955) ("so long as");State v. Duffy,2000 MT 186, 300 Mont. 381, 390, 6 P.3d 453, 460 (2000) ("because");State v. Davenport,536 N.W.2d 686, 688 (N. D. 1995) ("because"); Andrews v. State,392 So. 2d 270, 271 (Fla. App. 1980) ("if"), review denied,399 So. 2d 1145 (1981).  See, e.g.,Shedd, supra, at 268 (citingRichardson, supra, andAndrews, supra, as directly supporting a conclusion that a law reviving time-barred offenses is ex post facto).Cf.Commonwealth v. Duffy,96 Pa. 506, 514 (1880) ("[I]n any case where a right to acquittal has not been absolutely acquired by the completion of the period of limitation, that period  is subject to enlargement or repeal without being obnoxious to the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws"). 

Given the apparent unanimity  of pre-Frazer case law, legal scholars have long had reason to believe this matter settled.  As early as 1887, Henry Black reported that, although "not at all numerous," the "cases upon this point . . . unmistakably point to the conclusion that such an act would be ex post facto in the strict sense, and void." Constitutional Prohibitions § 235, at 297.  Even earlier, in 1874, Francis Wharton supported this conclusion by emphasizing the historic role of statutes of limitations as "acts of grace or oblivion, and not of process," "extinguish[ing] all future prosecution" and making an offense unable to "be  again called into existence at the caprice of the prince." 1 Criminal Law § 444a, at 347-348, n b. More modern commentators--reporting on the same and subsequent cases--have come to the same conclusion.  E.g.,21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law § 294, pp 349-350 (1998 and Supp. 2002); 16A C. J. S., Constitutional Law § 420, p 372 (1984 and Supp 2002); 4 LaFave, Israel, & King, Criminal Procedure § 18.5(a), at 718, n 6; 2 C. Antieau & W. Rich, Modern Constitutional Law § 38.11, p 445 (2d ed. 1997); Adlestein, Conflict of the Criminal Statute of Limitations with  Lesser Offenses at Trial,37 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 246 (1995); C. Corman, Limitation of Actions § 1.6, p 35 (1993 Supp.); F. Black, Statutes of Limitations and the Ex Post Facto Clauses,26 Ky. L. J. 42 (1937); Black, American Constitutional Law § 266, at 700.  Cf. H. Wood, Limitation of Actions § 13, p 43 (3d ed. 1901) (The State "may be said" to be "estopped from prosecuting").  Likewise, with respect to the closely related case of a law repealing an amnesty--a case not distinguished by the dissent--William Wade concluded early on that "[s]uch an act would be as clearly in contravention of the inhibition of ex post facto laws as though it undertook to annex criminality to an act innocent when done." Operation and Construction of Retroactive Laws § 286, p 339 (1880).  But cf. post, at ____, 156 L. Ed. 2d, at 569 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). 

This Court itself has not previously spoken decisively on this matter.  On the one hand, it has clearly stated that the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination does not apply after the relevant limitations period has expired. Brown v. Walker,161 U.S. 591, 597-598, 40 L. Ed. 819, 16 S. Ct. 644 (1896).  And that rule may suggest that  the expiration of a statute of limitations is irrevocable, for otherwise the passage of time would not have eliminated fear of prosecution. 

On the other hand, inStewart v. Kahn,78 U.S. 493, 11 Wall. 493, 20 L. Ed. 176 (1871), this Court upheld a statute, enacted during the Civil War, that retroactively tolled all civil and criminal limitations for periods during which the war had made service of process impossible or courts inaccessible. Stewart, however, involved a civil, not a criminal, limitations statute. Id., at 500-501.  Significantly, in reviewing this civil case, the Court upheld the statute as an exercise of Congress' war powers,id., at 507, 20 L Ed 176, without explicit consideration of any potential collision with the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Moreover, the Court already had held, independent of Congress' Act, that statutes of limitations were tolled for "the time during which the courts in the States lately in rebellion were closed to the citizens of the loyal States." Id., at 503, 20 L Ed 176; see alsoHanger v. Abbott,73 U.S. 532, 6 Wall. 532, 539-542, 18 L. Ed. 939 (1868).  Hence,  the Court could have seen the relevant statute as ratifying  a pre-existing expectation of tolling due to wartime exigencies, rather than as extending limitations periods that had truly expired. Seeid., at 541, 18 L Ed 939; see alsoStewart, supra, at 507, 20 L Ed 176.  In our view, Stewart therefore no more dictates the outcome here than does seemingly contrary precedent regarding the Fifth Amendment privilege. 

Instead, we believe that the outcome of this case is determined by the nature of the harms that California's law creates, by the fact that the  law falls within Justice Chase's second category as Chase understood that category, and by  a long line of authority holding that a law of this type violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. 

III 

 In a prodigious display of legal and historical textual research, the dissent finely parses cases that offer us support, see post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 565-568; shows appreciation for 19th-century dissident commentary, see post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 569-570; discusses in depth its understanding of late 17th-century and early 18th-century parliamentary history, post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571-575; and does its best to drive a linguistic wedge between Justice Chase's alternative descriptions of categories of ex post facto laws, post, at  ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571.  All to what end?  The dissent undertakes this Herculean effort to prove that it is not unfair, in any constitutionally relevant sense, to prosecute a man for crimes committed 25 to 42 years earlier when nearly a generation has passed since the law granted him an effective amnesty.  Cf. post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 575-579. 

We disagree strongly with the dissent's ultimate conclusion about the fairness of resurrecting a long-dead prosecution.  See infra, at ____- ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 564-565.  Rather, like Judge Learned Hand, we believe that this retroactive application of a later-enacted law is unfair. And, like most other judges who have addressed this issue, see supra, at ____- ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 555-556, we find the words "ex post facto" applicable to describe this kind of unfairness.  Indeed, given the close fit between laws that work this kind of unfairness and the Constitution's concern with ex post facto laws, we might well conclude that California's law falls within the scope of the Constitution's interdiction even were the dissent's historical and precedent-related criticisms better founded than they are. 

We need not examine that possibility here, however, because the dissent's reading of the relevant history and precedent  raises far too many problems to serve as a foundation for the reading of "ex post facto" that it proposes.  In our view, that reading is too narrow; it is unsupported by precedent;  and it would deny liberty where the Constitution gives protection. 

A 

 In the dissent's view, Chase's historical examples show that "Calder's second category concerns only laws" that both (1) "subjec[t] the offender to increased punishment" and (2) do so by "chang[ing] the nature of an offense to make it greater than it was at the time of commission." Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571 (emphasis added).  The dissent does not explain what it means by "changing the nature of an offense," but we must assume (from the fact that this language comes in a dissent) that it means something beyond attaching otherwise unavailable punishment and requires, in addition, some form of recharacterization of the crime.  After all, the dissent seeks to show through its discussion of the relevant historical examples that a new law subjecting to punishment a person not then legally subject to punishment does  not fall within the second category unless the new law somehow changes the kind of crime that was previously at issue. 

The dissent's  discussion of the historical examples suffers from several problems.  First, it raises problems of historical accuracy. In order to show the occurrence of  a change in the kind or nature of the crime, the dissent argues that Parliament's effort to banish the Earl of Clarendon amounted to an effort "to elevate criminal behavior of lower magnitude to the level of treason." Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 572.  The dissent supports this argument with a claim that "the allegations [against Clarendon] could not support a charge of treason." Ibid. Historians, however, appear to have taken a different view.  But cf. post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 574.  In their view, at least one charge against Clarendon did amount to treason. 

Clarendon was charged with "betraying his majesty's secret counsels to his enemies during the war." Edward Earl of Clarendon's Trial, 6 How. St. Tr. 292, 350 (1667) (hereinafter Clarendon's Trial).  In the words of one historian, this charge "undoubtedly contained treasonous matter."  Roberts, The Impeachment of the Earl of Clarendon, 13 Camb. Hist. J. 1, 13 (1957) (hereinafter Roberts, Impeachment); accord, G. Miller, Edward Earl of Clarendon's Trial 21-22 (1983); 10 Dictionary of National Biography 383 (L. Stephen & S. Lee eds. reprint 1922).  See also Roberts, The Law of Impeachment in Stuart England: A Reply to Raoul Berger,84 Yale L. J. 1419, 1426 (1975); R. Berger, Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems 45, n 193 (1974) (acknowledging and not contradicting the historian Henry Hallam's conclusion that "'one of the articles did actually contain an unquestionable treason'").  And it was on the basis of this specific charge--a charge of conduct that amounted to treason--that the House of Commons (which had previously refused to impeach Clarendon on other charges that did not amount to treason) "voted to impeach Clarendon for high treason." Roberts, Impeachment 13; accord, Clarendon's Trial 350-351. 

The House of Lords initially thought that the Commons had failed to provide sufficient evidence because it failed to provide "special articles" laying out "particulars to prove it." Roberts, Impeachment 14.  The Lords and Commons deadlocked over whether a "general charge" was sufficient.  Ibid. See also Clarendon's Trial 351-374.  But Clarendon fled, thereby providing proof of guilt.  10 Dictionary of National Biography, supra,  at 383; see also Clarendon's Trial 389-390; 2 H. Hallam, Constitutional History of England: From the Accession of Henry VII to the Death of George II, p 373 (8th ed. 1855).  See also Berger, supra, at 44-45, and n 189.  The Lords and Commons then agreed to banish Clarendon.  The Act of banishment--the only item in this complicated history explicitly cited by Chase--explained that Clarendon was being banished because he had "been impeached by the Commons . . . of Treason and other misdemeanours" and had "fled whereby Justice cannot be done upon him according to his demerit." 19 & 20 Car. II, c. 2 (1667-1668) (reprint 1963). 

 In sum, Clarendon's case involved Parliament's punishment of an individual who was charged before Parliament with treason and satisfactorily  proven to have committed treason, but whom Parliament punished by imposing "banishment" in circumstances where the party was not, in "the ordinary course of law," liable to any "banishment." See supra, at ____- ____ , 156 L Ed 2d, at 553-554.  Indeed, because Clarendon had fled the country, it had become impossible to hold a proper trial to subject Clarendon to punishment through "ordinary" proceedings.  See 19 & 20 Car. II, c.  2; Clarendon's Trial 385-386.  To repeat, the example of Clarendon's banishment is an example of an individual's being punished through legislation that subjected him to punishment otherwise unavailable, to any degree, through "the ordinary course of law"--just as Chase and his predecessor Wooddeson said. Calder, 3 Dall., at 389, and n †, 1 L Ed 648; 2 Wooddeson, Systematical View 638.  See alsoCarmell,529 U.S., at 523, n. 11, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620. 

 A second problem that the dissent's account raises is one of historical completeness.That account does not explain how the second relevant example--the banishment of the Bishop of Atterbury--can count as an example of a recharacterization of a pre-existing crime.  The dissent concedes that Atterbury was charged with conduct constituting a "conspiracy to depose George I." Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 574.  It ought then to note (but it does not note) that, like the charge of "'betraying his majesty's secret counsels,'" supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 559, this charge was recognized as a charge of treason, see 2 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 266-267 (1883).  As the dissent claims, the evidence upon which Parliament based its decision  to banish may have been "meager," and the punishment may even have been greater than some expected.  Post, at ____- ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 574-575.  But the relevant point is that Parliament did not recharacterize the Bishop's crime.  Rather, through extraordinary proceedings that concluded with a punishment that only the legislature could impose,  Parliament aggravated a predefined crime by imposing a punishment that courts could not have imposed in "the ordinary course." 

Third, the dissent's account raises a problem of vagueness.The dissent describes Justice Chase's alternative description of the second category as "shed[ding] light on the meaning" of the category, post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571, and describes the historical references that accompany Chase's alternative description as "illustrative examples," post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 576.  But the question is would the dissent apply the term ex post facto to laws that fall within the alternative description--or would it not?  If not, how does it reconcile its view with Carmell?  See529 U.S., at 522, n. 9, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620; see alsoid., at 523, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620  (Wooddeson's categories "correlate precisely to Calder's four categories").  If so, how does it explain the fact that the  alternative description nowhere says anything about recharacterizing, or "changing the nature," of a crime? 

In our view, the key to the Atterbury and Clarendon examples lies not in any kind of recharacterization, or the like, but in the fact that Atterbury and Clarendon suffered the "same sentence"--"banishment." 2 Wooddeson, Systematical Analysis 638; see alsoCalder, supra, at 389, n†, 3 U.S. 386, 1 L Ed 648, 3 Dall. 386 (using the word "banishment" to describe both examples).  As we have argued, supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 553-554, Parliament aggravated the crimes at issue by imposing an otherwise unavailable punishment--namely, banishment--which was, according to Wooddeson, a "forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law," 2 Systematical Analysis 638. 

Fourth, the dissent's initial account suffers from a technical problem of redundancy. Were the second category always to involve the recharacterization of an offense in a way that subjects it to greater punishment, see post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571, the second category would be redundant.  Any law falling within it would also necessarily fall within the third category, which already encompasses "'[e]very law that . . . inflicts a greater punishment,'" supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 552 (emphasis added). 

  Fifth, the dissent's historical account raises problems of pertinence. For one thing, to the extent that we are construing the scope of the Calder categories, we are trying not to investigate precisely what happened during the trials of Clarendon and Atterbury, but to determine how, several decades later, an 18th-century legal commentator and an 18th-century American judge who relied on that commentator--and, by extension, the Framers themselves--likely understood the scope of the words "ex post facto." Hence, the dissent's account seems of little relevance once we recognize that: (1) When Justice Chase set forth his alternative language for the second category (the language that the historical  examples are meant to illuminate), he said nothing about recharacterizing crimes,Calder, 3 Dall., at 389, 1 L Ed 648; (2) When Chase speaks of laws "declaring acts to be treason, which were not treason when committed," ibid., he uses this language for his alternative description of first category laws, and not second category laws, supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 552; and (3) Wooddeson says nothing about recharacterizing crimes and instead  uses the Clarendon and Atterbury examples to illustrate laws that "principally affect the punishment, making therein some innovation, or creating some forfeiture or disability, not incurred in the ordinary course of law," 2 Systematical View 638 (some emphasis added).

 Of course, we do not know whether Chase and Wooddeson, in using such language, had statutes of limitations specifically in mind.  We know only that their descriptions of ex post facto laws and the relevant historical examples indicate an ex post facto category broad enough to include retroactive changes in, and applications of, those statutes.  And we  know that those descriptions fit this case--the dissent's historical exegesis notwithstanding. 

 More importantly, even were we to accept the dissent's view that Chase's second category examples involved some kind of recharacterization of criminal behavior (which they did not), why would recharacterization be the ex post facto touchstone?  Why, in a case where (a) application of a previously inapplicable punishment and (b) recharacterization (or "changing the  nature") of criminal behavior do not come hand in hand, should the absence of the latter make a critical  difference?  After all, the presence of a recharacterization without new punishment works no harm.  But the presence of the new punishment without recharacterization works all the harm.  Indeed, it works retroactive harm--a circumstance relevant to the applicability of a constitutional provision aimed at preventing unfair retroactive laws.  Perhaps that is why Justice Chase's alternative description--which, like Wooddeson's, speaks of laws "affect[ing]the punishment," 2 Systematical View 638--does not mention recharacterization or the like. 

B 

 The dissent believes that our discussion of the case law is "less persuasive than it may appear at a first glance." Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 566.  The dissent says that this case law is "deficient," and that we rely on an "inapposite" case and other cases that "flatly contradict" the "principles" on which we rely.  Post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 566-567. 

Having reviewed the relevant cases and commentary, we continue to believe that our characterizations are accurate.  We say that courts, "with apparent unanimity until California's decision in Frazer, have continued to state" that "laws reviving time-barred prosecutions are ex post facto" and, "when necessary, so  to hold." Supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 556-557.  That statement is accurate.  The dissent refers to no case, outside of California, that has held, or even suggested, anything to the contrary. 

 Of course, one might claim that the judges who wrote the cited opinions did not consider the matter as thoroughly as has the dissent or used precisely the same kind of reasoning.  The dissent makes this kind of argument in its discussion of the old New Jersey case,Moore v. State,43 N. J. L. 203 (1881) --a case that we believe supports our view.  The dissent says that the Moore court "expressly stated that a statute reviving an expired limitations period 'is not covered by any of [Justice Chase's] classes.'" Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 567.  And the dissent draws from this language the conclusion that Moore "flatly contradict[s]" our views. Post, at ____- ____ , 156 L Ed 2d, at 567. 

The dissent, however, has taken the language that it quotes out of context.  In context, the court's statement reflects a conclusion that the language of Justice Chase's first description of the categories  (which Moore used the word "classes" to describe) does not fit cases in which a State revives time-barred prosecutions.  The Moore court  immediately adds, however, that Chase's alternative description of second category laws does fit this case.  Indeed, it "easily embraces" a statute that, like the statute here, retroactively extends an expired statute of limitations and "exactly describes [its] operation." 43 N. J. L., at 216-217 (emphasis added).  Had the New Jersey court had the benefit ofCarmell,529 U.S., at 522-524, and n 9, 146 L Ed 2d 577, 120 S Ct 1620, or perhaps even of the dissent itself, post, at ____, ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 571, 575-576, would it not have recognized Chase's alternative description as an authoritative account of elements of Chase's "classes"?  Would it then not have withdrawn its earlier statement,  which the dissent quotes?  Would it not have simply held that the statute did fall within the second category? Our reading of the case leads us to answer these questions affirmatively, but we leave the interested reader to examine the case and draw his or her own conclusions. 

The dissent draws special attention to another case,State v. Sneed,25 Tex. 66, 25 Tex. Supp. 66 (1860), arguing that it is "inapposite" because it "avoided the issue" of whether a law was ex post facto "by holding that the statute was not meant to apply retroactively." Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 566.  Here is the court's analysis, virtually in full: "In this case the bar of the statute of limitations of one year was completed before the code went into operation . . . .  The state having neglected to prosecute within the time prescribed for its own action, lost the right to prosecute the suit.  To give an act of the legislature, passed after such loss, the effect of reviving the right of action in the state, would give it an operation ex post facto, which we cannot suppose the legislature intended." 25 Tex. Supp., at 67.

The reader can make up his own mind. 

Neither can we accept the dissent's view that Judge Learned Hand's like-minded comments in Falter were "unsupported," post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 568.  In fact, Judge Hand's comments had support in pre-existing case law, commentary, and published legislative debates, supra, at ____- ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 555-557, and Hand's opinion specifically cited Moore and two other early cases, Commonwealth v. Duffy,96 Pa. 506 (1880), andPeople v. Buckner,281 Ill. 340, 117 N. E. 1023 (1917). Falter,23 F.2d at 425. 

We add that, whatever  the exact counts of categories of cases that we cite, cf. post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 565-566, it is not surprising that most of these cases involve dicta, while only a handful involve clear holdings.  Where the law has long been accepted as clearly settled, few cases are likely to arise, and cases that do arise most likely involve bordering areas of law, such as new limitations statutes enacted prior to expiration of pre-existing limitations periods.  Consistent with this expectation, one commentator noted in 1993 that the question of whether to give retroactive effect to the extension of unexpired limitations periods had "become timely due to state legislature amendments during the early 1980s that lengthen the limitation period for the crimes of rape and sexual intercourse with a child." Corman, Limitation of Actions § 1.6,  at 36.  The law at issue today represents a kind of extreme variant that, given the legal consensus of unconstitutionality, has not likely been often enacted in our Nation's history.  Cf. 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Law § 219a, p 127 (rev. 4th ed. 1868) (declining to answer whether a law reviving time-barred prosecutions was ex post facto in part because "it is not likely  to come before the courts"). 

Neither should it be surprising if the reasoning in a string of cases stretching back over nearly 150 years is not perfectly consistent with modern conceptions of how legal analysis should proceed.  After all,Beazell v. Ohio,269 U.S. 167, 70 L. Ed. 216, 46 S. Ct. 68 (1925), an opinion relied on by the dissent, post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 570, is itself vulnerable  to criticism that its "method of analysis is foreclosed by this Court's precedents," post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 569.  SeeCollins,497 U.S., at 45-46, 111 L Ed 2d 30, 110 S Ct 2715.  In assessing the case law, we find the essential fact to be the unanimity of judicial views that the kind of statute before us is ex post facto. See supra, at ____- ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 555-556. 

The situation is similar with respect to commentators.  Here, the essential fact is that, over a span of well over a century, commentators have come to the same conclusion, and have done so with virtual unanimity.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 556-557.  We say "virtual," for the dissent identifies one commentator who did not, namely, Joel Bishop--the same commentator relied on 122 years ago by the dissent inMoore, supra, at 240.  The Moore majority rejected Bishop's conclusion.  So did other contemporary  courts and commentators.  Supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 555-557.  We do the same. 

C 

 The dissent says it is a "fallacy" to apply the label "'unfair and dishonest'" to this statute, a law that revives long-dead prosecutions.  Post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 576.  The dissent supports this conclusion with three arguments.  First, it suggests that "retroactive extension of unexpired statutes of limitations" is no less unfair. Post, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 576.  Second, the dissent refers to the small  likelihood that "criminals keep calendars" to mark the expiration of limitations periods, and it mocks the possibility that revival "destroys a reliance interest." Ibid. Third, the dissent emphasizes the harm that child molestation causes, a harm that "will plague the victim for a lifetime," and stresses the need to convict those who abuse children.  Post, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 577-578. 

In making the first argument, the dissent reverses field, abandoning its historical literalism to appeal to practical consequences.  But history, case law, and constitutional purposes all are relevant.  At a minimum, the first two of these adequately explain the difference between expired and unexpired statutes of limitations, and Chase's alternative description of second category laws itself supports such a distinction.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 552-553, 556. 

 In making its second argument, which denies the existence of significant reliance interests, the dissent ignores the potentially lengthy period of time (in this case, 22 years) during which the accused lacked notice that he might be prosecuted and during which he was unaware, for example, of any need to preserve evidence of innocence.  See supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 551.  Memories fade, and witnesses can die or disappear.  See supra, at ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 554.  Such problems can plague child abuse cases, where recollection after so many years may be uncertain, and "recovered" memories faulty, but may nonetheless lead to prosecutions that destroy families.  See, e.g., Holdsworth, Is It Repressed Memory with Delayed Recall or Is It False Memory Syndrome?  The Controversy and Its Potential Legal Implications, 22 Law & Psychol. Rev. 103, 103-104 (1998).  Regardless, a constitutional principle must apply  not only in child abuse cases, but in every criminal case.  And, insofar as we can tell, the dissent's principle would permit the State to revive a prosecution for any kind of crime without any temporal limitation.  Thus, in the criminal  context, the dissent goes beyond our prior statements of what is constitutionally permissible even in the  analogous civil context. Chase Securities Corp. v. Donaldson,325 U.S. 304, 312, n. 8, 89 L. Ed. 1628, 65 S. Ct. 11371137 (1945) (acknowledging that extension of even an expired civil limitations period can unconstitutionally infringe upon a "vested right");William Danzer & Co. v. Gulf & Ship Island R. Co.,268 U.S. 633, 637, 69 L. Ed. 1126, 45 S. Ct. 612 (1925) (holding the same).  But see post, at ____, ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 569, 578.  It is difficult to believe that the Constitution grants greater protection  from unfair retroactivity to property than to human liberty. 

 As to the dissent's third argument, we agree that the State's interest in prosecuting child abuse cases is an important one.  But there is also a predominating constitutional interest in forbidding the State to revive a long-forbidden prosecution.  And to hold that such a law is ex post facto does not prevent the State from extending time limits for the prosecution of future offenses, or for prosecutions not yet time barred. 

 In sum, California's law subjects an individual such as Stogner to prosecution long after the State has, in effect, granted  an amnesty, telling him that he is "at liberty to return to his country . . . and that from henceforth he may cease to preserve the proofs of his innocence," Wharton, Criminal Pleading and Practice § 316, at 210.  See alsoMoore, 43 N. J. L., at 223-224.  It retroactively withdraws a complete defense to prosecution after it has already attached, and it does so in a manner that allows the State to withdraw this defense at will and with respect to individuals already identified.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 156 L Ed 2d, at 551-552.  "Unfair" seems to us a fair characterization. 

IV 

 The statute before us is unfairly retroactive as applied to Stogner.  A long line of judicial authority supports characterization of this law as ex post facto. For the reasons stated, we believe the law falls within Justice Chase's second category of ex post facto laws.  We conclude that a law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations  period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution.  The California court's judgment to the contrary is reversed.  


Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 In this case, we decide whether Georgia's State Senate redistricting plan should have been precleared under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat 439, as renumbered and amended, 42 USC § 1973c [42 USCS § 1973c].  Section 5 requires that before a covered jurisdiction's new voting "standard, practice,  or procedure" goes into effect, it must be precleared by either the Attorney General of the United States or a federal court to ensure that the change "does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color." 42 USC § 1973c [42 USCS § 1973c].  Whether a voting procedure change should be precleared depends on whether the change "would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States,425 U.S. 130, 141, 47 L. Ed. 2d 629, 96 S. Ct. 1357 (1976).  We therefore must decide whether Georgia's State Senate redistricting plan is retrogressive as compared to its previous, benchmark districting plan.

A 

Over the past decade, the propriety of Georgia's state and congressional districts has been the subject of repeated litigation.  In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly began the process of redistricting after the 1990 census. Because Georgia is a covered jurisdiction under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, seeMiller v. Johnson,515 U.S. 900, 905, 132 L. Ed. 2d 762, 115 S. Ct. 2475 (1995), Georgia submitted its revised State Senate plan to the United States Department of Justice for preclearance. The plan as enacted into law increased the number of majority-minority districts from the previous Senate plan.  The Department of Justice nevertheless refused preclearance because of Georgia's failure to maximize the number of majority-minority districts.  SeeJohnson v. Miller, 929 F. Supp. 1529, 1537 and n. 23 (SD Ga. 1996).  After Georgia made changes to the Senate plan in an attempt to satisfy the United States' objections, the State again submitted it to the Department of Justice for preclearance. Again, the Department of Justice refused preclearance because the plan did not contain a sufficient number of majority-minority districts.  Seeid., at 1537, 1539.  Finally, the United States precleared Georgia's third redistricting plan, approving it in the spring of 1992.  Seeid., at 1537. 

Georgia's 1992 Senate plan was not challenged in court.  Seeid., at 1533-1534.  Its congressional districting plan, however, was challenged as unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.SeeShaw v. Reno,509 U.S. 630, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511, 113 S. Ct. 2816 (1993).  In 1995, we held in Miller v Johnson that Georgia's congressional districting plan was unconstitutional because it engaged in "the very racial stereotyping the Fourteenth Amendment forbids" by making race the "predominant, overriding factor explaining" Georgia's congressional districting decisions. 515 U.S., at 928, 920, 132 L Ed 2d 762, 115 S Ct 2475.  And even though it was "safe to say that the congressional plan enacted in the end was required in order to obtain preclearance," this justification did not permit Georgia to engage in racial gerrymandering.  Seeid., at 921, 132 L Ed 2d 762, 115 S Ct 2475.  Georgia's State Senate districts served as "building blocks" to create the congressional districting plan found unconstitutional in Miller v Johnson.Johnson v. Miller, 929 F. Supp. , at 1533, n. 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); see alsoid., at 1536. 

Georgia recognized that after Miller v Johnson, its legislative districts were unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.  See929 F. Supp. , at 1533, 1540.Accordingly, Georgia attempted to cure the perceived constitutional problems with  the 1992 State Senate districting plan by passing another plan in 1995.  The Department of Justice refused to preclear the 1995 plan, maintaining that it retrogressed from the 1992 plan and that Miller v Johnson concerned only Georgia's congressional districts, not Georgia's State Senate districts.  See929 F. Supp. , at 1540-1541. 

Private litigants subsequently brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1995 Senate plan.  Seeid., at 1533.  The three-judge panel of the District Court reviewing the 1995 Senate plan  found that "it is clear that a black maximization policy had become an integral part of the section 5 preclearance process . . . when the Georgia redistricting plans were under review.  The net effect of the DOJ's preclearance objection[s] . . . was to require the State of Georgia to increase the number of majority black districts in its redistricting plans, which were already ameliorative plans, beyond any reasonable concept of non-retrogression." Id., at 1539-1540.  The court noted that in Miller v Johnson, we specifically  disapproved of the Department of Justice's policy that the maximization of black districts was a part of the § 5 retrogression analysis.  See929 F. Supp. , at 1539.  Indeed, in Miller, we found that the Department of Justice's objections to Georgia's redistricting plans were "driven by its policy of maximizing majority-black districts." 515 US, at 924, 132 L Ed 2d 762, 115 S Ct 2475.  And "in utilizing § 5 to require States to create majority-minority districts wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we have upheld." Id., at 925, 132 L Ed 2d 762, 115 S Ct 2475. 

The District Court stated that the maximization of majority-minority districts in Georgia "artificially push[ed] the percentage of black voters within some majority black districts as high as possible."  929 Fed. Supp., at 1536.  The plan that eventually received the Department of Justice's preclearance in 1992 "represented the General Assembly's surrender to the black maximization policy of the DOJ." Id., at 1540.  The court then found that the 1995 plan was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.  Seeid., at 1543.

 Under court direction, Georgia and the Department of Justice reached a mediated agreement on the constitutionality of the 1995 Senate plan.  Georgia passed a new plan in 1997, and the Department of Justice quickly precleared it.  The redrawn map resembled to a large degree the 1992 plan that eventually received preclearance from the Department of Justice, with some changes to accommodate the decision of this Court in Miller v Johnson, and of the District Court in Johnson v Miller.

 All parties here concede that the 1997 plan is the benchmark plan for this litigation because it was in effect at the time of the 2001 redistricting effort.  The 1997 plan drew 56 districts, 11 of them with a total black population of over 50%, and 10 of them with a black voting age population of over 50%.  See Record, Doc. No. 148, Pl. Exh. 1C (hereinafter Pl. Exh.).  The 2000 census revealed that these numbers had increased so that 13 districts had a black population of at least 50%, with the black voting age population exceeding 50% in 12 of those districts.  See195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 39 (DC 2002). 

After the 2000 census, the Georgia General Assembly began the process of redistricting  the Senate once again.  No party contests that a substantial majority of black voters in Georgia vote Democratic, or that all elected black representatives in the General Assembly are Democrats.  The goal of the Democratic leadership--black and white--was to maintain the number of majority-minority districts and also increase the number of Democratic Senate seats.  See  id., at 41-42.  For example, the Director of Georgia's Legislative Redistricting Office, Linda Meggers, testified that the Senate Black Caucus "'wanted to maintain'" the existing majority-minority districts and at the same time "'not waste'" votes. Id., at 41. 

The Vice Chairman of the Senate Reapportionment Committee, Senator Robert Brown, also testified about the goals of the redistricting effort.  Senator Brown, who is black, chaired the subcommittee that developed the Senate plan at issue here.  Seeid., at 42.  Senator Brown believed when he designed the Senate plan that as the black voting age population in a district increased beyond what was necessary, it would "push the whole thing more towards [the] Republican[s]." Pl. Exh. 20, at 24.  And "correspondingly," Senator  Brown stated, "the more you diminish the power of African-Americans overall." Ibid. Senator Charles Walker was the majority leader of the Senate.  Senator Walker  testified that it was important to attempt to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate because "we [African-Americans] have a better chance to participate in the political process under the Democratic majority than we would have under a Republican majority." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19.  At least 7 of the 11 black members of the Senate could chair committees.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 41. 

The plan as designed by Senator Brown's committee kept true to the dual goals of maintaining at least as many majority-minority districts while also attempting to increase Democratic strength in the Senate.  Part of the Democrats' strategy was not only to maintain the number of majority-minority districts, but to increase the number of so-called "influence" districts, where black voters would be able to exert a significant--if not decisive--force in the election process.  As the majority leader testified, "in the past, you know, what we would end up doing was packing.  You put all blacks in one district and all whites in one district,  so what you end up with is [a] black Democratic district and [a] white Republican district.  That's not a good strategy.  That does not bring the people together, it divides the population.  But if you put people together on voting precincts it brings people together." Pl. Exh. 24, at 19. 

The plan as designed by the Senate "unpacked" the most heavily concentrated majority-minority districts in the benchmark plan, and created a number of new influence districts.  The new plan drew 13 districts with a majority-black voting age population, 13 additional districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%, and 4 other districts with a black voting age population of between 25% and 30%.  See Pl. Exh. 2C.  According to the 2000 census, as compared to the benchmark plan, the new plan reduced by five the number  of districts with a black voting age population in excess of 60%.  Compare Pl. Exh. 1D with Pl. Exh. 2C.  Yet it increased the number of majority-black voting age population districts by one, and it increased the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 25% and 50% by four.  As compared to the benchmark plan enacted in 1997, the difference is even  larger.  Under the old census figures, Georgia had 10 Senate districts with a majority-black voting age population, and 8 Senate districts with a black voting age population  of between 30% and 50%.  See Pl. Exh. 1C.  The new plan thus increased the number of districts with a majority black voting age population by three, and increased the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50% by another five.  Compare Pl. Exh. 1C with Pl. Exh. 2C. 

The Senate adopted its new districting plan on August 10, 2001, by a vote of 29 to 26.  Ten of the eleven black Senators voted for the plan. 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 55.  The Georgia House of Representatives passed the Senate plan by a vote of 101 to 71.  Thirty-three of the thirty-four black Representatives voted for the plan.  Ibid. No Republican in either the House or the Senate voted for the plan, making the votes of the black legislators necessary for passage.  Seeid., at 41.  The Governor signed the Senate plan into law on August 24, 2001, and Georgia subsequently sought to obtain preclearance. 

B 

 Pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a covered jurisdiction like Georgia has the option  of either seeking administrative preclearance through the Attorney General of the United States or seeking judicial preclearance by instituting an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that the voting change comports with § 5.  42 USC § 1973c [42 USCS § 1973c];Georgia v. United States,411 U.S. 526, 36 L. Ed. 2d 472, 93 S. Ct. 1702 (1973).  Georgia chose the latter method, filing suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the State Senate plan does not violate § 5. 

Georgia, which bears the burden of proof in this action, seePleasant Grove v. United States,479 U.S. 462, 93 L. Ed. 2d 866, 107 S. Ct. 794 (1987), attempted to prove that its Senate plan was not retrogressive  either in intent or in effect.  It submitted detailed evidence documenting in each district the total population, the total black population, the black voting age population, the percentage of black registered voters, and the overall percentage of Democratic votes (i.e., the overall likelihood that voters in a particular district will vote Democratic), among other things.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs. 2C, 2D.  The State also submitted evidence about how each of these statistics compared to the benchmark districts.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 36; see also Pl. Exhs. 1C, 1D, 1E (revised). 

Georgia also submitted testimony from numerous people who had participated in enacting the Senate plan into law, and from United States Congressman John Lewis, who represents the Atlanta area.  These witnesses testified that the new Senate plan was designed to increase black voting strength throughout the State as well as to help ensure a continued Democratic majority in the Senate.  The State also submitted expert testimony that African-American and non-African-American voters have equal chances of electing their preferred candidate when the black voting age population of a district is at 44.3%.  Finally, in response to objections raised by the United States, Georgia submitted more detailed statistical evidence with respect to three proposed Senate districts that the United States found objectionable--Districts 2, 12, and 26--and two districts that the intervenors challenged--Districts 15 and 22. 

 The United States, through  the Attorney General, argued in District Court that Georgia's 2001 Senate redistricting plan should not  be precleared. It argued that the plan's changes to the boundaries of Districts 2, 12, and 26 unlawfully reduced the ability of black voters to elect candidates of their choice.  See Brief for Federal Appellees 8;195 F. Supp. 2d, at 72.  The United States noted that in District 2, the black  voting age population dropped from 60.58% to 50.31%; in District 12, the black voting age population dropped from 55.43% to 50.66%; and in District 26, the black voting age population dropped from 62.45% to 50.80%. 1Georgia and the United States have submitted slightly different figures regarding the black voting age population of each district.  The differing figures depend upon whether the total number of blacks includes those people who self-identify as both black and a member of another minority group, such as Hispanic.  Georgia counts this group of people, while the United States does not do so.  Like the District Court, we consider all the record information, "including total black population, black registration numbers and both [black voting age population] numbers." 195 F. Supp. 2d 25, 79 (DC 2002).  We focus in particular on Georgia's black voting age population numbers in this case because all parties rely on them to some extent and because Georgia used its own black voting age population numbers when it enacted the Senate plan.  Moreover, the United States does not count all persons who identify themselves as black.  It counts those who say they are black and those who say that they are both black and white, but it does not count those who say they are both black and a member of another minority group. Using the United States' numbers may have more relevance if the case involves a comparison of different minority groups.  Cf.Johnson v. De Grandy,512 U.S. 997, 129 L. Ed. 2d 775, 114 S. Ct. 2647 (1994);Bush v. Vera,517 U.S. 952, 135 L. Ed. 2d 248, 116 S. Ct. 1941 (1996).  Here, however, the case involves an examination of only one minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise. In such circumstances, we believe it is proper to look at all individuals who identify themselves as black. Moreover, in all  three of these districts, the percentage of black registered voters dropped to just under 50%.  The United States also submitted expert evidence that voting is racially polarized in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26.  Seeid., at 69-71.  The United States acknowledged that some limited percentage of whites would vote for a black candidate, but maintained that the percentage was not sufficient for black voters to elect their candidate of choice.  Seeid., at 70-71.  The United States also offered testimony from various witnesses, including lay witnesses living in the three districts, who asserted that the new contours of Districts 2, 12, and  26 would reduce the opportunity for blacks to elect a candidate of their choice in those districts; Senator Regina Thomas of District 2, the only black Senator who voted against the plan; Senator Eric Johnson, the Republican leader of the Senate; and some black legislators who voted  for the plan but questioned how the plan would affect black voters. See Vols. 25-27 Record, Doc. No. 177, United States Exhs. 707-736 (Depositions).  As the District Court stated, "the United States' evidence was extremely limited in scope--focusing only on three contested districts in the State Senate plan.  That evidence was not designed to permit the court to assess the overall impact of [the Senate plan]." 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 37.  

 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, the District Court also permitted four African-American citizens of Georgia to intervene.  The intervenors identified two other districts--Districts 15 and 22--where they alleged retrogression had occurred.  The intervenors "present[ed] little evidence other than proposed alternative plans and an expert report critiquing the State's expert  report." 195 F. Supp. 2d, at 37. 

A three-judge panel of the District Court held that Georgia's State Senate apportionment violated § 5, and was therefore not entitled to preclearance. Seeid., at 97.  Judge Sullivan, joined by Judge Edwards, concluded that Georgia had "not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the State Senate redistricting plan would not have a retrogressive effect on African American voters'" effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Ibid. The court found that Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26 were retrogressive because in each district, a lesser opportunity existed for the black candidate of choice to win election under the new plan than under the benchmark plan.  Seeid., at 93-94.  The court found that the reductions in black voting age population in Districts 2, 12, and 26 would "diminish African American voting strength in these districts," and that Georgia had "failed to present any . . . evidence" that the retrogression in those districts "will be offset by gains in other districts." Id., at 88. 

 Judge Edwards, joined by Judge Sullivan, concurred.  Judge Edwards emphasized that §§ 5 and 2 are "procedurally and substantively distinct provisions." Id., at 97.  He therefore rejected Georgia's argument that a plan preserving an equal opportunity for minorities to elect candidates of their choice satisfies § 5.  Judge Edwards also rejected the testimony of the black Georgia politicians who supported the Senate plan.  In his view, the testimony did not address whether racial polarization was occurring in Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26.  Seeid., at 101-102. 

Judge Oberdorfer dissented.  He would have given "greater credence to the political expertise and motivation of Georgia's African-American political leaders and  reasonable inferences drawn from their testimony and the voting data and statistics." Id., at 102.  He noted that this Court  has not answered "whether a redistricting plan that preserves or increases the number of districts statewide in which minorities have a fair or reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of choice is entitled to preclearance, or whether every district must remain at or improve on the benchmark probability of victory, even if doing so maintains a minority super-majority far in excess of the level needed for effective exercise of [the] electoral franchise." Id., at 117. 

After the District Court refused to preclear the plan, Georgia enacted another plan, largely similar to the one at issue here, except that it added black voters to Districts 2, 12, and 26.  The District Court precleared this plan.  See204 F. Supp. 2d 4 (2002).  No party has contested the propriety of the District Court's preclearance of the Senate plan as amended. Georgia asserts that it will use the plan as originally enacted if it receives preclearance. 

We noted probable jurisdiction to consider whether the District Court should have precleared the plan as originally enacted by Georgia in 2001 537 U.S. 1151, 154 L. Ed. 2d 861, 123 S. Ct. 964, and now vacate the judgment below. 

 II 

 Before addressing the merits  of Georgia's preclearance claim, we address the State's argument that the District Court was incorrect in allowing the private litigants to intervene in this lawsuit.  Georgia maintains that private parties should not be allowed to intervene in § 5 actions because States should not be subjected to the political stratagems of intervenors. While the United States disagrees with Georgia on the propriety of intervention here, the United States argues that this question is moot because the participation of the intervenors did not affect the District Court's ruling on the merits and the intervenors did not appeal the court's ruling. 

 We do not think Georgia's argument is moot.  The intervenors did not have to appeal because they were prevailing parties below.  Moreover, the District Court addressed the evidence that the intervenors submitted, which is now in front of this Court.  The issue whether intervenors are proper parties still has relevance in this Court because they argue here that the District Court correctly found that the Senate plan was retrogressive. 

 The District Court properly found that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 governs intervention in this case.  Section 5permits a State to bring "an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment." 42 USC § 1973c [42 USCS § 1973c].  Section 5 does not limit in any way the application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to this type of lawsuit, and the statute by its terms does not bar private parties from intervening.  InNAACP v. New York,413 U.S. 345, 365, 37 L. Ed. 2d 648, 93 S. Ct. 2591 (1973), we held that in an action under § 5, "intervention in a federal court suit is governed by Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 24." 

To support its argument, Georgia relies onMorris v. Gressette,432 U.S. 491, 53 L. Ed. 2d 506, 97 S. Ct. 2411 (1977).  In Morris, we held that in an administrative preclearance action, the decision to object belongs only to the Attorney General and is not judicially  reviewable.  Seeid., at 504-505, 53 L Ed 2d 506, 97 S Ct 2411.  But Morris concerned the administrative preclearance process, not the judicial preclearance process.  Morris itself recognized the difference between administrative preclearance and judicial preclearance. Seeid., at 503-507, 53 L Ed 2d 506, 97 S Ct 2411. 

Here, the District Court granted the motion to intervene because it found that the intervenors' "analysis of the . . . Senate redistricting plan identifies interests that are not adequately represented  by the existing parties." App. to Juris.  Statement 218a.  Private parties may intervene in § 5 actions assuming they meet the requirements of Rule 24, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to intervene in this case.  SeeNAACP v. New York, supra, at 367, 37 L Ed 2d 648, 93 S Ct 2591. 

III 

A 

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act "has a limited substantive goal: "'to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.'" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 926, 132 L Ed 2d 762, 115 S Ct 2475 (quotingBeer v. United States, 425 U.S., [at 141, 47 L Ed 2d 629, 96 S Ct 1357])." Bush v. Vera,517 U.S. 952, 982-983, 135 L. Ed. 2d 248, 116 S. Ct. 1941 (1996).  Thus, a plan that merely preserves "current minority  voting strength" is entitled to § 5 preclearance. City of Lockhart v. United States,460 U.S. 125, 134, n. 10, 74 L. Ed. 2d 863, 103 S. Ct. 998 (1983);Bush v. Vera, supra, at 983, 135 L Ed 2d 248, 116 S Ct 1941.  Indeed, a voting change with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose or effect does not violate§ 5.  SeeReno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 528 U.S. 320, 341, 145 L. Ed. 2d 845, 120 S. Ct. 866 (2000).  And "no matter how unconstitutional it may be," a plan that is not retrogressive should be precleared under § 5. Id., at 336, 145 L Ed 2d 845, 120 S Ct 866.  "Preclearance under § 5 affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding." Id., at 335, 145 L Ed 2d 845, 120 S Ct 866. 

Georgia argues that a plan should be precleared under § 5 if the plan would satisfy § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 USC § 1973 [42 USCS § 1973].  We have, however, "consistently understood" § 2 to "combat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties upon the States." Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd.,520 U.S. 471, 477, 137 L. Ed. 2d 730, 117 S. Ct. 1491 (1997)(Bossier Parish I). For example, while § 5 is limited to particular covered jurisdictions, § 2 applies to all States.  And the § 2 inquiry differs in significant respects from a § 5 inquiry.  In contrast to § 5's retrogression standard, the "essence" of a § 2 vote dilution claim is that "a certain electoral law, practice, or structure . . . cause[s] an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.  " Thornburg v. Gingles,478 U.S. 30, 47, 92 L. Ed. 2d 25, 106 S. Ct. 2752 (1986); see alsoid., at 48-50, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (enunciating a three-part test to establish vote dilution);id., at 85-100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752  (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); 42 U.S.C. § 1973(b) [42 USCS § 1973(b)]..  Unlike an inquiry under § 2, a retrogression inquiry under § 5, "by definition, requires a comparison of a jurisdiction's new voting plan with its existing plan." Bossier Parish I, supra, at 478, 137 L Ed 2d 730, 117 S Ct 1491.  While some parts of the § 2 analysis may overlap with the § 5 inquiry, the two sections "differ in structure, purpose, and application." Holder v. Hall,512 U.S. 874, 883, 129 L. Ed. 2d 687, 114 S. Ct. 2581 (1994) (plurality opinion). 

In Bossier Parish I, we specifically held that a violation of § 2 is not an independent reason to deny preclearance under § 5.  See 520 US, at 477, 137 L Ed 2d 730, 117 S Ct 1491.  The reason for this holding was straightforward: "[§ 2 violations as a basis for denying § 5 preclearance would inevitably make compliance with § 5 contingent upon compliance with § 2.  Doing so would, for all intents and purposes, replace the standards for § 5 with those for § 2." Ibid. 

Georgia here makes the flip side of the argument that failed in Bossier Parish I--compliance with § 2 suffices for preclearance under § 5.  Yet the argument fails here for the same reasons the argument failed inBossier Parish IBossier Parish I. We refuse to equate a § 2 vote dilution inquiry with the § 5 retrogression standard.  Georgia's argument, like the argument  in Bossier Parish I, would "shift the focus of § 5 from nonretrogression to vote dilution, and [would] change the § 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existing plan to a hypothetical, undiluted plan." Id., at 480, 137 L Ed 2d 730, 117 S Ct 1491.  Instead of showing that the Senate  plan is nondilutive under § 2, Georgia must prove that its plan is nonretrogressive under § 5. 

B 

Georgia argues that even if compliance with § 2 does not automatically result in preclearance under § 5, its State Senate plan should be precleared because it does not lead to "a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States, supra, at 141, 47 L Ed 2d 629, 96 S Ct 1357.  See, e.g., Brief for Appellant 32, 36. 

 While we have never determined the meaning  of "effective exercise of the electoral franchise," this case requires us to do so in some detail.  First, the United States and the District Court correctly acknowledge that in examining whether the new plan is retrogressive, the inquiry must encompass the entire statewide plan as a whole.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 73; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29.  Thus, while the diminution of a minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise in one or two districts may be sufficient to show a violation of § 5, it is only sufficient if the covered jurisdiction cannot show that the gains in the plan as a whole offset the loss in a particular district. 

 Second, any assessment of the retrogression of a minority group's effective exercise of the electoral franchise depends on an examination of all the relevant circumstances, such as the ability of minority voters to elect their candidate of choice, the extent of the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process, and the feasibility of creating a nonretrogressive plan.  See, e.g.,Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1011-1012, 1020-1021, 129 L. Ed. 2d 775, 114 S. Ct. 2647 (1994);Richmond v. United States,422 U.S. 358, 371-372, 45 L. Ed. 2d 245, 95 S. Ct. 2296 (1975); Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 97-100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  "No single statistic provides courts with a shortcut to determine whether" a voting change retrogresses from the benchmark. Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1020-1021, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647. 

 In assessing the totality of the circumstances, a court should not focus solely on the comparative ability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice.  While this factor is an important one in the § 5 retrogression inquiry, it cannot be dispositive or exclusive.  The standard in § 5 is simple--whether the new plan "would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States, 425 U.S., at 141, 47 L Ed 2d 629, 96 S Ct 1357. 

 The ability of minority voters to elect a candidate of their choice is important but often complex in practice to determine.  In order to maximize the electoral success of a minority group, a State may choose to create a certain number of "safe" districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice.  See Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S., at 48-49, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752; id., at 87-89, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  Alternatively, a State may choose to create a greater number of districts in which it is likely--although perhaps not quite as likely as under the benchmark plan--that  minority voters will be able to elect candidates of their choice.  Seeid., at 88-89, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Pildes, Is Voting-Rights Law Now at War With Itself?  Social Science and Voting Rights in the 2000s,80 N. C. L. Rev. 1517 (2002). 

Section 5 does not dictate that a State must pick one of these methods of redistricting over another.  Either option "will  present the minority group with its own array of electoral risks and benefits," and presents "hard choices about what would truly 'maximize' minority electoral success." Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  On one hand, a smaller number of safe  majority-minority districts may virtually guarantee the election of a minority group's preferred candidate in those districts.  Yet even if this concentration of minority voters in a few districts does not constitute the unlawful packing of  minority voters, seeVoinovich v. Quilter,507 U.S. 146, 153-154, 122 L. Ed. 2d 500, 113 S. Ct. 1149 (1993), such a plan risks isolating minority voters from the rest of the state, and risks narrowing political influence to only a fraction of political districts.  Cf.Shaw v. Reno,509 U.S., at 648-650, 125 L Ed 2d 511, 113 S Ct 2816.  And while such districts may result in more "descriptive representation" because the representatives of choice are more likely to mirror the race of the majority of voters in that district, the representation may be limited to fewer areas.  See H. Pitkin, The Concept of Representation 60-91 (1967). 

On the other hand, spreading out minority voters over a greater number of districts creates more districts in which minority voters may have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.  Such a strategy has the potential to increase "substantive representation" in more districts, by creating coalitions of voters who together will help to achieve the electoral aspirations of the minority group. See id., at 114.  It also, however, creates the risk that the minority group's preferred candidate may lose.  Yet as we stated inJohnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1020, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647: "There are communities in which minority citizens are able to form coalitions with voters from other racial and ethnic groups, having no need to be a majority within a single district in order to elect candidates of their choice.  Those candidates may not represent perfection to every minority voter, but minority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground, the virtue of which is not to be slighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics."

Section 5 gives States the flexibility to choose one theory of effective representation over the other. 

 In addition to the comparative ability of a minority group to elect a candidate of its choice, the other highly relevant factor in a retrogression inquiry is the extent to which a new plan changes the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process.  "'The power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections.'" Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 99, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quotingDavis v. Bandemer,478 U.S. 109, 132, 92 L. Ed. 2d 85, 106  S. Ct. 2797 (1986)); see alsoWhite v. Regester,412 U.S. 755, 766-767, 37 L. Ed. 2d 314, 93 S. Ct. 2332 (1973);Whitcomb v. Chavis,403 U.S. 124, 149-160, 29 L. Ed. 2d 363, 91 S. Ct. 1858 (1971);Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S., at 1011-1012, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647. 

Thus, a court must examine whether a new plan adds or subtracts "influence districts"--where minority voters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive, role in the electoral process.  Cf.Shaw v. Hunt,517 U.S. 899, 947, n. 21, 135 L. Ed. 2d 207, 116 S. Ct. 1894 (1996) (Stevens, J., dissenting);Hays v. Louisiana, 936 F. Supp. 360, 364, n. 17 (WD La. 1996);Johnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1011-1012, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647;Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S., at 98-100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  In assessing the comparative weight of these influence districts, it is important to consider "the likelihood that candidates elected without decisive minority support would be willing to take the minority's interests into account." Id., at 100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  In fact, various studies have suggested that the most effective way to maximize minority voting strength may be to create more influence or coalitional districts.  See, e.  g., Lublin, Racial Redistricting and African-American Representation: A Critique of "Do Majority-Minority Districts Maximize Substantive Black Representation in Congress?" 93 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 183, 185 (1999) (noting that racial redistricting in the early 1990's, which created more majority-minority districts, made Congress "less likely to adopt initiatives supported by blacks"); Cameron, Epstein, &  O'Halloran, Do Majority-Minority Districts Maximize Substantive Black Representation in Congress?  90 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 794, 808 (1996) (concluding that the "districting schemes that maximize the number of minority representatives do not necessarily maximize substantive minority representation"); C. Swain, Black Faces, Black Interests 193-234 (1995); Pildes, 80 N. C. L. Rev., at 1517; Grofman, Handley, & Lublin, Drawing Effective Minority Districts: A Conceptual Framework and Some Empirical Evidence,79 N. C. L. Rev. 1383(2001). 

Section 5leaves room for States to use these types of influence and coalitional districts.  Indeed, the State's choice ultimately may rest on a political choice of whether substantive or descriptive representation is preferable.  See  Pitkin, supra, at 142; Swain, supra, at 5.  The State may choose, consistent with § 5, that it is better to risk having fewer minority representatives in order to achieve greater overall representation of a minority group by increasing the number of representatives sympathetic to the interests of minority voters. SeeThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S., at 87-89, 99, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); cf.Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S., at 1020, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647. 

 In addition to influence districts, one other method of assessing the minority group's opportunity to participate in the political process is to examine the comparative position of legislative leadership, influence, and power for representatives of the benchmark majority-minority districts.  A legislator, no less than a  voter, is "not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground." Ibid. Indeed, in a representative democracy, the very purpose of voting is to delegate to chosen representatives the power to make and pass laws.  The ability to exert more control over that process is at the core of exercising political power.  A lawmaker with more legislative  influence has more potential to set the agenda, to participate in closed-door meetings, to negotiate from a stronger position, and to  shake hands on a deal.  Maintaining or increasing legislative positions of power for minority voters' representatives of choice, while not dispositive by itself, can show the lack of retrogressive effect under § 5. 

 And it is also significant, though not dispositive, whether the representatives elected from the very districts created and protected by the Voting Rights Act support the new districting plan.  The District Court held that the support of legislators from benchmark majority-minority districts may show retrogressive purpose, but it is not relevant in assessing retrogressive effect.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 89; see also post, at 156 L Ed 2d 428 at 466-467, 123 S. Ct. 2498 (opinion of Souter, J.).  But we think this evidence is also relevant for retrogressive effect.  As the dissent recognizes, the retrogression inquiry asks how "voters will probably act in the circumstances in which they live." Post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 470.  The representatives of districts created to ensure continued minority participation in the political process have some knowledge about how "voters will probably act" and whether the proposed change will decrease minority voters' effective exercise of the electoral franchise. 

 The dissent maintains that standards for determining nonretrogression under § 5 that we announce today create a situation where "it is very hard to see anything left of" § 5. Post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 461.  But the dissent ignores that the ability of a minority  group to elect a candidate of choice remains an integral feature in any § 5 analysis.  Cf.Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 98, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  And the dissent agrees that the addition or subtraction of coalitional districts is relevant to the § 5 inquiry.  See post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 459, 467.  Yet assessing whether a plan with coalitional districts is retrogressive is just as fact-intensive as whether a plan with both influence and coalitional districts is retrogressive. As Justice Souter recognized for the Court in the § 2 context, a court or the Department of Justice should assess the totality of circumstances in determining retrogression under § 5.  SeeJohnson v. De Grandy, supra, at  1020-1021, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647.  And it is of course true that evidence of racial polarization is one of  many factors relevant in assessing whether a minority group is able to elect a candidate of choice or to exert a significant influence in a particular district.  SeeThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S., at 37, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752;id., at 100-104, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see alsoWhite v. Regester, 412 U.S., at 755, 37 L Ed 2d 314, 93 S Ct 2332 (1973);Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d 1297 (CA5 1973) (en banc). 

 The dissent nevertheless  asserts that it "cannot be right" that the § 5 inquiry goes beyond assessing whether a minority group can elect a candidate of its choice. Post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 460.  But except for the general statement of retrogression in Beer, the dissent cites no law to support its contention that retrogression should focus solely on the ability of a minority group to elect a candidate of choice.  As Justice Souter himself, writing for the Court inJohnson v. De Grandy, supra, at 1011-1012, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647, has recognized, the "extent of the opportunities minority voters enjoy to participate in the political processes" is an important factor to consider in assessing a § 2 vote-dilution inquiry.  See alsoThornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 98-100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  In determining how the new districting plan differs from the benchmark plan, the same standard should apply to § 5. 

C 

 The District Court failed to consider all the relevant factors when it examined whether Georgia's Senate plan resulted in a retrogression of black voters' effective exercise of the electoral franchise. First, while the District Court acknowledged the importance of assessing the statewide plan as a whole, the court focused too narrowly on proposed Senate Districts 2, 12, and 26.  It did not examine the increases in the  black voting age population that occurred in many of the other districts.  Second, the District Court did not explore in any meaningful depth any other factor beyond the comparative ability of black voters in the majority-  minority districts to elect a candidate of their choice.  In doing so, it paid inadequate attention to the support of legislators representing the benchmark majority-minority districts and the maintenance of the legislative influence of those representatives. 

The District Court correctly recognized that the increase in districts with a substantial minority of black voters is an important factor  in the retrogression inquiry.  See195 F. Supp. 2d, at 75-78.  Nevertheless, it did not adequately apply this consideration to the facts of this case.  The District Court ignored the evidence of numerous other districts showing an increase in black voting age population, as well as the other evidence that Georgia decided that a way to increase black voting strength was to adopt a plan that "unpacked" the high concentration of minority voters in the majority-minority districts.  Its statement that Georgia did not "present evidence regarding potential gains in minority voting strength in Senate Districts other than Districts 2, 12 and 26" is therefore clearly erroneous. Id., at 94.  Like the dissent, we accept the District Court's findings that the reductions in black voting age population in proposed Districts 2, 12, and 26 to just over 50% make it marginally less likely that minority voters can elect a candidate of their choice in those districts, although we note that Georgia introduced evidence showing that approximately one-third of white voters would support a black candidate in those districts, seeid., at 66, and that the United States'  own expert admitted that the results of statewide elections in Georgia show that "there would be a 'very good chance' that . . . African American candidates would win election in the reconstituted districts." Id., at 71; see  alsoid., at 84-85.  Nevertheless, regardless of any racially polarized voting or diminished opportunity for black voters to elect a candidate of their choice in proposed Districts 2, 12, and 26, the District Court's inquiry was too narrow. 

 In the face of Georgia's evidence that the Senate plan as a whole is not retrogressive, the United States introduced nothing apart from the evidence that it would be more difficult for minority voters to elect their candidate of choice in Districts 2, 12, and 26.  As the District Court stated, the United States did not introduce any evidence to rebut Georgia's evidence that the increase in black voting age population in the other districts offsets any decrease in black voting age population in the three contested districts: "The United States' evidence was extremely limited in scope--focusing only on three contested districts in the State Senate plan." Id., at 37.  Indeed, the  District Court noted that the United States' evidence "was not designed to permit the court to assess the overall impact" of the Senate plan.  Ibid.

Given the evidence submitted in this case, we find that Georgia likely met its burden of showing nonretrogression. The increase in black voting age population in the other districts likely offsets any marginal decrease in the black voting age population in the three districts that the District Court found retrogressive. Using the overlay of the 2000 census numbers, Georgia's strategy of "unpacking" minority voters in some districts to create more influence and coalitional districts is apparent.  Under the 2000 census numbers, the number of majority black voting age population districts in the new plan increases by one, the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50% increases by two, and the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 25% and 30% increases by another 2.  See Pl. Exhs. 1D, 2C; see also supra, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 462-463. 

 Using the census numbers in effect at the time the benchmark plan was enacted to assess the benchmark plan, the difference is even more striking.  Under those figures, the new plan increases from 10 to 13 the number of districts with a majority-black voting age population and increases from 8 to 13 the number of districts with a black voting age population of between 30% and 50%.  See Pl. Exhs. 1C, 2C.  Thus,  the new plan creates 8 new districts--out of 56--where black voters as a group can play a substantial or decisive role in the electoral process.  Indeed, under the census figures in use at the time Georgia enacted its benchmark plan, the black voting age population in Districts 2, 12, and 26 does not decrease to the extent indicated by the District Court.  District 2 drops from 59.27% black voting age population to 50.31%.  District 26 drops from 53.45% black voting age population to 50.80%.  And District 12 actually increases, from 46.50% black voting age population to 50.66%.  See Pl. Exhs. 1C, 2C. 2 The dissent summarily rejects any inquiry into the benchmark plan using the census numbers in effect at the time the redistricting plan was passed.  See post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 467-468.  Yet we think it is relevant to examine how the new plan differs from the benchmark plan as originally enacted by the legislature.  The § 5 inquiry, after all, revolves around the change from the previous plan.  The 1990 census numbers are far from "irrelevant." Post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 467.  Rather, examining the benchmark plan with the census numbers in effect at the time the State enacted its plan comports with the one-person, one-vote principle of Reynolds v. Sims,377 U.S. 533, 12 L. Ed. 2d 506, 84 S. Ct. 1362 (1964), and its progeny.  When the decennial census numbers are released, States must redistrict to account for any changes or shifts in population.  But before the new census, States operate under the legal fiction that even 10 years later, the plans are constitutionally apportioned.  After the new enumeration, no districting plan is likely to be legally enforceable if challenged, given the shifts and changes in a population over 10 years.  And if the State has not redistricted in response to the new census figures, a federal court will ensure that the districts comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate before the next election. See, e.g.,Branch v. Smith, 538 US 254, 155 L. Ed. 2d 407, 123 S. Ct. 1429 (2003);Lawyer v. Department of Justice,521 U.S. 567, 138 L. Ed. 2d 669, 117 S. Ct. 2186 (1997);Growe v. Emison,507 U.S. 25, 122 L. Ed. 2d 388, 113 S. Ct. 1075 (1993). And regardless of any  potential retrogression  in some districts, § 5 permits Georgia to offset the decline in those districts with an increase in the black voting age population in other districts.  The testimony from those who designed the Senate plan confirms what the statistics suggest--that Georgia's goal was to "unpack" the minority  voters from a few districts to increase blacks' effective exercise  of the electoral franchise in more districts.  See supra, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 445-446.  

 Other evidence supports the implausibility of finding retrogression here.  An examination of black voters' opportunities to participate in the political process shows, if anything, an increase in the effective exercise of the electoral franchise. It certainly does not indicate retrogression. The 34 districts in the proposed plan with a black voting age population of above 20% consist almost entirely of districts that have an overall percentage of Democratic votes of above 50%.  See Pl. Exh. 2D.  The one exception is proposed District 4, with a black voting age population of 30.51% and an overall Democratic percentage of 48.86%.  See ibid. These statistics make it more likely as a matter of fact that black voters will constitute an effective voting bloc, even if they cannot always elect the candidate of their choice.  SeeThornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S., at 100, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  These statistics also buttress the testimony of the designers of the plan such as Senator Brown, who stated that the goal of the plan was to maintain or increase black voting strength and relatedly to increase the prospects of Democratic victory.  See supra, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 445. 

 The testimony of Congressman John Lewis is not so easily dismissed.  Congressman Lewis is not a member of the State Senate and thus has less at stake personally in the outcome of this litigation.  Congressman Lewis testified that "giving real power to black voters comes from the kind of redistricting efforts the State of Georgia has made," and that the Senate plan "will give real meaning to voting for African Americans" because "you have a greater chance of putting in office people that are going to be responsive." Pl. Exh. 21, at 21-23.  Section 5 gives States the flexibility to implement the type of plan that Georgia has submitted for preclearance--a plan that increases the number of districts with a majority-black voting age population, even if it means that in some of those districts, minority voters will face a  somewhat reduced opportunity to elect a candidate of their  choice.  Cf.Thornburg v. Gingles, supra, at 89, 92 L Ed 2d 25, 106 S Ct 2752 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). 

 The dissent's analysis presumes that we are deciding that Georgia's Senate plan is not retrogressive. See post, at 156 L Ed 2d, at 465-469.  To the contrary, we hold only that the District Court did not engage in the  correct retrogression analysis because it focused too heavily on the ability of the minority group to elect a candidate of its choice in the majority-minority districts.  While the District Court engaged in a thorough analysis of the issue, we must remand the case for the District Court to examine the facts using the standard that we announce today.  We leave it for the  District Court to determine whether Georgia has indeed met its burden of proof.  The dissent justifies its conclusion here on the ground that the District Court did not clearly err in its factual determination.  But the dissent does not appear to dispute that if the District Court's legal standard was incorrect, the decision below should be vacated. 

 The purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral franchise and to foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race.  Cf. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S., at 1020, 129 L Ed 2d 775, 114 S Ct 2647;Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S., at 657, 125 L Ed 2d 511, 113 S Ct 2816.  As Congressman Lewis stated: "I think that's what the [civil rights] struggle was all about, to create what I like to call a truly interracial democracy in the South.  In the movement, we would call it creating the beloved community, an all-inclusive community, where we would be able to forget about race and color and see people as people, as human beings, just as citizens." Pl. Exh. 21, at 14.  While courts and the Department of Justice should be vigilant in ensuring that States neither reduce the effective exercise of the electoral franchise nor discriminate against minority voters, the Voting Rights Act, as properly interpreted, should encourage the transition to a society where race no longer matters: a society where integration  and color-blindness are not just qualities to be proud of, but are simple facts of life.  SeeShaw v. Reno, supra, at 657, 125 L Ed 2d 511, 113 S Ct 2816. 

IV 

 The District Court is in a better position to reweigh all the facts in the record in the first instance in light of our explication of retrogression. The judgment of the District Court for the District of Columbia, accordingly, is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 

Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places.  In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home.  And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence.  Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.  Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought,  belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.  The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions. 

I 

 The question before the Court is the validity of a Texas statute making it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage in certain intimate sexual conduct. 

In Houston, Texas, officers of the Harris County Police Department were dispatched to a private residence in response to a reported weapons disturbance.  They entered an apartment where one of the petitioners, John Geddes Lawrence,  resided.  The right of the police to enter does not seem to have been questioned.  The officers observed Lawrence and another man, Tyron Garner, engaging in a sexual act.   The two petitioners were arrested, held in custody over night, and charged and convicted before a Justice of the Peace. 

The complaints described their crime as "deviate sexual intercourse, namely anal sex, with a member of the same sex (man)." App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a, 139a.  The applicable state law is Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 21.06(a) (2003).  It provides: "A person commits an offense if he engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex." The statute defines "deviate sexual intercourse" as follows: "(A) any contact between any part of the genitals of one person and the mouth or anus of another person; or "(B) the penetration of the genitals or the anus of another person with an object." § 21.01(1).

The petitioners exercised their right to a trial de novo in Harris County Criminal Court.  They challenged the statute as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and of a like provision of the Texas Constitution.  Tex. Const., Art. 1, § 3a.  Those contentions were rejected.  The petitioners, having entered a plea of nolo contendere, were each fined $ 200 and assessed court costs of $ 141.25.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a-110a. 

The Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District considered the petitioners' federal constitutional arguments under both the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. After hearing the case en banc the court, in a divided opinion, rejected the constitutional arguments and affirmed the convictions. 41 S. W. 3d 349 (Tex. App. 2001).  The majority opinion indicates that the Court of Appeals considered our decision inBowers v. Hardwick,478 U.S. 186, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140, 106 S. Ct. 2841 (1986), to be controlling on the federal due process aspect of the case.  Bowers then being authoritative, this was proper. 

 We granted certiorari,537 U.S. 1044, 154 L. Ed. 2d 514, 123 S. Ct. 661 (2002), to consider three questions: "1. Whether Petitioners' criminal convictions under the Texas "Homosexual Conduct" law--which criminalizes sexual intimacy by same-sex couples, but not identical behavior by different-sex couples--violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection of laws? "2. Whether Petitioners' criminal convictions for adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home violate their vital interests in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment? "3. WhetherBowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140, 106 S. Ct. 2841 (1986), should be overruled?" Pet. for Cert. i.

The petitioners were adults at the time of the alleged offense.  Their conduct was in private and consensual. 

II 

We conclude the case should be resolved by determining whether the petitioners were free as adults to engage in the private conduct in the exercise of their liberty under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  For this inquiry we deem it necessary to reconsider the Court's holding in Bowers.

There are broad statements of the substantive reach of liberty under the Due Process Clause in earlier cases, includingPierce v. Society of Sisters,268 U.S. 510, 69 L. Ed. 1070, 45 S. Ct. 571 (1925), andMeyer v. Nebraska,262 U.S. 390, 67 L. Ed. 1042, 43 S. Ct. 625 (1923); but the most pertinent beginning point is our decision inGriswold v. Connecticut,381 U.S. 479, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510, 85 S. Ct. 1678 (1965). 

In Griswold the Court invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of drugs or devices of contraception and counseling or aiding and abetting the use of contraceptives.  The Court described the protected interest as a right to privacy and  placed emphasis on the marriage relation and the protected space of the marital bedroom. Id., at 485, 14 L Ed 2d 510, 85 S Ct 1678. 

After Griswold it was established that the right to make certain decisions regarding sexual conduct extends beyond the marital relationship.  InEisenstadt v. Baird,405 U.S. 438, 31 L. Ed. 2d 349, 92 S. Ct. 1029 (1972), the Court invalidated a law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons.  The case was decided under the Equal Protection Clause,id., at 454, 31 L Ed 2d 349, 92 S Ct 1029; but with respect to unmarried persons, the Court went on to state the fundamental proposition that the law impaired the exercise of their personal rights, ibid. It quoted from the statement of the Court of Appeals finding the law to be in conflict with fundamental human rights, and it followed with this statement of its own: "It is true that in Griswold the right of privacy in question inhered in the marital relationship.  . . .  If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child." Id., at 453, 31 L Ed 2d 349, 92 S Ct 1029.

The opinions in Griswold and Eisenstadt were part of the background for the decision inRoe v. Wade,410 U.S. 113, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, 93 S. Ct. 705 (1973).  As is well known, the case involved a challenge to the Texas law prohibiting abortions, but the laws of other States were affected as well.  Although the Court held the woman's rights were not absolute, her right to elect an abortion did have real and substantial protection as an exercise of her liberty under the Due Process Clause.  The Court cited cases that protect spatial freedom and cases that go well beyond it.  Roe recognized the right of a woman to make certain fundamental decisions affecting her destiny and confirmed once more that the protection of liberty under the Due Process Clause has a substantive dimension of fundamental significance in defining the rights of the person. 

 InCarey v. Population Services Int'l,431 U.S. 678, 52 L. Ed. 2d 675, 97 S. Ct. 2010 (1977), the Court confronted a New York law forbidding sale or distribution of contraceptive devices to persons under 16 years of age.  Although there was no single opinion for the Court, the law was invalidated. Both Eisenstadt and Carey, as well as the holding and rationale in Roe, confirmed that the  reasoning of Griswold could not be confined to the protection of rights of married adults. This was the state of the law with respect to some of the most relevant cases when the Court considered Bowers v Hardwick.

 The facts in Bowers had some similarities to the instant case.  A police officer, whose right to enter seems not to have been in question, observed Hardwick, in his own bedroom, engaging in intimate sexual conduct with another adult male.  The conduct was in violation of a Georgia statute making it a criminal offense to engage in sodomy. One difference between the two cases is that the Georgia statute prohibited the conduct whether or not the participants were of the same sex, while the Texas statute, as we have seen, applies only to participants of the same sex. Hardwick was not prosecuted, but he brought an action in federal court to declare the state statute invalid.  He alleged he was a practicing homosexual and that the criminal prohibition violated rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution.  The Court, in an opinion by Justice White, sustained the Georgia law.  Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell joined the opinion of the Court and filed separate, concurring opinions.  Four Justices dissented.  478 US, at 199, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens, JJ.);id., at 214, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.). 

 The Court began its substantive discussion in Bowers as follows: "The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal and have done so  for a very long time." Id., at 190, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841.  That statement, we now conclude, discloses the Court's own failure to appreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.  To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward, just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse. The laws involved in Bowers and here are, to be sure, statutes that purport to do no more than prohibit a particular sexual act.  Their penalties and purposes, though, have more far-reaching consequences, touching upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.  The statutes do seek to control a personal relationship that, whether or not entitled to formal recognition in the law, is within the liberty of persons to choose without being punished as criminals. 

This, as a general rule, should counsel against attempts by the State, or a court, to define the meaning of the relationship or to set its boundaries absent injury to a person or abuse of an institution the law protects.  It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons.  When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person, the conduct can be but one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.  The liberty protected by the Constitution allows  homosexual persons the right to make this choice. 

 Having misapprehended the claim of liberty there presented to it, and thus stating the claim to be whether there is a fundamental right to engage in consensual sodomy, the Bowers Court said: "Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots." Id., at 192, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841.  In academic writings, and in many of the scholarly amicus briefs filed to assist the Court in this case, there are fundamental criticisms of the historical premises relied upon by the majority and concurring opinions  in Bowers. Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 16-17; Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 15-21; Brief for Professors of History et al. as Amici Curiae 3-10.  We need not enter this debate in the attempt to reach a definitive historical judgment, but the following considerations counsel against adopting the definitive conclusions upon which Bowers placed such reliance. 

At the outset it should be noted that there is no longstanding history in this country of laws directed at homosexual conduct as a distinct matter.  Beginning in colonial times there were prohibitions of sodomy derived from the English criminal laws passed in the first instance by the Reformation Parliament of 1533.  The English prohibition was understood to include relations between men and women as well as relations between men and men.  See, e.g., King v Wiseman, 92 Eng. Rep. 774, 775 (K. B. 1718) (interpreting "mankind" in Act of 1533 as including women and girls).  Nineteenth-century commentators similarly read American sodomy, buggery, and crime-against-nature statutes as criminalizing certain relations between men and women and between men and men.  See, e.g., 2 J. Bishop, Criminal Law § 1028 (1858); 2 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 47-50 (5th Am. ed. 1847); R. Desty, A Compendium of American Criminal Law 143 (1882); J. May, The Law of Crimes § 203 (2d ed. 1893).  The absence of legal prohibitions focusing on homosexual conduct may be explained in part by noting that according to some scholars the concept of the homosexual as a distinct category of person did not emerge until the late 19th century.  See, e.g., J. Katz, The Invention of Heterosexuality 10 (1995); J. D'Emilio & E. Freedman, Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America 121 (2d ed. 1997) ("The modern terms homosexuality and heterosexuality do not apply to an era that had not yet articulated these distinctions").  Thus early American sodomy laws were not directed at homosexuals as such but instead sought to prohibit nonprocreative sexual activity more generally.  This does not suggest approval of  homosexual conduct.  It does tend to show that this particular form of conduct was not thought of as a separate category from like conduct between heterosexual persons. 

Laws prohibiting sodomy do not seem to have been enforced against consenting adults acting in private.  A substantial number of sodomy prosecutions and convictions for which there are surviving records were for predatory acts against those who could not or did not consent, as in the case of a minor or the victim of an assault.  As to these, one purpose for the prohibitions was to ensure there would be no lack of coverage if a predator committed a sexual assault that did not constitute rape  as defined by the criminal law. Thus the model sodomy indictments presented in a 19th-century treatise, see 2 Chitty, supra, at 49, addressed the predatory acts of an adult man against a minor girl or minor boy.  Instead of targeting relations between consenting adults in private, 19th-century sodomy prosecutions typically involved relations between men and minor girls or minor boys, relations between adults involving force, relations between adults implicating disparity in status, or relations between men and animals. 

To the extent that there were any prosecutions for the acts in question, 19th-century evidence rules imposed a burden that would make a conviction more difficult to obtain even taking into account the problems always inherent in prosecuting consensual acts committed in private.  Under then-prevailing standards, a man could not be convicted of sodomy based upon testimony of a consenting partner, because the partner was considered an accomplice.  A partner's testimony, however, was admissible if he or she had not consented to the act or was a minor, and therefore incapable of consent.  See, e.g., F. Wharton, Criminal Law 443 (2d ed. 1852); 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Law 512 (8th ed. 1880).  The rule may explain in part the infrequency of these prosecutions.  In all events that infrequency makes it difficult to say that society approved of a rigorous and systematic  punishment of the consensual acts committed in private and by adults. The longstanding criminal prohibition of homosexual sodomy upon which the Bowers decision placed such reliance is as consistent with a general condemnation of nonprocreative sex as it is with an established tradition of prosecuting acts because of their homosexual character. 

The policy of punishing consenting adults for private acts was not much discussed in the early legal literature.  We can infer that one reason for this was the very private nature of the conduct.  Despite the absence of prosecutions, there may have been periods in which there was public criticism of homosexuals as such and an insistence that the criminal laws be enforced to discourage their practices.  But far from possessing "ancient roots," Bowers, 478 U.S., at 192, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841, American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century.  The reported decisions concerning the prosecution of consensual, homosexual sodomy between adults for the years 1880-1995 are not always clear in the details, but a significant number involved conduct in a public place.  See Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 14-15, and n 18. 

It was not until the 1970's that any State singled out same-sex relations for criminal prosecution, and only nine States have done so.  See 1977 Ark. Gen. Acts no. 828; 1983 Kan. Sess. Laws p 652; 1974 Ky.  Acts p 847; 1977 Mo. Laws p 687; 1973 Mont. Laws p 1339; 1977 Nev. Stats. p 1632; 1989 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 591; 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 399; see alsoPost v. State, 1986 OK CR 30, 715 P.2d 1105 (Okla. Crim. App. 1986) (sodomy law invalidated as applied to different-sex couples).  Post-Bowers even some of these States did not adhere to the policy of suppressing homosexual conduct.  Over the course of the last decades, States with same-sex prohibitions have moved toward abolishing them.  See, e.g.,Jegley v.  Picado, 349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332 (2002);Gryczan v. State, 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997);Campbell v. Sundquist, 926 S.W.2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996);Commonwealth v. Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487 (Ky. 1992); see also 1993 Nev. Stats. p 518 (repealing Nev. Rev. Stat. § 201.193). 

In summary, the historical grounds relied upon in Bowers are more complex than the majority opinion and the concurring opinion by Chief Justice Burger indicate.  Their historical premises are not without doubt and, at the very least, are overstated. 

 It must be acknowledged, of course, that the Court in Bowers was making the broader point that for centuries there have been powerful voices to condemn homosexual conduct as immoral. The condemnation has been shaped by religious beliefs, conceptions of right and acceptable behavior, and respect for the traditional family.  For many persons these are not trivial concerns but profound and deep convictions accepted as ethical and moral principles to which they aspire and which thus determine the course of their lives.  These considerations do not answer the question before us, however.  The issue is whether the majority may use the power of the State to enforce these views on the whole society through operation of the criminal law.  "Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code." Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,505 U.S. 833, 850, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992). 

 Chief Justice Burger joined the opinion for the Court in Bowers and further explained his views as follows: "Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization. Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeao-Christian moral and ethical standards." 478 US, at 196, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841.  As with Justice White's assumptions about history, scholarship casts some doubt on the sweeping nature of the statement by Chief Justice Burger as it pertains to private homosexual conduct between consenting adults. See, e.g., Eskridge, Hardwick and Historiography,1999 U. Ill. L. Rev. 631, 656.  In all events we think that our laws and traditions in the past half century are of  most relevance here.  These references show an emerging awareness that liberty gives substantial protection to adult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.  "History and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry." County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 857, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043, 118 S. Ct. 1708 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). 

 This emerging recognition should have been apparent when Bowers was decided.  In 1955 the American Law Institute promulgated the Model Penal Code and made clear that it did not recommend or provide for "criminal penalties for consensual sexual relations conducted in private." ALI, Model Penal Code § 213.2, Comment 2, p 372 (1980).  It justified its decision on three grounds: (1) The prohibitions undermined respect for the law by penalizing conduct many people engaged in; (2) the statutes regulated private conduct not harmful to others; and (3) the laws were arbitrarily  enforced and thus invited the danger of blackmail.  ALI, Model Penal Code, Commentary 277-280 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  In 1961 Illinois changed its laws to conform to the Model Penal Code.  Other States soon followed.  Brief for Cato Institute as Amicus Curiae 15-16. 

In Bowers the Court referred to the fact that before 1961 all 50 States had outlawed sodomy, and that at the time of the Court's decision 24 States and the District of Columbia had sodomy laws. 478 U.S., at 192-193, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841.  Justice Powell pointed out that these prohibitions often were being ignored, however.  Georgia, for instance, had not sought to enforce its law for decades. Id., at 197-198, n. 2, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841 ("The history of nonenforcement suggests the moribund character today of laws criminalizing this type of private, consensual conduct"). 

The sweeping references by Chief Justice Burger to the history of Western civilization and to Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards did not take account of other authorities pointing in an opposite direction.  A committee advising the British Parliament recommended in 1957 repeal of laws  punishing homosexual conduct.  The Wolfenden Report: Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (1963).  Parliament enacted the substance of those recommendations 10 years later.  Sexual Offences Act 1967, § 1. 

Of even more importance, almost five years before Bowers was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to Bowers and to today's case.  An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct.  The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right.  He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution.  The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Dudgeon v United Kingdom, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) P 52.  Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in Bowers that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization. 

In our own constitutional system the deficiencies in Bowers became even more apparent in the years following its announcement.  The 25 States with laws prohibiting the relevant conduct referenced in the Bowers decision are reduced now to 13, of which 4 enforce their laws only against homosexual conduct.  In those States where sodomy is still proscribed, whether for same-sex or heterosexual conduct, there is a pattern of nonenforcement with respect to consenting adults acting in private.  The State of Texas admitted in 1994 that as of that date it had not prosecuted anyone under those circumstances. State v. Morales, 869 S.W.2d 941, 943, 37 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 390. 

Two principal cases decided after Bowers cast its holding into even more doubt.  InPlanned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,505 U.S. 833, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674, 112 S. Ct. 2791 (1992), the Court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The Casey decision again confirmed  that our laws and tradition afford constitutional  protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Id., at 851, 120 L Ed 2d 674, 112 S Ct 2791.  In explaining the respect the Constitution demands for the autonomy of the person in making these choices, we stated as follows: "These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.  Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State." Ibid.

 Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.  The decision in Bowers would deny them this right. 

The second post-Bowers case of principal relevance isRomer v. Evans,517 U.S. 620, 134 L. Ed. 2d 855, 116 S. Ct. 1620 (1996).  There the Court struck down class-based legislation directed at homosexuals as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  Romer invalidated an amendment to Colorado's constitution which named as a solitary class persons who were homosexuals, lesbians, or bisexual either by "orientation, conduct, practices or relationships,"id., at 624, 134 L Ed 2d 855, 116 S Ct 1620 (internal quotation marks omitted), and deprived them of protection under state antidiscrimination laws.  We concluded that the provision was "born of animosity toward the class of persons affected" and further that it had no rational relation to a legitimate governmental purpose. Id., at 634, 134 L Ed 2d 855, 116 S Ct 1620.. 

As an alternative argument in this case, counsel for the petitioners and some amici contend that Romer provides the basis for declaring the Texas statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause.  That is a tenable argument, but we conclude  the instant case requires us to address whether Bowers itself has continuing validity.  Were we to hold the statute invalid under the Equal Protection Clause some might question whether a prohibition would be valid if drawn differently, say, to prohibit the conduct both between same-sex and different-sex participants. 

Equality of treatment and the due process right to demand respect for conduct protected by the substantive guarantee of liberty are linked in important respects, and a decision on the latter point advances both interests.  If protected conduct is made criminal and the law which does so remains unexamined for its substantive validity, its stigma might remain even if it were not enforceable as drawn for equal protection reasons.  When homosexual conduct is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres.  The central holding of Bowers has been brought in question by this case, and it should be addressed.  Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons. 

 The stigma this criminal statute  imposes, moreover, is not trivial.  The offense, to be sure, is but a class C misdemeanor, a minor offense in the Texas legal system.  Still, it remains a criminal offense with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged.  The petitioners will bear on their record the history of their criminal convictions.  Just this Term we rejected various challenges to state laws requiring the registration of sex offenders. Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. __, 538 U.S. 84, 155 L. Ed. 2d 164, 123 S. Ct. 1140 (2003);Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe, 538 U.S. 1, 155 L. Ed. 2d 98, 123 S. Ct. 1160 (2003).  We are advised that if Texas convicted an adult for private, consensual homosexual conduct under the statute here in question the convicted person would come within the registration laws of at least four States were he or she to be subject to their jurisdiction.  Pet. for Cert. 13, and n 12 (citing Idaho Code §§ 18-8301 to 18-8326 (Cum. Supp. 2002); La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., §§ 15:540-15:549 (West 2003); Miss. Code Ann. §§ 45-33-21 to 45-33-57 (Lexis 2003); S. C. Code Ann. §§ 23-3-400 to 23-3-490 (West 2002)).  This underscores the consequential nature of the punishment and the state-sponsored condemnation attendant to the criminal prohibition.  Furthermore, the Texas criminal conviction carries with it the other collateral consequences always following a conviction, such as notations on job application forms, to mention but one example. 

 The foundations of Bowers have sustained serious erosion from our recent decisions in Casey and Romer. When our precedent has been thus weakened, criticism from other sources is of greater significance.  In the United States criticism of Bowers has been substantial and continuing, disapproving of its reasoning in all respects, not just as to its historical assumptions.  See, e.g., C. Fried, Order and Law: Arguing the Reagan Revolution--A Firsthand Account 81-84 (1991); R. Posner, Sex and Reason 341-350 (1992).  The courts of five different States have declined to follow it in interpreting provisions in their own state constitutions parallel to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, seeJegley v. Picado, 349 Ark. 600, 80 S. W. 3d 332 (2002); Powell v. State , 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E.2d 18, 24 (1998);Gryczan v. State , 283 Mont. 433, 942 P.2d 112 (1997);Campbell v. Sundquist, 926 S.W.2d 250 (Tenn. App. 1996);Commonwealth v. Wasson, 842 S.W.2d 487 (Ky. 1992). 

 To the extent Bowers relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in Bowers have been rejected elsewhere.  The European Court of Human Rights has followed not Bowers but its own decision in Dudgeon v United Kingdom. See P. G. & J. H. v United Kingdom, App. No. 00044787/98, P 56 (Eur. Ct. H. R., Sept. 25, 2001); Modinos v Cyprus, 259 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1993); Norris v Ireland, 142 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1988).  Other nations, too, have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct.  See Brief for Mary  Robinson et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12.  The right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries.  There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent. 

 The doctrine of stare decisis is essential to the respect accorded to the judgments of the Court and to the stability of the law.  It is not, however, an inexorable command. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 828, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720, 111 S. Ct. 2597 (1991)("Stare decisis is not an inexorable command; rather, it 'is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision'") (quotingHelvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119, 84 L. Ed. 604, 60 S. Ct. 444, 1940-1 C.B. 223 (1940))).  In Casey we noted that when a Court is asked to overrule a precedent recognizing a constitutional liberty interest, individual or societal reliance on the existence of that liberty cautions with particular strength against reversing course. 505 U.S., at 855-856, 120 L Ed 2d 674, 112 S Ct 2791; see alsoid., at 844, 120 L Ed 2d 674, 112 S Ct 2791("Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt").  The holding in Bowers, however, has not induced detrimental reliance comparable to some instances where recognized individual rights are involved.  Indeed, there has been no individual or societal reliance on Bowers of the sort that could counsel against overturning its holding once there are compelling reasons to do so.  Bowers itself causes uncertainty, for the precedents before and after its issuance contradict its central holding. 

 The rationale of Bowers does not withstand careful analysis.  In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens came to these conclusions: "Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear.  First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional  attack.  Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried as well as married persons." 478 US, at 216, 92 L Ed 2d 140, 106 S Ct 2841 (footnotes and citations omitted).

 Justice Stevens' analysis, in our view, should have been controlling in Bowers and should control here. 

Bowers was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today.  It ought not to remain binding precedent. Bowers v. Hardwick should be and now is overruled. 

 The present case does not involve minors.  It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused.  It does not involve public conduct or prostitution.  It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.  The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle.  The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives.  The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.  Their right to liberty under the Due Process  Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.  "It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter." Casey, supra, at 847, 120 L Ed 2d 674, 112 S Ct 2791.  The Texas statute furthers no legitimate state interest which can justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of the individual. 

Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific.  They did not presume  to have this insight.  They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress.  As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Texas Fourteenth District is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 104 Stat 327, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. [42 USCS §§ 12101 et seq.], makes it unlawful for an employer, with respect to hiring, to "discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual." § 12112(a).  We are asked to decide in this case whether the ADA confers preferential rehire rights on disabled employees lawfully terminated for violating workplace conduct rules.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an employer's unwritten policy not to rehire employees who left the company for violating personal conduct rules contravenes the ADA, at least as applied to employees who were lawfully forced to resign for illegal drug use but have since been rehabilitated. Because the Ninth Circuit improperly applied a disparate-impact analysis in a disparate-treatment case in order to reach this holding, we vacate its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We do not, however, reach the question on which we granted certiorari. 537 U.S. 1187, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1018, 123 S. Ct. 1255 (2003). 

I 

Respondent, Joel Hernandez, worked for Hughes Missile Systems for 25 years. 1Hughes has since been acquired by petitioner, Raytheon Company.  For the sake of clarity, we refer to Hughes and Raytheon collectively as petitioner or the company. On July 11, 1991, respondent's appearance  and behavior at work suggested that he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  Pursuant to company policy, respondent took a drug test, which came back positive for cocaine.  Respondent subsequently admitted that he had been up late drinking beer and using cocaine the night before the test.  Because respondent's behavior violated petitioner's workplace conduct rules, respondent was forced to resign. Respondent's "Employee Separation Summary" indicated as the reason for separation: "discharge for personal conduct (quit in lieu of discharge)." App. 12a. 

More  than two years later, on January 24, 1994, respondent applied to be rehired by petitioner.  Respondent stated on his application that he had previously been employed by petitioner.  He also attached two reference letters to the application, one from his pastor, stating that respondent was a "faithful and active member" of the church, and the other from an Alcoholics Anonymous counselor, stating that respondent attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly and is in recovery.  Id., at 13a-15a. 

 Joanne Bockmiller, an employee in the company's Labor Relations Department, reviewed respondent's application.  Bockmiller testified in her deposition that since respondent's application disclosed his prior employment with the company, she pulled his personnel file and reviewed his employee separation summary.  She then rejected respondent's application.  Bockmiller insisted that the company had a policy against rehiring employees who were terminated for workplace misconduct. Id., at 62a.  Thus, when she reviewed the employment separation summary and found that respondent had been discharged for violating workplace conduct rules, she rejected respondent's application.  She testified, in particular,  that she did not know that respondent was a former drug addict when she made the employment decision and did not see anything that would constitute a "record of" addiction. Id., at 63a-64a. 

 Respondent subsequently filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  Respondent's charge of discrimination indicated that petitioner did not give him a reason for his nonselection, but that respondent believed he had been discriminated against in violation of the ADA. 

 Petitioner responded to the charge by submitting a letter to the EEOC, in which George M. Medina, Sr., Manager of Diversity Development, wrote: "The ADA specifically exempts from protection individuals currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when the covered entity acts on the basis of that use.  Contrary to Complainant's unfounded allegation, his non-selection for rehire is not based on any legitimate disability. Rather, Complainant's application was rejected based on his demonstrated drug use while previously employed and the complete lack of evidence indicating successful drug rehabilitation. "The Company maintains it's [sic] right to deny re-employment to employees terminated for violation of Company rules and regulations.  . . .  Complainant has provided no evidence to alter the Company's position that Complainant's conduct while employed by [petitioner] makes him ineligible for rehire." Id., at 19a-20a.

This response, together with evidence that the letters submitted with respondent's employment application may have alerted Bockmiller to the reason for respondent's prior termination, led the EEOC to conclude that petitioner may have "rejected [respondent's] application based on his record of past alcohol and drug use." Id., at 94a EEOC Determination Letter, Nov. 20, 1997.  The EEOC thus found that there was "reasonable cause to believe that [respondent] was denied hire to the position of Product Test Specialist because of his disability." Id., at 95a.  The EEOC issued a right-to-sue  letter, and respondent subsequently filed this action alleging a violation of the ADA. 

Respondent proceeded through discovery on the theory that the company rejected his application because of his record of drug addiction and/or because he was regarded as being a drug addict. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12102(2)(B)-(C) [42 USCS  §§ 12102(2)(B)-(C)]. 2The ADA defines the term "disability" as: "(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; "(B) a record of such an impairment; or "(C) being regarded as having such an impairment." 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) [42 USCS § 12102(2)]. In response to petitioner's motion for summary judgment, respondent for the first time argued in the alternative that if the company really did apply a neutral no-rehire policy in his case, petitioner still violated the ADA because such a policy has a disparate impact. The District Court granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment with respect to respondent's disparate-treatment claim.  However, the District Court refused to consider respondent's disparate-impact claim because respondent had failed to plead or raise the theory in a timely manner. 

 The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that respondent had failed timely to raise his disparate-impact claim. Hernandez v. Hughes Missile Systems Co., 298 F.3d 1030, 1037, n. 20 (CA9 2002).In addressing respondent's disparate-treatment claim, the Court of Appeals proceeded under the familiar burden-shifting approach first adopted by this Court inMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973). 3 The Court in McDonnell Douglas set forth a burden-shifting scheme for discriminatory-treatment cases.  Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.  The burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action.  411 U.S., at 802, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817.  If the employer meets this burden, the presumption of intentional discrimination disappears, but the plaintiff can still prove disparate treatment by, for instance, offering evidence demonstrating that the employer's explanation is pretextual.  SeeReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105, 120 S. Ct. 2097 (2000).  The Courts of Appeals have consistently utilized this burden-shifting approach when reviewing motions for summary judgment in disparate-treatment cases.  See, e.g.,Pugh v. Attica, 259 F.3d 619, 626 (CA7 2001) (applying burden-shifting approach to an ADA disparate-treatment claim). First, the Ninth Circuit found that with respect  to respondent's prima facie case of discrimination, there were genuine issues of material fact regarding whether respondent was qualified for the position for which he sought to be rehired, and whether the reason for petitioner's refusal to rehire him was his past record of drug addiction. 4The Court of Appeals noted that "it is possible that a drug user may not be 'disabled' under the ADA if his drug use does not rise to the level of an addiction which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities." 298 F.3d at 1033-1034, n. 9.  The parties do not dispute that respondent was "disabled" at the time he quit in lieu of discharge and thus a record of the disability exists.  We therefore need not decide in this case whether respondent's employment record constitutes a "record of addiction," which triggers the protections of the ADA. The parties are also not disputing in this Court whether respondent was qualified for the position for which he applied.298 F.3d at 1034-1035.  The Court of Appeals thus held that with respect to respondent's prima facie case of discrimination, respondent had proffered sufficient evidence to preclude a grant of summary judgment. Id., at 1035.  Because petitioner does not challenge this aspect of the Ninth Circuit's decision, we do not address it here. 

The Court of Appeals then moved to the next step of McDonnell Douglas, where the burden shifts to the  defendant to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment action.  411 U.S., at 802, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817.  Here, petitioner contends that Bockmiller applied the neutral policy against rehiring employees previously terminated for violating workplace conduct rules and that this neutral company policy constituted a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason  for its decision not to rehire respondent.  The Court of Appeals, although admitting that petitioner's no-rehire rule was lawful on its face, held the policy to be unlawful "as applied to former drug addicts whose only work-related offense was testing positive because of their addiction." 298 F.3d at 1036.  The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner's application of a neutral no-rehire policy was not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for rejecting respondent's application: "Maintaining a blanket policy against rehire of all former employees who violated company policy not only screens out persons with a record of addiction who have been successfully rehabilitated, but may well result, as [petitioner] contends it did here, in the staff member who makes the employment decision remaining unaware of the "disability" and thus of the fact that she is committing an unlawful act.  . . .  Additionally, we hold that a policy that serves to bar the reemployment of a drug addict despite his successful rehabilitation violates the ADA." Id., at 1036-1037.

 In other words, while ostensibly evaluating whether petitioner had proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for failing to rehire respondent sufficient to rebut respondent's prima facie showing of disparate treatment, the Court of Appeals held that a neutral no-rehire policy could never suffice in a case where the employee was terminated for illegal drug use, because such a policy has a disparate impact on recovering drug addicts.  In so holding, the Court of Appeals erred by conflating the analytical framework for disparate-impact and disparate-treatment claims.  Had the Court of Appeals correctly applied the disparate-treatment framework, it would have been obliged to conclude that a neutral no-rehire policy is, by definition, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory  reason under the ADA. 5This would not, of course, resolve the dispute over whether petitioner did in fact apply such a policy in this case.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals expressed some confusion on this point, as the court first held that respondent "raise[d] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was denied re-employment because of his past record of drug addiction,"id., 298 F.3d at 1034, but then later stated that there was "no question that [petitioner] applied this [no-rehire] policy in rejecting [respondent's] application," id., 298 F.3d at 1036, n. 17. And thus the only remaining question would be whether respondent could produce sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that "petitioner's stated reason for respondent's rejection was in fact pretext." McDonnell Douglas, supra, at 804, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, 93 S. Ct. 1817. 

 II 

This Court has consistently recognized a distinction between claims of discrimination based on disparate treatment and claims of discrimination based on disparate impact. The Court has said that "'[d]isparate treatment' . . . is the most easily understood type of discrimination.  The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others  because of their race, color, religion, sex, or [other protected characteristic]." Teamsters v. United States,431 U.S. 324, 335, n. 15, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396, 97 S. Ct. 1843 (1977).  See alsoHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,507 U.S. 604, 609, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993) (discussing disparate-treatment claims in the context of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967).  Liability in a disparate-treatment case "depends on whether the protected trait . . . actually motivated the employer's decision." Id., at 610, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701.  By contrast, disparate-impact claims "involve employment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified by business necessity." Teamsters, supra, at 335-336, n. 15, 52 L. Ed. 2d 396, 97 S. Ct. 1843.  Under a disparate-impact theory of discrimination,  "a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed [illegally discriminatory] without evidence of  the employer's subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a 'disparate-treatment' case." Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,490 U.S. 642, 645-646, 104 L. Ed. 2d 733, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds, Civil Rights Act of 1991, § 105, 105 Stat 1074-1075, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k) (1994 ed.) [42 USCS § 2000e-2(k)]. 

 Both disparate-treatment and disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b) [42 USCS § 12112(b)] (defining "discriminate" to include "utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration . . . that have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability" and "using qualification standards, employment tests or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability").  Because "the factual issues, and therefore the character of the evidence presented, differ when the plaintiff claims that a facially neutral employment policy has a discriminatory impact on protected classes,"Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine,450 U.S. 248, 252, n. 5, 101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981), courts must be careful to distinguish between these theories.  Here, respondent did not timely pursue a disparate-impact claim.  Rather, the District Court concluded,  and the Court of Appeals agreed, that respondent's case was limited to a disparate-treatment theory, that the company refused to rehire respondent because it regarded respondent as being disabled and/or because of respondent's record of a disability. 298 F.3d at 1037, n. 20. 

 Petitioner's proffer of its neutral no-rehire policy plainly satisfied its obligation underMcDonnell Douglas to provide a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent.  Thus, the only relevant question before the Court of Appeals, after petitioner presented a neutral explanation for its decision not to rehire respondent, was whether there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that petitioner did make its employment decision based on respondent's status as disabled despite petitioner's proffered explanation.  Instead, the Court of Appeals concluded that, as a matter of law, a neutral no-rehire policy was not  a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason sufficient to defeat a prima facie case  of discrimination. 6The Court of Appeals characterized respondent's workplace misconduct as merely "testing positive because of [his] addiction." 298 F.3d at 1036.  To the extent that the court suggested that, because respondent's workplace misconduct is related to his disability, petitioner's refusal to rehire respondent on account of that workplace misconduct violated the ADA, we point out that we have rejected a similar argument in the context of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.  SeeHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 611, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993). The Court of Appeals did not even attempt, in the remainder of its opinion, to treat this claim as one involving only disparate treatment. Instead, the Court of Appeals observed that petitioner's policy "screens out persons with a record of addiction," and further noted that the company had not raised a business necessity defense,298 F.3d at 1036-1037, and n 19, factors that pertain to disparate-impact claims but not disparate-treatment claims.  See, e.g.,Grano v. Department of Development of Columbus, 637 F.2d 1073, 1081 (CA6 1980) ("In a disparate impact situation . . . the issue is whether a neutral selection device . . . screens out disproportionate numbers of [the protected class]"). 7Indeed, despite the fact that the Nation's antidiscrimination laws are undoubtedly aimed at "the problem of inaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes," ibid., the Court of Appeals held that the unfortunate result of petitioner's application of its neutral policy was that Bockmiller may have made the employment decision in this case "remaining unaware of [respondent's] 'disability.'" 298 F.3d at 1036.  The Court of Appeals did not explain, however, how it could be said that Bockmiller was motivated to reject respondent's application because of his disability if Bockmiller was entirely unaware that such a disability existed.  If Bockmiller were truly unaware that such a disability existed, it would be impossible for her hiring decision to have been based, even in part, on respondent's disability. And, if no part of the hiring decision turned on respondent's status as disabled, he cannot, ipso facto, have been subject to disparate treatment. By improperly focusing on these factors, the Court of Appeals ignored the fact that petitioner's no-rehire policy is a quintessential legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire an employee who was  terminated for violating workplace conduct rules.  If petitioner did indeed apply a neutral, generally applicable no-rehire policy in rejecting respondent's application, petitioner's decision not to rehire respondent can, in no way,  be said to have been motivated by respondent's disability. 

 The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for refusing to rehire respondent because it "serves to bar the re-employment of a drug addict despite his successful rehabilitation." 298 F.3d, at 1036-1037.  We hold that such an analysis is inapplicable to a disparate-treatment claim.  Once respondent had made a prima facie showing of discrimination, the next question for the Court of Appeals was whether petitioner offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions so as to demonstrate that its actions were not motivated by respondent's disability. To the extent that the Court of Appeals strayed from this task by considering not only discriminatory intent but also discriminatory impact, we vacate its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered. 

Justice Souter took no part in the decision of this case.  Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Officers executing a warrant to search for cocaine in respondent Banks's apartment knocked and announced their authority.  The question is whether their 15-to-20-second wait before a forcible entry satisfied the Fourth Amendment and 18 USC § 3109 [18 USCS § 3109].  We hold that it did. 

I 

With information that Banks was selling cocaine at home, North Las Vegas Police Department officers and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents got a warrant to search his two-bedroom apartment. As soon as they arrived there, about 2 o'clock on a Wednesday afternoon, officers posted in front called out "police search warrant" and rapped hard enough on the door to be heard by officers at the back door. Brief for United States 3 (internal quotation marks omitted).  There was no indication whether anyone was home, and after waiting for 15 to 20 seconds with no answer, the officers broke open the front door with a battering ram.  Banks was in the shower and testified that he heard nothing until the crash of the door, which brought him out dripping to confront the police.  The search produced weapons, crack cocaine, and other evidence of drug dealing. 

 In response to drug and firearms charges, Banks moved to suppress evidence, arguing that the officers executing the search warrant waited an unreasonably short time before forcing entry, and so violated both the Fourth Amendment and 18 USC § 3109 [18 USCS § 3109]. 1 The statute provides: "The officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant."The District Court denied the motion, and Banks pleaded guilty, reserving his right to challenge the search on appeal. 

 A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed and ordered suppression of the evidence found. 282 F.3d 699 (CA9 2002).  In assessing the reasonableness of the execution of the warrant, the panel majority set out a nonexhaustive list of "factors that an officer reasonably should consider" in deciding when to enter premises identified in a warrant, after knocking and announcing their  presence but receiving no express acknowledgment: "(a) size of the residence; (b) location of the residence; (c) location of the officers in relation to the main living or sleeping areas of the residence; (d) time of day; (e) nature of the suspected offense; (f) evidence demonstrating the suspect's guilt; (g) suspect's prior convictions and, if any, the type of offense for which he was convicted; and (h) any other observations triggering the senses of the officers that reasonably would lead one to believe that immediate entry was necessary." Id., at 704.

 The majority also defined four categories of intrusion after knock and announcement, saying that the classification "aids in the resolution of the essential question whether the entry made herein was reasonable under the circumstances": "(1) entries in which exigent circumstances exist and non-forcible entry is possible, permitting entry to be made simultaneously with or shortly after announcement; (2) entries in which exigent circumstances exist and forced entry by destruction of property is required, necessitating more specific inferences of exigency; (3) entries in which no exigent circumstances exist and non-forcible entry is possible, requiring an explicit refusal of admittance or a lapse of a significant amount of time; and (4) entries in which no exigent circumstances exist and forced entry by destruction of property is required, mandating an explicit refusal of admittance or a  lapse of an even more substantial amount of time." Ibid.

The panel majority put the action of the officers here in the last category, on the understanding that they destroyed the door without hearing anything to suggest a refusal to admit even though sound traveled easily through the small apartment. The majority held the 15-to-20-second delay after knocking and announcing to be "[in]sufficient . . . to satisfy the constitutional safeguards." Id., at 705. 

Judge Fisher dissented, saying that the majority ought to come out the other way based on the very grounds it stressed: Banks's small apartment, the loud knock and announcement, the suspected offense of dealing in cocaine, and the time of the day.  Judge Fisher thought the lapse of 15 to 20 seconds was enough to support a reasonable inference that admittance had been constructively denied. Id., at 710. 

We granted certiorari to consider how to go about applying the standard of reasonableness to the length of time police with a warrant must wait before entering without permission after knocking and announcing their intent in a felony case.  537 U.S. 1187, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1018, 123 S. Ct. 1252 (2003).  We now reverse. 

II 

 There has never been a dispute that these officers were obliged to knock and announce their intentions when executing the search warrant, an obligation they concededly honored.  Despite this agreement, we start with a word about standards for requiring or dispensing with a knock and announcement, since the same criteria bear on when the officers could legitimately enter after knocking. 

 The Fourth Amendment says nothing specific about formalities in exercising a warrant's authorization, speaking to the manner of searching as well as to the legitimacy of searching at all simply in terms of the right to be "secure . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures." Although the notion of reasonable execution must therefore be fleshed  out, we have done that case by case, largely avoiding categories and protocols for searches.  Instead, we have treated reasonableness as a function of the facts of cases so various that no template is likely to produce sounder results than examining the totality of circumstances in a given case; it is too hard to invent categories without giving short shrift to details that turn out to be important in a given instance, and without inflating marginal ones.  See, e.g.,Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39, 136 L. Ed. 2d 347, 117 S. Ct. 417 (1996) ("[W]e have consistently eschewed bright-line rules, instead emphasizing the fact-specific nature of the reasonableness inquiry");Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 33, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726, 83 S. Ct. 1623 (1963) (reasonableness not susceptible to Procrustean application);Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U.S. 344, 357, 75 L. Ed. 374, 51 S. Ct. 153 (1931) (no formula for determining reasonableness; each case on its own facts and circumstances).  We have, however, pointed out factual considerations of unusual, albeit not dispositive, significance. 

 InWilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S. 927, 131 L. Ed. 2d 976, 115 S. Ct. 1914 (1995), we held that the common law knock-and-announce principle is one focus of the reasonableness enquiry; and we subsequently decided that although the standard generally requires the police to announce their intent to search before entering closed premises, the obligation gives way when officers "have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or . . . would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence,"Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 394, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615, 117 S. Ct. 1416 (1997).  When a warrant applicant gives reasonable grounds to expect futility or to suspect that one or another such exigency already exists or will arise instantly upon knocking, a magistrate judge is acting within the Constitution to authorize a "no-knock" entry. 2Some States give magistrate judges the authority to issue "no-knock" warrants, and some do not.  See, e.g.,Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 396, n. 7, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615, 117 S. Ct. 1416 (1997) (collecting state statutes and cases).And even when executing a warrant silent about  that, if circumstances support a reasonable suspicion of exigency when the officers arrive at the door, they may go straight in. Id., at 394, 396, n. 7, 137 L. Ed. 2d 615, 117 S. Ct. 1416.

 Since most people keep their doors locked, entering without knocking will normally do some damage, a circumstance too common to require a heightened justification when a reasonable suspicion of exigency already justifies an unwarned entry.  We have accordingly held that police in exigent circumstances may damage premises so far as necessary for a no-knock entrance without demonstrating the suspected risk in any more detail than the law demands for an unannounced intrusion simply by lifting the latch. United States v. Ramirez, 523 U.S. 65, 70-71, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992 (1998).  Either way, it is enough that the officers had a reasonable suspicion of exigent circumstances. 3The standard for a no-knock entry stated inRichards applies on reasonable suspicion of exigency or futility. Because the facts here go to exigency, not futility, we speak of that alone.

 III 

Like Ramirez, this case turns on the significance of exigency revealed by circumstances known to the officers, for the only substantive difference between the two situations goes to the time at which the officers reasonably anticipated some danger calling for action without delay. 4Ramirez and Richards, our cases addressing the role of exigency in assessing the reasonableness of a no-knock entry, involved searches by warrant for evidence of a felony, as does this case.  In a different context governed by the Fourth Amendment, we have held that the risk of losing evidence of a minor offense is insufficient to make it reasonable to enter a dwelling to make a warrantless arrest.  See Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 80 L. Ed. 2d 732, 104 S. Ct. 2091 (1984).  Courts of Appeals have applied Welsh to warrantless entries simply to search for evidence, considering the gravity of the offense in determining whether exigent circumstances exist.  See, e.g.,United States v. Aquino, 836 F.2d 1268, 1271-1273 (CA10 1988);United States v. Clement, 854 F.2d 1116, 1120 (CA8 1988).  We intimate nothing here about such warrantless entry cases.  Nor do we express a view on the significance of the existence of a warrant in evaluating whether exigency justifies action in knock-and-announce cases when the reason for the search is a minor offense. Whereas the Ramirez Magistrate Judge found in advance that the customary warning would raise an immediate risk that a wanted felon would elude capture or pose a threat to the officers, see id., at 68, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992, here the Government claims that a risk of losing evidence arose shortly after knocking and announcing. Although the police concededly arrived at Banks's door without reasonable suspicion of facts justifying a no-knock entry, they argue that announcing their presence started the clock running toward the moment of apprehension that Banks would flush away the easily disposable cocaine, prompted by knowing the police would soon be coming in.  While it was held reasonable for the police in Ramirez to enter forcibly upon arrival, the Government argues it was equally reasonable for the officers to go in with force here as soon as the danger of disposal had ripened. 

 Banks does not, of course, deny that exigency may develop in the period beginning when officers with a warrant knock to be admitted, and the issue comes down to whether it was reasonable to suspect imminent loss of evidence after the 15 to 20 seconds the officers waited prior to forcing their way.  Though we agree with Judge Fisher's dissenting opinion that this call is a close one,282 F.3d at 707, we think that after 15 or 20 seconds without a response, police could fairly suspect that cocaine would be gone if they were reticent any longer.  Courts of Appeals have, indeed, routinely held similar wait times to be reasonable in drug cases with similar facts including easily disposable evidence (and some courts have found even shorter ones to be reasonable enough). 5Several Courts of Appeals have explicitly taken into account the risk of disposal of drug evidence as a factor in evaluating the reasonableness of waiting time.  See, e.g.,United States v. Goodson, 165 F.3d 610, 612, 614 (CA8 1999) (holding a 20-second wait after a loud announcement at a one-story ranch reasonable);United States v. Spikes, 158 F.3d 913, 925-927 (CA6 1998) (holding a 15-to-30-second wait in midmorning after a loud announcement reasonable);United States v. Spriggs, 302 U.S. App. D.C. 54, 996 F.2d 320, 322-323 (CADC 1993) (holding a 15-second wait after a reasonably audible announcement at 7:45 a.m. on a weekday reasonable);United States v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1168 (CA1 1993) (holding a 10-second wait after a loud announcement reasonable); United States v. Jones, 133 F.3d 358, 361-362 (CA5 1998) (relying specifically on the concept of exigency, holding a 15-to-20-second wait reasonable).  See alsoUnited States v. Chavez-Miranda, 306 F.3d 973, 981-982, n. 7 (CA9 2002) ("Banks appears to be a departure from our prior decisions.  . . .  [W]e have found a 10 to 20 second wait to be reasonable in similar circumstances, albeit when the police heard sounds after the knock and announcement");United States v. Jenkins, 175 F.3d 1208, 1215 (CA10 1999) (holding a 14-to-20-second wait at 10 a.m. reasonable);United States v. Markling, 7 F.3d 1309, 1318-1319 (CA7 1993) (holding a 7-second wait at a small motel room reasonable when officers acted on a specific tip that the suspect was likely to dispose of the drugs).

 A look at Banks's counterarguments  shows why these courts reached sensible results, for each of his reasons for saying that 15 to 20 seconds was too brief rests on a mistake about the relevant enquiry: the fact that he was actually in the shower and did not hear the officers is not to the point, and the same is true of the claim that it might have taken him longer than 20 seconds if he had heard the knock and headed straight for the door. As for the shower, it is enough to say that the facts known to the police are what count in judging reasonable waiting time, cf., e.g.,Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396, 104 L. Ed. 2d 443, 109 S. Ct. 1865 (1989) ("The 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight."), and there is no indication that the police knew that Banks was in the shower and thus unaware of an impending search that he would otherwise have tried to frustrate. 

 And the argument that 15 to 20 seconds was too short for Banks to have come to the door ignores the very risk that justified prompt entry.  True, if the officers were to justify their timing here by claiming that Banks's failure to admit them fairly suggested a refusal to let them in, Banks could at least argue that no such suspicion can arise until an occupant  has had time to get to the door, 6It is probably unrealistic even on its own terms.  The apartment was "small,"282 F.3d 699, 704 (CA9 2002), and a man may walk the length of today's small apartment in 15 seconds. a time that will vary with the size of the establishment, perhaps five seconds to open a motel room door, or several minutes to move through a townhouse.  In this case, however, the police claim exigent need to enter, and the crucial fact in examining their actions is not time to reach the door but the particular exigency claimed.  On the record here, what matters is the opportunity to get rid of cocaine, which a prudent dealer will keep near a commode or kitchen sink.  The significant circumstances include the arrival of the police during the day, when anyone inside would probably have been up and around, and the sufficiency of 15 to 20 seconds for getting to the bathroom or the kitchen to start flushing cocaine down the drain.  That is, when circumstances are exigent because a pusher may be near the point of putting his drugs beyond reach, it is imminent disposal, not travel time to the entrance, that governs when the police may reasonably enter; since the bathroom and kitchen are usually in the interior of a dwelling, not the front hall, there is no reason generally to peg the travel time to the location of the door, and no reliable  basis for giving the proprietor of a mansion a longer wait than the resident of a bungalow, or an apartment like Banks's.  And 15 to 20 seconds does not seem an unrealistic guess about the time someone would need to get in a position to rid his quarters of cocaine. 

 Once the exigency had matured, of course, the officers were not bound to learn anything more or wait any longer before going in, even though their entry entailed some harm to the building.  Ramirez held that the exigent need of law enforcement trumps a resident's interest in avoiding all property damage, see523 U.S. 65, 70-71, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992 (1998), and there is no reason to treat a post-knock exigency differently from the no-knock counterpart inRamirez itself. 

 IV 

 Our emphasis on totality analysis necessarily rejects positions taken on each side of this case.  Ramirez, for example, cannot be read with the breadth the Government espouses, as "reflect[ing] a general principle that the need to damage property in order to effectuate an entry to execute a search warrant should not be part of the analysis of whether the entry itself was reasonable." Brief for the United States 18; Reply Brief for United States 4.  At common law, the knock-and-announce rule was traditionally "justified in part by the belief that announcement generally would avoid 'the destruction or breaking of any house . . . by which great damage and inconvenience might ensue.'" Wilson, 514 U.S., at 935-936, 131 L. Ed. 2d 976, 115 S. Ct. 1914 (quoting Semayne's Case, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 91b, 77 Eng. Rep. 194, 196 (K. B. 1603)). One point in making an officer knock and announce, then, is to give a person inside the chance to save his door. That is why, in the case with no reason to suspect an immediate risk of frustration or futility in waiting at all, the reasonable wait time may well be longer when police make a forced entry, since they ought to be more certain the occupant has had time to answer the door. It is hard to be more definite than that, without turning the notion of a reasonable time under all the circumstances into a set of sub-rules as the Ninth Circuit has been inclined to do.  Suffice it to say that the need to damage property in the course of getting in is a good reason to require more patience than it would be reasonable to expect if the door were open.  Police seeking a stolen piano may be able to spend more time to make sure they really need the battering ram. 

 On the other side, we disapprove of the Court of Appeals's four-part scheme for vetting knock-and-announce entries.  To begin with, the demand for enhanced evidence of exigency before a door can reasonably be damaged by a warranted no-knock intrusion was already bad law before the Court of Appeals decided this case.  In Ramirez (a case from the Ninth Circuit), we rejected an attempt to subdivide felony cases by accepting "mild exigency" for entry without property damage, but requiring "more specific inferences of exigency" before damage would be reasonable. 523 U.S., at 69-71, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court of Appeals did not cite Ramirez. 

Nor did the appeals court citeUnited States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 151 L. Ed. 2d 740, 122 S. Ct. 744 (2002) (again, from the Ninth Circuit).  There, we recently disapproved a framework for making reasonable suspicion determinations that attempted to reduce what the Circuit described as "troubling . . . uncertainty" in reasonableness analysis, by "describ[ing] and clearly delimit[ing]" an officer's consideration of certain factors. Id., at 272, 275, 151 L. Ed. 2d 740, 122 S. Ct. 744 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, as inArvizu, the Court of Appeals's overlay of a categorical scheme on the general reasonableness analysis threatens to distort the "totality of the circumstances" principle, by replacing a stress on revealing facts with resort to pigeonholes. Id., at 274, 151 L. Ed. 2d 740, 122 S. Ct. 744 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Attention to cocaine rocks and pianos tells a lot about the chances of their respective disposal and its bearing on reasonable time.  Instructions couched in terms like "significant amount of time," and "an even more substantial amount of time,"282 F.3d at 704, tell very little. 

V 

 Last, there is Banks's claim that the entry violated 18 USC § 3109 [18 USCS § 3109]. Ramirez held that the result should be the same under the Fourth Amendment and § 3109, permitting an officer to enter by force "if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance." We explained the statute's "'requirement of prior notice . . . before forcing entry . . . [as] codif[ying] a tradition embedded in Anglo-American law,'" 523 U.S., at 72, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992 (quotingMiller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 313, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1332, 78 S. Ct. 1190 (1958)); see alsoSabbath v. United States, 391 U.S. 585, 591, n. 8, 20 L. Ed. 2d 828, 88 S. Ct. 1755 (1968), and we held that § 3109 implicates the exceptions to the common law knock-and-announce requirement that inform the Fourth Amendment itself, 523 U.S., at 73, 140 L. Ed. 2d 191, 118 S. Ct. 992.  The upshot is that § 3109 is subject to an exigent circumstances exception, ibid., which qualifies the requirement of refusal after notice, just as it qualifies the obligation to announce in the first place.  Absent exigency, the police must knock and receive an actual refusal or wait out the time necessary to infer one.  But in a case like this, where the officers knocked and announced their presence, and forcibly entered after a reasonable suspicion of exigency had ripened, their entry satisfied § 3109 as well as the Fourth Amendment, even without refusal of admittance. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. 

So ordered.  


Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 In the early morning hours a passenger car occupied by three men was stopped for speeding by a police officer. The  officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cash from the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat. After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money, the officer arrested each of them.  We hold that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle--one of the three men. 

At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Police officer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding.  There were three occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver and owner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, and Otis Smith, the back-seat passenger. The officer asked Partlow for his license and registration.  When Partlow opened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-up money in the glove compartment. The officer returned to his patrol car with Partlow's license and registration to check the computer system for outstanding violations.  The computer check did not reveal any violations.  The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issued him an oral warning. 

After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlow if he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle.  Partlow indicated that he did not.  Partlow then consented to a search of the vehicle.  The search yielded $763 from the glove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest. When the officer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat. The officer pulled down the armrest and found  the drugs, which had been placed between the armrest and the back seat of the car. 

The officer questioned all three men about the ownership of the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest them all.  The men offered no information regarding the ownership of the drugs or money.  All three were placed under arrest and transported to the police station. 

Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights underMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), and gave an oral and written confession in which he acknowledged that the cocaine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going to a party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or "[u]se it for sex." App. 26.  Pringle maintained that the other occupants of the car did not know about the drugs, and they were released. 

 The trial court denied Pringle's motion to suppress his confession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that the officer had probable cause to arrest Pringle.  A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to 10 years' incarceration without the possibility of parole.  The Court of Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed. 141 Md. App. 292, 785 A.2d 790 (2001). 

The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to show Pringle's knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs, "the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when [Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by its owner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrest for possession." 370 Md. 525, 545, 805 A.2d 1016, 1027 (2002).  We granted certiorari538 U.S. 921, 155 L. Ed. 2d 311, 123 S. Ct. 1571 (2003), and now reverse. 

 Under the Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,Mapp v. Ohio,367 U.S. 643, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 86 Ohio Law Abs. 513 (1961), the people are "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, . . . and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . ." U.S. Const., Amdt. 4. Maryland law authorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests, inter alia, for felonies committed in an officer's presence or where an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony  has been committed or is being committed in the officer's presence. Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, § 594B (1996) (repealed 2001).  A warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer's presence, is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if the arrest is supported by probable cause. United States v. Watson,423 U.S. 411, 424, 46 L. Ed. 2d 598, 96 S. Ct. 820 (1976); seeAtwater v. Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 354, 149 L. Ed. 2d 549, 121 S. Ct. 1536 (2001) (stating that "[i]f an officer has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence, he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrest the offender"). 

 It is uncontested in the present case that the officer, upon recovering the five plastic glassine baggies containing suspected cocaine, had  probable cause to believe a felony had been committed.  Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, § 287 (1996) (repealed 2002) (prohibiting possession of controlled dangerous substances).  The sole question is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle committed that crime. 1Maryland law defines "possession" as "the exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons." Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, § 277(s) (1996) (repealed 2002).

 The long-prevailing standard of probable cause protects "citizens from rash and unreasonable interferences with privacy and from unfounded charges of crime," while giving "fair leeway for enforcing the law in the community's protection." Brinegar v. United States,338 U.S. 160, 176, 93 L. Ed. 1879, 69 S. Ct. 1302 (1949).  On many occasions, we have reiterated that the probable-cause standard is a "'practical, nontechnical conception'" that deals with "'the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.'" Illinois v. Gates,462 U.S. 213, 231, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (1983) (quotingBrinegar, supra, at 175-176, 93 L. Ed. 1879, 69 S. Ct. 1302); see, e.g.,Ornelas v. United States,517 U.S. 690, 695, 134 L. Ed. 2d 911, 116 S. Ct. 1657 (1996);United States v. Sokolow,490 U.S. 1, 7-8, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1, 109 S. Ct. 1581 (1989).  "[P]robable cause is a fluid  concept--turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts--not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules." Gates, 462 U.S., at 232, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317. 

The probable-cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification into percentages because it deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances.  See ibid.;Brinegar, 338 U.S., at 175, 93 L. Ed. 1879, 69 S. Ct. 1302.  We have stated, however, that "[t]he substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt," ibid. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized,Ybarra v. Illinois,444 U.S. 85, 91, 62 L. Ed. 2d 238, 100 S. Ct. 338 (1979).  In Illinois v Gates, we noted: "As early asLocke v. United States,11 U.S. 339, 7 Cranch 339, 348, [3 L. Ed. 364] (1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a closely related context:  '[T]he term "probable cause," according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation . . . .  It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion.' More recently, we said that 'the quanta . . . of proof' appropriate in ordinary judicial proceedings are inapplicable to the decision to issue a warrant. Brinegar, 338 U.S., at 173 [93 L. Ed. 1879, 69 S. Ct. 1302].  Finely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the [probable-cause] decision." 462 U.S., at 235, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317.

To determine whether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to the arrest, and then decide "whether these historical facts, viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer, amount to" probable cause,Ornelas,  supra, at 696, 134 L. Ed. 2d 911, 116 S. Ct. 1657. 

 In this case, Pringle was one of three men riding in a Nissan Maxima at 3:16 a.m. There was $763 of rolled-up cash  in the glove compartment directly in front of Pringle. 2 The Court of Appeals of Maryland dismissed the $763 seized from the glove compartment as a factor in the probable-cause determination, stating that "[m]oney, without more, is innocuous."  370 Md. 524, 546, 805 A.2d 1016, 1028 (2002).  The court's consideration of the money in isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances, is mistaken in light of our precedents.  See, e.g.,Illinois v. Gates,462 U.S. 213, 230-231, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (1983) (opining that the totality of the circumstances approach is consistent with our prior treatment of probable cause);Brinegar v. United States,338 U.S. 160, 175-176, 93 L. Ed. 1879, 69 S. Ct. 1302 (1949) ("Probable cause exists where 'the facts and circumstances within their [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that' an offense has been or is being committed").  We think it is abundantly clear from the facts that this case involves more than money alone. Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seat armrest and accessible to all three men.  Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money. 

 We think it an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledge of, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine. Thus a reasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine, either solely or jointly. 

Pringle's attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-by-association case is unavailing.  His reliance onYbarra v. Illinois, supra, andUnited States v. Di Re,332 U.S. 581, 92 L. Ed. 210, 68 S. Ct. 222 (1948), is misplaced.  In Ybarra, police officers obtained a warrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidence of possession of a controlled substance.  Upon entering the tavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the customers present in the tavern, including Ybarra.  Inside a cigarette pack retrieved from Ybarra's pocket, an officer found six tinfoil packets containing heroin.  We stated: "[A] person's mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more,  give rise to probable cause to search that person. Sibron v. New York,392 U.S. 40, 62-63, [20 L. Ed. 2d 917, 88 S. Ct. 1889] (1968).  Where the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.  This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be." 444 U.S., at 91, 62 L. Ed. 2d 238, 100 S. Ct. 338.

We held that the search warrant did not permit body searches of all of the tavern's patrons and that the police could not pat down the patrons for weapons, absent individualized suspicion. Id., at 92, 62 L. Ed. 2d 238, 100 S. Ct. 338. 

This case is quite different fromYbarra Pringle and his two companions were in a relatively small automobile, not a public tavern. InWyoming v. Houghton, 526 U.S. 295, 143 L. Ed. 2d 408, 119 S. Ct. 1297 (1999),  we noted that "a car passenger--unlike the unwitting tavern patron in Ybarra--will often be engaged in a common enterprise with the driver, and have the same interest in concealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing." Id., at 304-305, 143 L. Ed. 2d 408, 119 S. Ct. 1297.  Here we think it was reasonable for the officer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.  The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer would be unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potential to furnish evidence against him. 

In Di Re, a federal investigator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was to receive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certain Buttitta at a particular place.  The investigator went to the appointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rear seat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons. There were two other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the driver's seat and Di Re in the front passenger's seat. Reed informed the investigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons. Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched. After noting that the officers had no information implicating  Di Re and no information pointing to Di Re's possession of coupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference, we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believe that Di Re was involved in the crime. 332 U.S., at 592-594, 92 L. Ed. 210, 68 S. Ct. 222.  We said "[a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of a crime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person." Id., at 594, 92 L. Ed. 210, 68 S. Ct. 222.  No such singling out occurred in this case; none of the three men provided information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or money. 

 We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance.  Pringle's arrest therefore did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Under a longstanding practice, a court sometimes treats as a request for habeas relief under 28 USC § 2255 [28 USCS § 2255] a motion that a pro se federal prisoner has labeled differently.  Such recharacterization can have serious consequences for the prisoner, for it subjects any subsequent motion under § 2255 to the restrictive conditions that federal law imposes upon a "second or successive" (but not upon a first) federal habeas motion.  § 2255, P8.  In light of these consequences, we hold that the court cannot so recharacterize a pro se litigant's motion as the litigant's first § 2255 motion unless the court informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize, warns the litigant that the recharacterization will subject subsequent § 2255 motions to the law's "second or successive" restrictions, and provides the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw, or to amend, the filing.  Where these things are not done, a recharacterized motion will not count as a § 2255 motion for purposes of applying § 2255's "second or successive" provision.

(2) The Government, in its response, said that Castro's claims were "more properly cognizable" as federal habeas corpus claims, i.e., claims made under the authority of 28 USC § 2255 [28 USCS § 2255].  But, the Government added, it did not object to the court's considering Castro's motion as having invoked both Rule 33 and § 2255. 

(3) The District Court denied Castro's motion on the merits.  In its accompanying opinion, the court generally referred to Castro's motion as a Rule 33 motion; but the court twice referred to it as a § 2255 motion as well.  App. 137-144. 

 (4) Castro, still acting pro se, appealed, but he did not challenge the District Court's recharacterization of his motion. 

(5) The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed.  It said in its one-paragraph order that it was ruling on a motion based upon both Rule 33 and § 2255.  Judgt. order reported at82 F.3d 429 (11 Cir. 1996); App. 147. 

B 

The relevant facts surrounding the 1997 motion are the following: 

 (1) On April 18, 1997, Castro, acting pro se, filed what he called a § 2255 motion.  The motion included claims not raised in the 1994 motion, including a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. 

(2) The District Court denied the motion; Castro appealed; and the Court of Appeals remanded for further consideration of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  It also asked the District Court to consider whether, in light of the 1994 motion, Castro's motion was his second § 2255 motion, rather than his first. 

(3) On remand, the District Court appointed counsel for Castro.  It then decided that the 1997 motion was indeed  Castro's second § 2255 motion (the 1994 motion being his first).  And it dismissed the motion for failure to comply with one of § 2255's restrictive "second or successive" conditions (namely, Castro's failure to obtain the Court of Appeals' permission to file a "second or successive" motion).  § 2255, P 8.  The District Court granted Castro a certificate to appeal its "second or successive" determination.  § 2253(c)(1). 

(4) The Eleventh Circuit affirmed by a split (2-to-1) vote. 290 F.3d 1270 (2002).  The majority "suggested" and "urged" district courts in the future to "warn prisoners of the consequences of recharacterization and provide them with the opportunity to amend or dismiss their filings." Id., at 1273, 1274.  But it held that the 1994 court's failure to do so did not legally undermine its recharacterization. Hence, Castro's current § 2255 motion was indeed his second habeas motion. Id., at 1274. 

Other Circuits have taken a different approach.  E.g.,United States v. Palmer, 353 U.S. App. D.C. 128, 296 F.3d 1135, 1145-1147 (CADC 2002) (announcing a rule requiring courts to notify pro se litigants prior to recharacterization and refusing to find the § 2255 motion before it "second or successive" since such notice was lacking).  We consequently granted Castro's petition for certiorari. 

II 

 We begin with a jurisdictional matter.  We asked the parties to consider the relevance of a provision in the federal habeas corpus statutes that says that the "grant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application . . . shall not be the subject of a petition for . . . a writ of certiorari." 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(E) [28 USCS § 2244(b)(3)(E)].

After receiving the parties' responses, we conclude that this provision does not bar our review here. 

Castro's appeal to the Eleventh Circuit did not concern an "authorization . . . to file a second or successive application."  The District Court certified for appeal the question whether Castro's § 2255 motion was his first such motion or his second.  Castro then argued to the Eleventh Circuit that his § 2255 motion was his first; and he asked the court to reverse the District Court's dismissal of that motion.  He nowhere asked the Court of Appeals to grant, and it nowhere denied, any "authorization . . . to file a second or successive application." 

 The Government argues that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion had the effect of denying "authorization . . . to file a second . . . application" because the court said in its opinion that Castro's motion could not meet  the requirements for second or successive motions. 290 F.3d at 1273.  For that reason, the Government concludes, the court's decision falls within the scope of the jurisdictional provision.  Brief for United States 16. 

In our view, however, this argument stretches the words of the statute too far.  Given the context, we cannot take these words in the opinion as a statutorily relevant "denial" of a request that was not made.  Even if, for argument's sake, we were to accept the Government's characterization, the argument nonetheless would founder on the statute's requirement that the "denial" must be the "subject" of the certiorari petition.  The "subject" of Castro's petition is not the Court of Appeals' "denial of an authorization." It is the lower courts' refusal to recognize that this § 2255 motion is his first, not his second.  That is a very different question.  Cf. Adamo Wrecking Co. v. United States, 434 U.S. 275, 282-283, 54 L. Ed. 2d 538, 98 S. Ct. 566 (1978) (statute barring court review of lawfulness of agency "emission standard" in criminal case does not bar court review of whether regulation is an "emission standard"). 

Moreover, reading the statute as the Government suggests would produce troublesome results.  It would create procedural anomalies, allowing review where the lower court decision disfavors, but denying review where it favors, the Government.  Cf.Stewartv. Martinez-Villareal, 523 U.S. 637, 641-642, 140 L. Ed. 2d 849, 118 S. Ct. 1618 (1998) (allowing the Government to obtain review of a decision that a habeas corpus application is not "second or successive").  It would close our doors to a class of habeas petitioners seeking review without any clear indication that such was Congress' intent.  Cf.Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 660-661, 135 L. Ed. 2d 827, 116 S. Ct. 2333 (1996).And any such conclusion would prove difficult to reconcile with the basic principle that we "read limitations on our jurisdiction to review narrowly." Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 463, 153 L. Ed. 2d 453, 122 S. Ct. 2191 (2002). 

We conclude that we have the power to review Castro's claim, and we turn to the merits of that claim. 

III 

Federal courts sometimes will ignore the legal label that a pro se litigant attaches to a motion and recharacterize the motion in order to place it within a different legal category.  See, e.g.,Raineri v. United States, 233 F.3d 96, 100 (CA1 2000); United States v. Detrich, 940 F.2d 37, 38 (CA2 1991);United States v. Miller, 197 F.3d 644, 648 (CA3 1999);Raines v. United States, 423 F.2d 526, 528, n. 1 (CA4 1970);United States v. Santora, 711 F.2d 41, 42 (CA5 1983);United States v. McDowell, 305 F.2d 12, 14 (CA6 1962); Henderson v. United States, 264 F.3d 709, 711 (CA7 2001);McIntyrev. United States, 508 F.2d 403, n. 1 (CA8 1975)(per curiam);United States v. Eatinger, 902 F.2d 1383, 1385 (CA9 1990)(per curiam);United States v. Kelly, 235 F.3d 1238, 1242 (CA10 2000);United States v. Jordan, 915 F.2d 622, 625 (CA11 1990);United States v. Tindle, 173 U.S. App. D.C. 77, 522 F.2d 689, 693 (CADC 1975)(per curiam). They may do so in order to avoid an unnecessary dismissal, e.g.,id., at 692-693, to avoid inappropriately stringent application of formal labeling requirements, seeHaines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652, 92 S. Ct. 594 (1972)(per curiam), or to create  a better correspondence between the substance of a pro se motion's claim and its underlying legal basis.   SeeHughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 10, 66 L. Ed. 2d 163, 101 S. Ct. 173 (1980)(per curiam);Andrews v. United States, 373 U.S. 334, 10 L. Ed. 2d 383, 83 S. Ct. 1236 (1963). 

 We here address one aspect of this practice, namely, certain legal limits that nine Circuits have placed on recharacterization. Those Circuits recognize that, by recharacterizing as a first § 2255 motion a pro se litigant's filing that did not previously bear that label, the court may make it significantly more difficult for that litigant to file another such motion.  They have consequently concluded that a district court may not recharacterize a pro se litigant's motion as a request for relief under § 2255 --unless the court first warns the pro se litigant about the consequences of the recharacterization, thereby giving the litigant an opportunity to contest the recharacterization, or to withdraw or amend the motion.  SeeAdams v. United States, 155 F.3d 582, 583 (CA2 1998)(per curiam);United States v. Miller, supra, at 646-647 (CA3);United States v. Emmanuel, 288 F.3d 644, 646-647 (CA4 2002);In re Shelton, 295 F.3d 620, 622 (CA6 2002)(per curiam);Henderson v. United States, supra, at 710-711 (CA7);Morales v. United States, 304 F.3d 764, 767 (CA8 2002);United States v. Seesing, 234 F.3d 456, 463 (CA9 2000);United States v. Kelly, supra, at 1240-1241 (CA10);United States v. Palmer, 296 F.3d at 1146 (CADC); see also290 F.3d at 1273, 1274 (case below) (suggesting that courts provide such warnings). 

No one here contests the lawfulness of this judicially created requirement.  The Government suggests that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 47 provides adequate underlying legal authority for the procedural practice.  Brief for United States 42.  It suggests that this Court has the authority to regulate the practice through "the exercise" of our "supervisory powers" over the federal judiciary.  E.g.,McNabb v. United States,318 U.S. 332, 340-341, 87 L. Ed. 819, 63 S. Ct. 608 (1943).  And it notes that limiting the courts' authority to recharacterize, approximately as the Courts of Appeals have done,  "is likely to reduce and simplify litigation over questions of characterization, which are often quite difficult." Brief for United States 42. 

We agree with these suggestions.  We consequently hold, as almost every Court of Appeals has already held, that the lower courts' recharacterization powers are limited in the following way: 

The limitation applies when a court recharacterizes a pro se litigant's motion as a first § 2255 motion. In such circumstances the district court must notify the pro se litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent § 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on "second or successive" motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the § 2255 claims he believes he has.  If the court fails to do so, the motion cannot be considered to have become a § 2255 motion for purposes of applying to later motions the law's "second or successive" restrictions.  § 2255, P 8. 

IV 

 The District Court that considered  Castro's 1994 motion failed to give Castro warnings of the kind we have described.  Moreover, this Court's "supervisory power" determinations normally apply, like other judicial decisions, retroactively, at least to the case in which the determination was made. McNabb, supra, at 347, 87 L. Ed. 819, 63 S. Ct. 608 (applying new supervisory rule to case before the Court).  Hence, given our holding in Part III, supra, Castro's 1994 motion cannot be considered a first § 2255 motion, and his 1997 motion cannot be considered a "second or successive" motion--unless there is something special about Castro's case. 

The Government argues that there is something special: Castro failed to appeal the 1994 recharacterization. According to the Government, that fact makes the 1994 recharacterization valid as a matter of "law of the case." And, since the 1994 recharacterization is valid, the 1997 § 2255 motion is Castro's second, not his first. 

We do not agree.  No Circuit that has considered whether to treat a § 2255 motion as successive (based on a prior unwarned recharacterization) has found that the litigant's failure to challenge that recharacterization makes a difference.  SeePalmer, supra, at 1147; see alsoHenderson, supra, at 711-712;Raineri, 233 F.3d at 100;In re Shelton, supra, at 622.  That is not surprising, for the very point of the warning is to help the pro se litigant understand not only (1) whether he should withdraw or amend his motion, but also (2) whether he should contest the recharacterization, say, on appeal.  The "lack of warning" prevents his making an informed judgment in respect to the latter just as it does in respect to the former.  Indeed, an unwarned pro se litigant's failure to appeal a recharacterization simply underscores the practical importance of providing the warning. Hence, an unwarned recharacterization cannot count as a § 2255 motion for purposes of the "second or successive" provision, whether the unwarned pro se litigant does, or does not, take an appeal. 

The law of the case doctrine cannot pose an insurmountable obstacle to our reaching this conclusion.  Assuming for argument's sake that the doctrine applies here, it simply "expresses" common judicial "practice"; it does not "limit" the courts' power.  SeeMessenger v. Anderson, 225 U.S. 436, 444, 56 L. Ed. 1152, 32 S. Ct. 739 (1912) (Holmes, J.).  It cannot prohibit a court from disregarding an earlier holding in an appropriate case which, for the reasons set forth, we find this case to be. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

So ordered.  


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This Fourth Amendment case focuses upon a highway checkpoint where police stopped motorists to ask them for information about a recent hit-and-run accident.  We hold that the police stops were reasonable, hence, constitutional. 

 I 

The relevant background is as follows: On Saturday, August 23, 1997, just after midnight, an unknown motorist traveling eastbound on a highway in Lombard, Illinois, struck and killed a 70-year-old bicyclist.  The motorist drove off without identifying himself.  About one week later at about the same time of night and at about the same place, local police set up a highway checkpoint designed to obtain more information about the accident from the motoring public. 

Police cars with flashing lights partially blocked the eastbound lanes of the highway. The blockage forced traffic to slow down, leading to lines of up to 15 cars in each lane.  As each vehicle drew up to the checkpoint, an officer would stop it for 10 to 15 seconds, ask the occupants whether they had seen anything happen there the previous weekend, and hand each driver a flyer. The flyer said "ALERT . . . FATAL HIT & RUN ACCIDENT" and requested "assistance in identifying the vehicle and driver in this accident which killed a 70 year old bicyclist." App. 9. 

Robert Lidster, the respondent, drove a minivan toward the checkpoint. As he approached the checkpoint, his van swerved, nearly hitting one of the officers.  The officer smelled alcohol on Lidster's breath.  He directed Lidster to a side street where another officer administered a sobriety test and then arrested Lidster.  Lidster was tried and convicted in Illinois state court of driving under the influence of alcohol. 

Lidster challenged the lawfulness of his arrest and conviction on the ground that the government had obtained much of the relevant evidence through use of a checkpoint stop that violated the Fourth Amendment. The trial court rejected that challenge.  But an Illinois appellate court reached the opposite conclusion.  319 Ill. App. 3d 825, 747 N.E.2d 419, 254 Ill. Dec. 379 (2001).  The Illinois Supreme Court agreed  with the appellate  court.  It held (by a vote of 4 to 3) that our decision in Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447 (2000), required it to find the stop unconstitutional.202 Ill. 2d 1, 779 N.E.2d 855, 269 Ill. Dec. 1 (2002). 

Because lower courts have reached different conclusions about this matter, we granted certiorari.  See Burns v. Commonwealth, 261 Va. 307, 541 S. E. 2d 872, cert denied, 534 U.S. 1043, 151 L. Ed. 2d 542, 122 S. Ct. 621 (2001) (finding similar checkpoint stop constitutional).  We now reverse the Illinois Supreme Court's determination. 

II 

The Illinois Supreme Court basically held that our decision in Edmond governs the outcome of this case.  We do not agree. Edmond involved a checkpoint at which police stopped vehicles to look for evidence of drug crimes committed by occupants of those vehicles.  After stopping a vehicle at the checkpoint, police would examine (from outside the vehicle) the vehicle's interior; they would walk a drug-sniffing dog around the exterior; and, if they found sufficient evidence of drug (or other) crimes, they would arrest the vehicle's occupants. 531 U.S., at 35, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447.  We found that police had set up this checkpoint primarily for general "crime control" purposes, i.e., "to detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing." Id., at 41, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447.  We noted that the stop was made without individualized suspicion. And we held that the Fourth Amendment forbids such a stop, in the absence of special circumstances. Id., at 44, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447. 

The checkpoint stop here differs significantly from that inEdmond. The stop's primary law enforcement purpose was not to determine whether a vehicle's occupants were committing a crime, but to ask vehicle occupants, as members of the public, for their help in providing information about a crime in all likelihood committed by others.  The police expected the information elicited to help them apprehend, not the vehicle's occupants, but other individuals. 

Edmond's language, as well as its context, makes clear that the constitutionality of this latter, information-seeking kind of stop was not then before the Court. Edmond refers to the subject matter of its holding as "stops justified only by the generalized and ever-present possibility that interrogation and inspection may reveal that any given motorist has committed some crime." Ibid. (emphasis added).  We concede that Edmond describes the law enforcement objective there in question as a "general interest in crime control," but it specifies that the phrase "general interest in crime control" does not refer to every "law enforcement" objective.  Id., at 44, n. 1, 148 L Ed 2d 333, 121 S Ct 447.  We must read this and related general language in Edmond as we often read general language in judicial opinions--as referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before the Court and not referring to quite different circumstances that the Court was not then considering. 

 Neither do we believe, Edmond aside, that the Fourth Amendment would have us apply an Edmond-type rule of automatic unconstitutionality to brief, information-seeking highway stops of the kind now before us.  For one thing, the fact  that such stops normally lack individualized suspicion cannot by itself determine the constitutional outcome.  As in Edmond, the stop here at issue involves a motorist.  The Fourth Amendment does not treat a motorist's car as his castle.  See, e.g., New York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106, 112-113, 89 L. Ed. 2d 81, 106 S. Ct. 960 (1986); United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 561, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (1976).  And special law enforcement concerns will sometimes justify highway stops without individualized suspicion. See Michigan Dep't of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481 (1990) (sobriety checkpoint); Martinez-Fuerte, supra (Border Patrol checkpoint).  Moreover, unlikeEdmond, the context here (seeking information from the public) is one in which, by definition, the concept of individualized suspicion has little role to play.  Like certain other forms of police activity, say,  crowd control or public safety, an information-seeking stop is not the kind of event that involves suspicion, or lack of suspicion, of the relevant individual. 

For another thing, information-seeking highway stops are less likely to provoke anxiety or to prove intrusive.  The stops are likely brief.  The police are not likely to ask questions designed to elicit self-incriminating information.  And citizens will often react positively when police simply ask for their help as "responsible citizen[s]" to "give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement." Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477-478, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966). 

 Further, the law ordinarily permits police to seek the voluntary cooperation of members of the public in the investigation of a crime.  "[L]aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment by merely approaching an individual on the street or in another public place, by asking him if he is willing to answer some questions, [or] by putting questions to him if the person is willing to listen." Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497, 75 L. Ed. 2d 229, 103 S. Ct. 1319 (1983).  See also ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure § 110.1(1) (1975) ("[L]aw enforcement officer may . . . request any person to furnish information or otherwise cooperate in the investigation or prevention of crime").  That, in part, is because voluntary requests play a vital role in police investigatory work.  See, e.g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 515, 10 L. Ed. 2d 513, 83 S. Ct. 1336 (1963) ("[I]nterrogation of witnesses . . . is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement"); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement 14-15 (1999) (instructing law enforcement to gather information from witnesses near the scene). 

 The importance of soliciting the public's assistance is offset to some degree by the need to stop a motorist to obtain that help--a need less likely present where a pedestrian, not a motorist, is involved.  The difference is significant in light of our determinations that such an involuntary stop amounts to a "seizure" in Fourth Amendment terms.  E.g., Edmond, 531 U.S., at 40, 148 L Ed 2d 333, 121 S Ct 447.That difference, however, is not important enough to justify an Edmond-type rule here.  After all, as we have said, the motorist stop will likely be brief.  Any accompanying traffic delay should prove no more onerous than many that typically accompany normal  traffic congestion.  And the resulting voluntary questioning of a motorist is as likely to prove important for police investigation as is the questioning of a pedestrian. Given these considerations, it would seem anomalous were the law (1) ordinarily to allow police freely to seek the voluntary cooperation of pedestrians but (2) ordinarily to forbid police to seek similar voluntary cooperation from motorists. 

Finally, we do not believe that an Edmond-type rule is needed to prevent an unreasonable proliferation of police checkpoints. Cf. Lidster, 202 Ill. 2d, at 9-10, 779 N. E. 2d, at 859-860 (expressing that concern).  Practical considerations--namely, limited police resources and community hostility to related traffic tie-ups--seem likely to inhibit any such proliferation. See Fell, Ferguson, Williams, & Fields, Why Aren't Sobriety Checkpoints Widely Adopted as an Enforcement Strategy in the United States?  , 35 Accident Analysis & Prevention 897 (Nov. 2003) (finding that sobriety checkpoints are not more widely used due to the lack of police resources and the lack of community support).  And, of course, the Fourth Amendment's normal insistence that the stop be reasonable in context will still provide an important legal limitation on police use of this kind of information-seeking checkpoint. 

 These considerations, taken together, convince us that an Edmond-type presumptive rule of unconstitutionality does not apply here.  That does not mean the stop is automatically, or even presumptively, constitutional.  It simply means that we must judge its reasonableness, hence, its constitutionality, on the basis of the individual circumstances.  And as this Court said in Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51, 61 L. Ed. 2d 357, 99 S. Ct. 2637 (1979), in judging reasonableness, we look to "the gravity of the public concerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure advances the public interest, and the severity of the interference with individual liberty." See also Sitz, 496 U.S., at 450-455, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481 (balancing these factors in determining reasonableness of a checkpoint stop); Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S., at 556-564, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (same). 

III 

 We now consider the reasonableness of the checkpoint stop before us in light of the factors just mentioned, an issue that, in our view, has been fully argued here.  See Brief for Petitioner 14-18; Brief for Respondent 17-27.  We hold that the stop was constitutional. 

The relevant public concern was grave. Police were investigating a crime that had resulted in a human death.  No one denies the police's need to obtain more information at that time.  And the stop's objective was to help find the perpetrator of a specific and known crime, not of unknown crimes of a general sort.  Cf. Edmond, supra, at 44, 148 L. Ed. 2d 333, 121 S. Ct. 447. 

The stop advanced this grave public concern to a significant degree.  The police appropriately tailored their checkpoint stops to fit important criminal investigatory needs.  The stops took place about one week after the hit-and-run accident, on the same highway near the location of the accident, and at about the same time of night. And police used the stops to obtain information from drivers, some of whom might well  have been in the vicinity of the crime at the time it occurred.  See App. 28-29 (describing police belief that motorists routinely leaving work after night shifts at nearby industrial complexes might have seen something relevant). 

Most importantly, the stops interfered only minimally with liberty of the sort the Fourth Amendment seeks to protect.  Viewed objectively, each stop required only a brief wait in line--a very few minutes at most.  Contact with the police lasted only a few seconds.  Cf. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S., at 547, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (upholding stops of three-to-five minutes); Sitz, supra  at 448, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481 (upholding delays of 25 seconds).  Police contact consisted simply of a request for information and the distribution of a flyer. Cf. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 546, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074 (upholding inquiry as to motorists' citizenship and immigration status); Sitz, supra, at 447, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481 (upholding examination of all drivers for signs of intoxication).  Viewed subjectively, the contact provided little reason for anxiety or alarm.  The police stopped all vehicles systematically.  Cf. Martinez-Fuerte, supra, at 558, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1116, 96 S. Ct. 3074; Sitz, supra, at 452-453, 110 L. Ed. 2d 412, 110 S. Ct. 2481.  And there is no allegation here that the police acted in a discriminatory or otherwise unlawful manner while questioning motorists during stops. 

For these reasons we conclude that the checkpoint stop was constitutional. 

The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed.  


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, imposes certain duties upon incumbent local telephone companies in order to facilitate market entry by competitors, and establishes a complex regime for monitoring and enforcement.  In this case we consider whether a complaint alleging breach of the incumbent's duty under the 1996 Act to share its network with competitors states a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat 209. 

I 

 Petitioner Verizon Communications Inc. is the incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) serving New York State.  Before the 1996 Act, Verizon, 1In 1996, NYNEX was the incumbent LEC for New York State.  NYNEX subsequently merged with Bell Atlantic Corporation, and the merged entity retained the Bell Atlantic name; a further merger produced Verizon.  We use "Verizon" to refer to NYNEX and Bell Atlantic as well. like other incumbent LECs, enjoyed an exclusive franchise within its local service area.  The 1996 Act sought to "uproo[t]" the incumbent LECs' monopoly and to introduce competition in its place.  Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC,535 U.S. 467, 488, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S. Ct. 1646 (2002).  Central to the scheme of the Act is the incumbent LEC's obligation under 47 U.S.C. § 251(c) [47 USCS § 251(c)] to share its network with competitors, see AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 366, 371, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834, 119 S. Ct. 721 (1999), including provision of access to individual elements of the network on an "unbundled" basis.  § 251(c)(3).  New entrants, so-called competitive  LECs, resell these unbundled network elements (UNEs), recombined with each other or with elements belonging to the LECs. 

 Verizon, like other incumbent LECs, has taken two significant steps within the Act's framework in the direction of increased competition.  First, Verizon has signed interconnection agreements with rivals such as AT&T, as it is obliged to do under § 252, detailing the terms on which it will make its network elements available.  (Because Verizon and AT&T could not agree upon terms, the open issues were subjected to compulsory arbitration under §§ 252(b) and (c).) In 1997, the state regulator, New York's Public Service Commission (PSC), approved Verizon's interconnection agreement with AT&T. 

Second, Verizon has taken advantage of the opportunity provided by the 1996 Act for incumbent LECs to enter the long-distance market (from which they had long been excluded).  That required Verizon to satisfy, among other things, a 14-item checklist of statutory requirements, which  includes compliance with the Act's network-sharing duties. §§ 271(d)(3)(A) and (c)(2)(B).  Checklist item two, for example, includes "nondiscriminatory access to network elements in accordance with the requirements" of § 251(c)(3).  § 271(c)(2)(B)(ii).  Whereas the state regulator approves an interconnection agreement,  for long-distance approval the incumbent LEC applies to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  In December 1999, the FCC approved Verizon's § 271 application for New York. 

Part of Verizon's UNE obligation under § 251(c)(3) is the provision of access to operations support systems (OSS), a set of systems used by incumbent LECs to provide services to customers and ensure quality.  Verizon's interconnection agreement and long-distance authorization each specified the mechanics by which its OSS obligation would be met.  As relevant here, a competitive LEC sends orders for service through an electronic interface with Verizon's ordering system, and as Verizon completes certain steps in filling the order, it sends confirmation back through the same interface.  Without OSS access a rival cannot fill its customers' orders. 

In late 1999, competitive LECs complained to regulators that many orders were going unfilled, in violation of Verizon's obligation to provide access to OSS functions.  The PSC and FCC opened parallel investigations, which led to a series of orders by the PSC and a consent decree with the FCC. 2Order Directing Improvements To Wholesale Service Performance, MCI Worldcom, Inc. v Bell Atlantic-New York, Nos. 00-C-0008, 00-C-0009, 2000 WL 363378 (N.

Under the FCC consent decree, Verizon undertook  to make a "voluntary contribution"  to the U. S. Treasury in the amount of $3 million, 15 FCC Rcd. 5415, 5421, P16 (2000); under the PSC orders, Verizon incurred liability to the competitive LECs in the amount of $10  million.  Under the consent decree and orders, Verizon was subjected to new performance measurements and new reporting requirements to the FCC and PSC, with additional penalties for continued noncompliance.  In June 2000, the FCC terminated the consent decree.

The next month the PSC relieved Verizon of the heightened reporting requirement.

 Respondent Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, a New York City law firm, was a local telephone service customer of AT&T.  The day after Verizon entered its consent decree with the FCC, respondent filed a complaint in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, on behalf of itself and a class of similarly situated customers. See App. 12-33.  The complaint, as later amended, id., at 34-50, alleged that Verizon had filled rivals' orders on a discriminatory basis as part of an anticompetitive scheme to discourage customers from becoming or remaining customers of competitive LECs, thus impeding the competitive LECs' ability to enter and compete in the market for local telephone service.  See, e.g., id., at 34-35, 46-47, PP 1, 2, 52, 54.  According to the complaint, Verizon "has filled orders of [competitive LEC] customers after filling those for its own local phone service, has failed to fill in a timely manner, or not at all, a substantial number of orders for [competitive LEC] customers . . ., and has systematically failed to inform [competitive LECs] of the status of their customers' orders." Id., at 39, P 21.  The complaint set forth a single example of the alleged "failure to provide adequate access to [competitive LECs]," namely the OSS failure that resulted in the FCC consent decree and PSC orders.  Id., at 40, P 22.  It asserted that the result of Verizon's improper "behavior with respect to providing access to its local loop" was to "deter potential customers [of rivals] from switching." Id., 35, 47, PP2, 57.  The complaint sought damages and injunctive relief for violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 USC § 2 [15 USCS § 2], pursuant to the remedy provisions of §§ 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat 731, as amended, 15 USC §§ 15, 26 [15 USCS §§ 15, 26.  The complaint also alleged violations of the 1996 Act, § 202(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat 1064, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 151 et seq. [47 USCS §§ 151 et seq.], and state law. 

The District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.  As to the antitrust portion, it concluded that respondent's allegations of deficient assistance to rivals failed to satisfy the requirements of § 2.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the complaint in part, including the antitrust claim. 305 F.3d 89, 113 (2002).  We granted certiorari, limited to the question whether the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the District Court's dismissal of respondent's antitrust claims.538 U.S. 905, 538 U.S. 905, 155 L. Ed. 2d 224, 123 S. Ct. 1480 (2003). 

 II 

 To decide this case, we must first determine what effect (if any) the 1996 Act has upon the application of traditional antitrust principles.  The Act imposes a large number of duties upon incumbent LECs--above and beyond those basic responsibilities it imposes upon all carriers, such as assuring number portability and providing access to rights-of-way, see 47 U.S.C. §§ 251(b)(2), (4) [47 USCS §§ 251(b)(2), (4)].  Under the sharing duties of § 251(c), incumbent LECs are required to offer three kinds of access.  Already noted, and perhaps most intrusive, is the duty to offer access to UNEs on "just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory" terms, § 251(c)(3), a phrase that the FCC has interpreted to mean a price reflecting long-run incremental cost.  See Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC,535 U.S. 467, at 495-496, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S. Ct. 1646.  A rival can interconnect its own facilities with those of the incumbent LEC, or it can simply purchase services at wholesale from the incumbent and resell them to consumers.  See §§ 251(c)(2), (4).  The Act also imposes upon incumbents the duty to allow physical "collocation"--that is, to permit a competitor to locate and install its equipment on the incumbent's premises--which makes feasible interconnection and access to UNEs.  See § 251(c)(6). 

 That Congress created these duties, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion that they can be enforced by means of an antitrust claim. Indeed, a detailed regulatory scheme such as that created by the 1996 Act ordinarily raises the question whether the regulated entities are not shielded from antitrust scrutiny altogether by the doctrine of implied immunity. See, e.g., United States v. National Ass'n. of Sec. Dealers, Inc.,422 U.S. 694, 45 L. Ed. 2d 486, 95 S. Ct. 2427 (1975); Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc.,422 U.S. 659, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463, 95 S. Ct. 2598 (1975).  In some respects the enforcement scheme set up by the 1996 Act is a good candidate for implication of antitrust immunity, to avoid the real possibility of judgments conflicting with the agency's regulatory scheme "that might be voiced by courts exercising jurisdiction under the antitrust laws." United States v. National Ass'n. of Sec. Dealers, Inc., supra,422 U.S. 694 at 734, 45 L. Ed. 2d 486, 95 S. Ct. 2427.

Congress, however, precluded that interpretation.  Section 601(b)(1) of the 1996 Actis an antitrust-specific saving clause providing that "nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws." 110 Stat 143, 47 U.S.C. § 152, note [47 USCS § 152 note].  This bars a finding of implied immunity. As the FCC has put the point, the saving clause preserves those "claims that satisfy established antitrust standards." Brief for United States and the Federal  Communications Commission as Amici Curiae Supporting Neither Party in No. 02-7057, Covad Communications Co. v Bell Atlantic Corp. (CADC), p 8. 

 But just as the 1996 Act preserves claims that satisfy existing antitrust standards, it does not create new claims that go beyond existing antitrust standards; that would be equally inconsistent with the saving clause's mandate that nothing in the Act "modify, impair, or supersede the applicability" of the antitrust  laws. We turn, then, to whether the activity of which respondent complains violates pre-existing antitrust standards. 

III 

 The complaint alleges that Verizon denied interconnection services to rivals in order to limit entry.  If that allegation states an antitrust claim at all, it does so under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 USC § 2 [15 USCS § 2], which declares that a firm shall not "monopolize" or "attempt to monopolize." Ibid. It is settled law that this offense requires, in addition to the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, "the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident." United States v. Grinnell Corp.,384 U.S. 563, 570-571, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966).  The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system.  The opportunity to charge monopoly prices--at least for a short period--is what attracts "business acumen" in the first place; it induces risk taking that produces innovation and economic growth.  To safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.

 Firms may acquire monopoly power by establishing an infrastructure that renders them uniquely suited to serve their customers. Compelling such firms to share the source of their advantage is in some tension with the underlying purpose  of antitrust law, since it may lessen the incentive for the monopolist, the rival, or both to invest in those economically beneficial facilities.  Enforced sharing also requires antitrust courts to act as central planners, identifying the proper price, quantity, and other terms of dealing--a role for which they are illsuited.  Moreover, compelling negotiation between competitors may facilitate the supreme evil of antitrust: collusion.  Thus, as a general matter, the Sherman Act "does not restrict the long recognized right of [a] trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal." United States v. Colgate & Co.,250 U.S. 300, 307, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465, 1919 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 460 (1919). 

 However, "[t]he high value that we have placed on the right to refuse to deal with other firms does not mean that the right is unqualified." Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.,472 U.S. 585, 601, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985). Under certain circumstances, a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anticompetitive conduct and violate § 2.  We have been very cautious in recognizing such exceptions, because of the uncertain virtue of forced sharing and the difficulty of identifying and remedying anticompetitive conduct by a single firm.  The question before us today is whether the allegations of respondent's complaint fit within existing exceptions or provide a basis, under traditional antitrust principles, for recognizing a new one. 

 The leading case for § 2 liability based on refusal to cooperate with a rival, and the case upon which  respondent understandably places greatest reliance, is Aspen Skiing, supra. The Aspen ski area consisted of four mountain areas.  The defendant, who owned three of those areas, and the plaintiff, who owned the fourth, had cooperated for years in the issuance of a joint, multiple-day, all-area ski ticket. After repeatedly demanding an increased share of the proceeds, the defendant canceled the joint ticket. The plaintiff, concerned that skiers would bypass its mountain without some joint  offering, tried a variety of increasingly desperate measures to re-create the joint ticket, even to the point of in effect offering to buy the defendant's tickets at retail price. Id., 472 U.S. 585 at 593-594, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S.Ct. 2847.  The defendant refused even that.  We upheld a jury verdict for the plaintiff, reasoning that "[t]he jury may well have concluded that [the defendant] elected to forgo these short-run benefits because it was more interested in reducing competition . . . over the long run by harming its smaller competitor." Id.,472 U.S. 585 at 608, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847. 

Aspen Skiing is at or near the outer boundary of § 2 liability.  The Court there found significance in the defendant's decision to cease participation in a cooperative venture.  See id.,472 U.S. 585 at 608, 610-611, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847.  The unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealing suggested a willingness to forsake short-term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end.  Ibid. Similarly, the defendant's unwillingness to renew the ticket even if compensated at retail price revealed a distinctly anticompetitive bent. 

The refusal to deal alleged in the present case does not fit within the limited exception recognized in Aspen Skiing. The complaint does not allege that Verizon voluntarily engaged in a course of dealing with its rivals, or would ever have done so absent statutory compulsion.  Here, therefore, the defendant's prior conduct sheds no light upon the motivation of its refusal to deal--upon whether its regulatory lapses were prompted not by competitive zeal but by anticompetitive malice.  The contrast between the cases is heightened by the difference in pricing behavior.  In Aspen Skiing, the defendant turned down a proposal to sell at its own retail price, suggesting a calculation that its future monopoly retail price would be higher.  Verizon's reluctance to interconnect at the cost-based rate of compensation available under § 251(c)(3) tells us nothing about dreams of monopoly. 

 The specific nature of what the 1996 Act compels makes this case different fromAspen Skiing in a more fundamental  way.  In Aspen Skiing, what the defendant refused to provide to its competitor was a product that it already sold at retail--to oversimplify slightly, lift tickets representing a bundle of services to skiers.  Similarly, in Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States,410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973), another case relied upon by respondent,  the defendant was already in the business of providing a service to certain customers (power transmission over its network), and refused to provide the same service to certain other customers. Id., 410 U.S. 366 at 370-371, 377-378, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022.  In the present case, by contrast, the services allegedly withheld are not otherwise marketed or available to the public.  The sharing obligation imposed by the 1996 Act created "something brand new"--"the wholesale market for leasing network elements." Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC,535 U.S. 467, at 528, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S. Ct. 1646.  The unbundled elements offered pursuant to § 251(c)(3) exist only deep within the bowels of Verizon; they are brought out on compulsion of the 1996 Act and offered not to consumers but to rivals, and at considerable expense and effort.  New systems must be designed and implemented simply to make that access possible--indeed, it is the failure of one of those systems that prompted the present complaint. 3 Respondent also relies upon United States v. Terminal R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 383, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 S. Ct. 507 (1912), and Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 89 L. Ed. 2013, 65 S. Ct. 1416 (1945).  These cases involved concerted action, which presents greater anticompetitive concerns and is amenable to a remedy that does not require judicial estimation of free-market forces: simply requiring that the outsider be granted nondiscriminatory admission to the club.

 We conclude that Verizon's alleged insufficient assistance in the provision of service to rivals is not a recognized antitrust claim under this Court's existing refusal-to-deal precedents.  This conclusion would be unchanged even if we considered to be established law the "essential facilities" doctrine crafted by some lower courts, under which the Court of Appeals concluded respondent's allegations might state a claim.  See generally Areeda, Essential Facilities: An Epithet  in Need of Limiting Principles, 58 Antitrust L. J. 841 (1989).  We have never recognized such a doctrine, see Aspen Skiing Co., 472 U.S. 585 at 611, n. 44, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847; AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U.S. 366 at 428, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834, 119 S. Ct. 721 (opinion of Breyer, J.), and we find no need either to recognize it or to repudiate it here.  It suffices for present purposes to note that the indispensable requirement for invoking the doctrine is the unavailability of access to the "essential facilities"; where access exists, the doctrine serves no purpose.  Thus, it is said that "essential facility claims should . . . be denied where a state or federal agency has effective power to compel sharing and to regulate its scope and terms." P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, p 150, P 773e (2003 Supp.).  Respondent believes that the existence of sharing duties under the 1996 Act supports its case.  We think the opposite: The 1996 Act's extensive provision for access makes it unnecessary to impose a judicial doctrine of forced access.  To the extent respondent's "essential facilities" argument is distinct from its general § 2 argument, we reject it. 

IV 

 Finally, we do not believe that traditional antitrust principles justify adding the present case to the few existing exceptions from the proposition that there is no duty to aid competitors.  Antitrust analysis must always be attuned to the particular structure and circumstances of the industry at issue.  Part of that attention to economic context is an awareness of the significance of regulation.  As we have noted, "careful account must be taken of the pervasive federal and state regulation characteristic of the industry." United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank,422 U.S. 86, 91, 45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 S. Ct. 2099 (1975); see also IA P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, p 12, P 240c3 (2d ed.  2000).  "[A]ntitrust analysis must sensitively recognize and reflect the distinctive economic and legal setting of the regulated industry to which it applies." Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F.2d 17, 22 (CA1 1990) (Breyer, C. J.) (internal quotation marks omitted). 

 One factor of particular importance is the existence of a regulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm.  Where such a structure exists, the additional benefit to competition provided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small, and it will be less plausible that the antitrust laws contemplate such additional scrutiny.  Where, by contrast, "[t]here is nothing built into the regulatory scheme which performs the antitrust function," Silver v. New York Stock Exchange,373 U.S. 341, 358, 10 L. Ed. 2d 389, 83 S. Ct. 1246 (1963), the benefits of antitrust are worth its sometimes considerable disadvantages.  Just as regulatory context may in other cases serve as a basis for implied immunity, see, e.g., United States v. National Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, Inc.,422 U.S. 694 at 730-735, 45 L. Ed. 2d 486, 95 S. Ct. 2427, it may also be a consideration in deciding whether to recognize an expansion of the contours of § 2. 

 The regulatory framework that exists in this case demonstrates how, in certain circumstances, "regulation significantly diminishes the likelihood of major antitrust harm." Concord v. Boston Edison Co., supra, at 25.  Consider, for example, the statutory restrictions upon Verizon's entry into the potentially lucrative market for long-distance service.  To be allowed to enter the long-distance market in the first place, an incumbent LEC must be on good behavior in its local market.  Authorization by the FCC requires state-by-state satisfaction of § 271's competitive checklist, which as we have noted includes the nondiscriminatory provision of access to UNEs.  Section 271 applications to provide long-distance service have now been approved for incumbent LECs in 47 States and the District of Columbia.  See FCC Authorizes SBC to Provide Long Distance Service in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin (Oct. 15, 2003), http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-239978A1.pdf. 

The FCC's § 271 authorization order for Verizon to provide long-distance service in New York discussed at great length Verizon's commitments to provide access to UNEs, including  the provision of OSS.  In re Application by Bell Atlantic New York for Authorization Under Section 271 of the Communications Act To Provide In-Region, InterLATA Service in the State of New York, 15 FCC Rcd. 3953, 3989-4077, PP82-228 (1999) (Memorandum Opinion and Order) (hereinafter In re Application).  Those commitments are enforceable by the FCC through continuing oversight; a failure to meet an authorization condition can result in an order that the deficiency be corrected, in the imposition of penalties, or in the suspension or revocation of long-distance approval.  See 47 U.S.C. § 271(d)(6)(A) [47 USCS § 271(d)(6)(A)].  Verizon also subjected itself to oversight by the PSC under a so-called "Performance Assurance Plan" (PAP).  See In re New York Telephone Co., 197 P. U. R. 4th 266, 280-281 (N. Y. PSC, 1999) (Order Adopting the Amended PAP).  The PAP, which by its terms became binding upon FCC approval, provides specific financial penalties in the event of  Verizon's failure to achieve detailed performance requirements.  The FCC described Verizon's having entered into a PAP as a significant factor in its § 271 authorization, because that provided "a strong financial incentive for post-entry compliance with the section 271 checklist," and prevented "'backsliding.'" In re Application 3958-3959, PP8, 12.

The regulatory response to the OSS failure complained of in respondent's suit provides a vivid example of how the regulatory regime operates.  When several competitive LECs complained about deficiencies in Verizon's servicing of orders, the FCC and PSC responded.  The FCC soon concluded that Verizon was in breach of its sharing duties under § 251(c), imposed a substantial fine, and set up sophisticated measurements to gauge remediation, with weekly reporting requirements and specific penalties for failure.  The PSC found Verizon in violation of the PAP even earlier, and imposed additional financial penalties and measurements with daily reporting requirements.  In short, the regime was an effective steward of the antitrust function. 

 Against the slight benefits of antitrust intervention here, we must weigh a realistic assessment of its costs.  Under the best of circumstances, applying the requirements of § 2 "can be difficult" because "the means of illicit exclusion, like the means of legitimate competition, are myriad." United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 58 (CADC 2001) (en banc) (per curiam). Mistaken inferences and the resulting false condemnations "are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect." Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,475 U.S. 574, 594, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986).  The cost of false positives counsels against an undue expansion of § 2 liability.  One false-positive risk is that an incumbent LEC's failure to provide a service with sufficient alacrity might have nothing to do with exclusion.  Allegations of violations of § 251(c)(3) duties are difficult for antitrust courts to evaluate, not only because they are highly technical, but also because they are likely to be extremely numerous, given the incessant, complex, and constantly changing interaction of competitive and incumbent LECs implementing the sharing and interconnection obligations.  Amici States have filed a brief asserting that competitive LECs are threatened with "death by a thousand cuts," Brief for New York et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (internal quotation marks omitted)--the identification of which would surely be a daunting task for a generalist antitrust court.  Judicial oversight under theSherman Act would seem destined to distort investment and lead to a new layer of interminable litigation, atop the variety of litigation routes already available to and actively pursued by competitive LECs. 

 Even if the problem of false positives did not exist, conduct consisting of anticompetitive violations of § 251 may be, as we have concluded with respect to above-cost predatory pricing schemes, "beyond the practical ability of a judicial tribunal to control." Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,509 U.S. 209, 223, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993).  Effective  remediation of violations of regulatory sharing requirements will ordinarily require continuing supervision of a highly detailed decree.  We think  that Professor Areeda got it exactly right:  "No court should impose a duty to deal that it cannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise.  The problem should be deemed irremedia[ble] by antitrust law when compulsory access requires the court to assume the day-to-day controls characteristic of a regulatory agency." Areeda, 58 Antitrust L. J., at 853.  In this case, respondent has requested an equitable decree to "[p]reliminarily and permanently enjoi[n] [Verizon]  from providing access to the local loop market . . . to [rivals] on terms and conditions that are not as favorable" as those that Verizon enjoys.  App. 49-50.  An antitrust court is unlikely to be an effective day-to-day enforcer of these detailed sharing obligations. 4 The Court of Appeals also thought that respondent's complaint might state a claim under a "monopoly leveraging" theory (a theory barely discussed by respondent, see Brief for Respondent 24, n 10).  We disagree.  To the extent the Court of Appeals dispensed with a requirement that there be a "dangerous probability of success" in monopolizing a second market, it erred, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan,506 U.S. 447, 459, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993).  In any event, leveraging presupposes anticompetitive conduct, which in this case could only be the refusal-to-deal claim we have rejected.

 The 1996 Act is in an important respect much more ambitious than the antitrust laws. It attempts "to eliminate the monopolies enjoyed by the inheritors of AT&T's local franchises." Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC,535 U.S. 467, at 476, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701, 122 S. Ct. 1646 (emphasis added). Section 2 of the Sherman Act, by contrast, seeks merely to prevent unlawful monopolization.It would be a serious mistake to conflate the two goals. The Sherman Actis indeed the "Magna Carta of free enterprise," United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.,405 U.S. 596, 610, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972), but it does not give judges carte blanche to insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some  other approach might yield greater competition.  We conclude that respondent's complaint fails to state a claim under the Sherman Act. 5Our disposition makes it unnecessary to consider petitioner's alternative contention that respondent lacks antitrust standing.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 97, and n 2, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998); National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass'n of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 456, 38 L. Ed. 2d 646, 94 S. Ct. 690 (1974).

 Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 "Opportunity doesn't always knock . . . sometimes it rings." App. 113 (ETS Payphones promotional brochure).  And sometimes it hangs up.  So it did for the 10,000 people who invested a total of $300 million in the payphone sale-and-leaseback arrangements touted by respondent under that slogan.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argues that the arrangements were investment contracts, and thus were subject to regulation under the federal securities laws.  In this case, we must decide whether a moneymaking scheme is excluded from the term "investment contract" simply because the scheme offered a contractual entitlement to a fixed, rather than a variable, return.

 Respondent Charles Edwards was the chairman, chief executive officer, and sole shareholder of ETS Payphones, Inc.  (ETS). * Because the Court of Appeals ordered the complaint dismissed, we treat the case as we would an appeal from a successful motion to dismiss and accept as true the allegations in the complaint. SEC v. Zandford,535 U.S. 813, 818, 153 L. Ed. 2d 1, 122 S. Ct. 1899 (2002);Saudi Arabia v. Nelson,507 U.S. 349, 351, 354, 123 L. Ed. 2d 47, 113 S. Ct. 1471 (1993). ETS, acting partly through a subsidiary also controlled by respondent, sold payphones to the public via independent distributors.  The payphones were offered packaged with a site lease, a 5-year leaseback and management agreement, and a buyback agreement.  All but a tiny fraction of purchasers chose this package, although other management options were offered.  The purchase price for the payphone packages was approximately $7,000.  Under the leaseback and management agreement, purchasers received $82 per month, a 14% annual return.  Purchasers were not involved in the day-to-day operation of the payphones they owned.  ETS selected the site for the phone, installed the  equipment, arranged for connection and long-distance service, collected coin revenues, and maintained and repaired the phones.  Under the buyback agreement, ETS promised to refund the full purchase price of the package at the end of the lease or within 180 days of a purchaser's request. 

 In its marketing materials and on its Web site, ETS trumpeted the "incomparable pay phone" as "an exciting business opportunity," in which recent deregulation had "open[ed] the door for profits for individual pay  phone owners and operators." According to ETS, "[v]ery few business opportunities can offer the potential for ongoing revenue generation that is available in today's pay telephone industry." App. 114-115 (ETS brochure); id., at 227 (ETS Web site); see id., at 13 (Complaint PP 37-38). 

The payphones did not generate enough revenue for ETS to make the payments required by the leaseback agreements, so the company depended on funds from new investors to meet its obligations.  In September 2000, ETS filed for bankruptcy protection. The SEC brought this civil enforcement action the same month.  It alleged that respondent and ETS had violated the registration requirements of §§ 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 68 Stat 684, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(a), (c) [15 USCS §§ 77e(a), (c)], the antifraud provisions of both § 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 114 Stat 2763A-452, 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a) [15 USCS § 77q(a)], and § 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat 891, as amended 114 Stat 2763A-454, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) [15 USCS § 78j(b)], and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 CFR § 240.10b-5 (2003).  The District Court concluded that the payphone sale-and-leaseback arrangement was an investment contract within the meaning of, and therefore was subject to, the federal securities laws. SEC v. ETS Payphones, Inc.,123 F. Supp. 2d 1349 (ND Ga. 2000).  The Court of Appeals reversed. 300 F.3d 1281 (CA11 2002)(per curiam).It held that respondent's scheme was not an investment contract, on two grounds.  First, it read this Court's opinions to require that an investment contract offer either capital appreciation  or a participation in the earnings of the enterprise, and thus to exclude schemes, such as respondent's, offering a fixed rate of return. Id., at 1284-1285.  Second, it held that our opinions' requirement that the return on the investment be "derived solely from the efforts of others" was not satisfied when the purchasers had a contractual entitlement to the return. Id., at 1285.  We conclude that it erred on both grounds.

 "Congress' purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called." Reves v. Ernst & Young,494 U.S. 56, 61, 108 L. Ed. 2d 47, 110 S. Ct. 945 (1990).  To that end, it enacted a broad definition of "security," sufficient "to encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment." Ibid.Section 2(a)(1) of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(1) [15 USCS § 77b(a)(1)], and § 3(a)(10) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(10) [15 USCS § 78c(a)(10)], in slightly different formulations which we have treated as essentially identical in meaning,Reves, supra, 494 U.S. 56 at 61, n. 1, 108 L. Ed. 2d 47, 110 S. Ct. 945, define "security" to include "any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture, . . . investment contract, . . . [or any] instrument commonly known as a 'security'." "Investment contract" is not itself defined. 

 The test for whether a particular scheme is an investment contract was established in our decision inSEC v. W. J. Howey Co.,328 U.S. 293, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100 (1946).  We look to "whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others."  Id.,328 U.S. 293 at 301, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100.  This definition "embodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits." Id.,328 U.S. 293 at 299, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100. 

In reaching that result, we first observed that when Congress included "investment contract" in the definition of security, it "was using a term the meaning of which had been  crystallized" by the state courts' interpretation of their "'blue sky'" laws. Id., 328 U.S. 293 at 298, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100.  (Those laws were the precursors to federal securities regulation and were so named, it seems, because they were "aimed at promoters who 'would sell building lots in the blue sky in fee simple.'" 1 L. Loss & J. Seligman, Securities Regulation 36, 31-43 (3d ed. 1998) (quoting Mulvey, Blue Sky Law, 36 Can. L. Times 37 (1916)).) The state courts had defined an investment contract as "a contract or scheme for 'the placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment,'" and had "uniformly applied" that definition to "a variety of situations where individuals were led to invest money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would earn a profit solely through the efforts of the promoter or [a third party]." Howey, supra, 328 U.S. 293 at 298, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100 (quotingState v. Gopher Tire & Rubber Co.,146 Minn. 52, 56, 177 N. W. 937, 938 (1920)).  Thus, when we held that "profits" must "come solely from the efforts of others," we were speaking of the profits that investors seek on their investment, not the profits of the scheme in which they invest.  We used "profits" in the sense of income or return, to include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment. 

 There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns for purposes of the test, so understood.  In both cases, the investing public is attracted by representations of investment income, as purchasers were in this case by ETS' invitation to "'watch the profits add up.'" App. 13 (Complaint P 38).  Moreover, investments pitched as low-risk (such as those offering a "guaranteed" fixed return) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud, including older and less sophisticated investors. See S. Rep. No. 102-261, Vol. 2, App., p 326 (1992) (Staff Summary of Federal Trade Commission Activities Affecting Older Consumers).  Under the reading respondent advances, unscrupulous marketers of investments could evade the securities laws by picking a rate of return to promise.  We will not read into the securities laws a limitation not compelled by the language that would so undermine the laws' purposes. 

 Respondent protests that including investment schemes promising a fixed return among investment contracts conflicts with our precedent.  We disagree.  No distinction between fixed and variable returns was drawn in the blue sky law cases that the Howey Court used, in formulating the test, as its evidence of Congress' understanding of the term. Howey, supra, 328 U.S. 293 at 298, and n 4, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100.  Indeed, two of those cases involved an investment  contract in which a fixed return was promised. People v. White,124 Cal. App. 548, 550-551, 12 P.2d 1078, 1079 (1932) (agreement between defendant and investors stated that investor would give defendant $5,000, and would receive $7,500 from defendant one year later);Stevens v. Liberty Packing Corp.,111 N. J. Eq. 61, 62-63, 161 A. 193, 193-194 (1932) ("ironclad contract" offered by defendant to investors entitled investors to $56 per year for 10 years on initial investment of $175, ostensibly in sale and leaseback of breeding rabbits). 

None of our post-Howey decisions is to the contrary.  InUnited Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman,421 U.S. 837, 44 L. Ed. 2d 621, 95 S. Ct. 2051 (1975), we considered whether "shares" in a nonprofit housing cooperative were investment contracts under the securities laws.  We identified the "touchstone" of an investment contract as "the presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others," and then laid out two examples of investor interests that we had previously found to be "profits." Id.,421 U.S. 837 at 852, 44 L. Ed. 2d 621, 95 S. Ct. 2051.  Those were "capital appreciation resulting from the development of the initial investment" and "participation in earnings resulting from the use of investors' funds." Ibid. We contrasted those examples, in which "the investor is 'attracted solely by the prospects of a return'" on the investment, with  housing cooperative shares, regarding which the purchaser "is motivated by a desire to use or consume the item purchased." Id.,421 U.S. 837 at 852-853, 44 L. Ed. 2d 621, 95 S. Ct. 2051 (quotingHowey, supra, 328 U.S. 293 at 300, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100).  Thus, Forman supports the commonsense understanding of "profits" in the Howey test as simply "financial returns on . . . investments." 421 U.S. 837 at 853, 44 L. Ed. 2d 621, 95 S. Ct. 2051. 

 Concededly, Forman's illustrative description of prior decisions on "profits" appears to have been mistaken for an exclusive list in a case considering the scope of a different term in the definition of a security, "note." SeeReves, 494 U.S. 56 at 68 n. 4, 108 L. Ed. 2d 47, 110 S. Ct. 945.  But that was a misreading of Forman, and we will not bind ourselves unnecessarily to passing dictum that would frustrate Congress' intent to regulate all of the "countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits." Howey, 328 U.S., 293 at 299, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100. 

 Given that respondent's position is supported neither by the purposes of the securities laws nor by our precedents, it is no surprise that the SEC has consistently taken the opposite position, and maintained that a promise of a fixed return does not preclude a scheme from being an investment contract. It has done so in formal adjudications, e.g.,In re Abbett, Sommer & Co.,44 S. E. C. 104 (1969) (holding that mortgage notes, sold with a package of management services and a promise to repurchase the notes in the event of default, were investment contracts); see also In re Union Home Loans (Dec. 16, 1982), 26 S. E. C. Docket 1517 (report and order regarding settlement, stating that sale of promissory notes secured by deeds of trust, coupled with management services and providing investors "a  specified percentage return on their investment," were investment contracts), and in enforcement actions, e.g.,SEC v. Universal Service Asso.,106 F.2d 232, 234, 237 (CA7 1939) (accepting SEC's position that an investment scheme promising "assured profit of 30% per annum with no chance of risk or loss to the contributor" was a security because it satisfied the pertinent  substance of the Howey test, "[t]he investment of money with the expectation of profit through the efforts of other persons"); see alsoSEC v. American Trailer Rentals Co.,379 U.S. 594, 598, 13 L. Ed. 2d 510, 85 S. Ct. 513 (1965) (noting that "the SEC advised" the respondent that its "sale and lease-back arrangements," in which investors received "a set 2% of their investment per month for 10 years," "were investment contracts and therefore securities" under the 1933 Act). 

The Eleventh Circuit's perfunctory alternative holding, that respondent's scheme falls outside the definition because purchasers had a contractual entitlement to a return, is incorrect and inconsistent with our precedent.  We are considering investment contracts. The fact that investors have bargained for a return on their investment does not mean that the return is not also expected to come solely from the efforts of others.  Any other conclusion would conflict with our holding that an investment contract was offered in Howey itself. 328 U.S. 293 at 295-296, 90 L. Ed. 1244, 66 S. Ct. 1100 (service contract entitled investors to allocation of net profits). 

We hold that an investment scheme promising a fixed rate of return can be an "investment contract" and thus a "security" subject to the federal securities laws.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

 It is so ordered.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This case concerns the duration of a right to object to a pleading on the ground that it was filed out of time.  Under the Bankruptcy Rules governing Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings, a creditor has "60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors" to file a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge.  Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(a).  That period may be extended "for cause" on motion "filed before the time has expired." Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4004(b). In the matter before us a creditor, in an untimely pleading, objected to the debtor's discharge.  The debtor, however, did not promptly move to dismiss the creditor's plea as impermissibly late.  Only after the Bankruptcy Court decided, on the merits, that the discharge should be refused did the debtor, in a motion for reconsideration, urge the untimeliness of the creditor's plea. 

 Bankruptcy Rule 4004's time prescription, the debtor maintains, is "jurisdictional," i.e., dispositive whenever raised in the proceedings.  Rejecting the debtor's "jurisdictional" characterization, the courts below held that Rule 4004's time prescription could not be invoked to upset an adjudication on the merits.  We agree that Rule 4004 is not "jurisdictional." Affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, we hold that a debtor forfeits the right to rely on Rule 4004 if the debtor does not raise the Rule's time limitation before thebankruptcy court reaches the merits of the creditor's objection to discharge. 

I 

A debtor in a Chapter 7 liquidation case qualifies for an order discharging his debts if he satisfies the conditions stated in § 727(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.11 U.S.C. § 727(a) [11 USCS § 727(a)]. 1Under § 727(a), the court may not grant a discharge of any debts if the debtor, inter alia: (1) is not an individual; (2) has, with intent to defraud a creditor, concealed, transferred, or destroyed property of the estate (A) in the year preceding bankruptcy or (B) during the bankruptcy case; (3) has destroyed books or records; (4) has knowingly (A) given a false oath or account, (B) presented or used a false claim, (C) attempted to obtain money by acting or forbearing to act, or (D) withheld documents relating to the debtor's property or financial affairs; or (5) has failed to explain a loss or deficiency of assets.  11 U.S.C. §§ 727(a)(1)-(5) [11 USCS §§ 727(a)(1)-(5)]. A discharge granted under§ 727(a) frees the debtor from all debts existing at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding other than obligations § 523 of the Code excepts from discharge.  § 727(b). 2Section 523categorizes debts that are nondischargeable.  See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(1) [11 USCS § 523(a)(1)] (certain debts "for a tax or a customs duty"); § 523(a)(2)(A) (certain debts for money obtained by "false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud"); § 523(a)(5) (certain debts "to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor" for "support of such spouse or child"); § 523(a)(6) (debts for "willful and malicious injury by the debtor").

A debtor's discharge may be opposed by the trustee, the United States trustee, or any creditor.  § 727(c)(1).  Adjudication of "objections to discharg[e]," Congress provided, is a "[c]oreproceedin[g]" within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.  28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(2)(J) [28 USCS § 157(b)(2)(J)].  No statute, however, specifies a time limit for filing a complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge.  Instead, the controlling time prescriptions are contained in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, specifically, Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3). 

In relevant part, Bankruptcy Rule 4004(a) states:  "[A] complaint objecting to the debtor's discharge under § 727(a) of the Code shall be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors." Rule 4004(b), governing extensions of the Rule 4004(a) filing deadline, provides:  "[T]he court may for cause extend the time [Rule 4004(a) allows] to file a complaint objecting to discharge" if the motion is "filed before the time has expired."  Reinforcing Rule 4004(b)'s restriction on extension of the Rule 4004(a) deadline, Rule 9006(b)(3) allows enlargement of "the time for taking action" under Rule 4004(a) "only to the extent and under the conditions stated in [that rule]," i.e., only as permitted by Rule 4004(b). 3Under Bankruptcy Rule 4007(c), essentially the same time prescriptions apply to complaints targeting the discharge of a particular debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 523(c) [11 USCS § 523(c)]. Seesupra, at ____, n 2, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 874. Rule 4007(c) tracks Rules 4004(a) and (b), and Rule 9006(b)(3) lists Rule 4007(c) as well as Rule 4004(a) among time prescriptions bankruptcy courts may enlarge "only to the extent and under the conditions stated [in the rules themselves]." Because of the practical identity of the time prescriptions for objections to the discharge of any debts under § 727(a) and for objections to the discharge of particular debts under § 523(c), courts have considered decisions construing Rule 4007(c) in determining whether the time limits delineated in Rules 4004(a) and (b) may be forfeited. See, e.g., In re Kontrick, 295 F.3d 724, 730, n. 3 (CA7 2002) (citing In re Santos, 112 B. R. 1001, 1004, n. 2 (BAP CA9 1990)).

 II 

On April 4, 1997, petitioner, Dr. Andrew J. Kontrick, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. Respondent, Dr. Robert A. Ryan, a major creditor and Kontrick's former associate in  a cosmetic and plastic surgery practice, opposed Kontrick's discharge.  After gaining three successive time extensions from the Bankruptcy Court, Ryan filed an original complaint on January 13, 1998, in which he objected to the discharge of any of Kontrick's debts.  Ryan alleged that Kontrick had transferred property, within one year of filing the bankruptcy petition, with intent to defraud creditors, and therefore did not qualify for a discharge under 11 U.S.C. §§ 727(a)(2)-(5) [11 USCS §§ 727(a)(2)-(5)].  App. to Pet. for Cert. 40. 

Ryan filed an amended complaint on May 6, 1998, with leave of court, ibid., but without seeking or gaining a court-approved time extension.  The amended complaint particularized for the first time the debtor's violation of § 727(a)(2)(A) in this regard: Debtor Kontrick, creditor Ryan alleged, had fraudulently transferred money to Kontrick's wife, first by removing Kontrick's own name from the family's once-joint checking account, then by continuing regularly to deposit his salary checks into the account, from which his wife routinely  paid family expenses (the "family-account" claim).  Id., at 52-53. 4Although Kontrick took his name off the family bank account some four years prior to his bankruptcy petition, his salary check deposits continued into the one-year period preceding bankruptcy specified in 11 U.S.C. § 727(a)(2)(A) [11 USCS § 727(a)(2)(A)] (described supra, at ____, n 1, 157 L Ed 2d, at 874).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 33, 52-53.

Kontrick answered Ryan's amended complaint on June 10, 1998.  His answer "did not raise the untimeliness of [the family-account] claim," Brief for Petitioner 4; on the merits, he admitted the transfers to the family account but denied violating § 727(a)(2)(A).  In March 1999, after the parties engaged in acrimonious discovery, Ryan moved for summary judgment.  As Local Bankruptcy Rule 402(M) (Bkrtcy Ct ND Ill 1994) instructs, Ryan appended to his motion "a statement of material facts as to which [he] contend[ed] there [was] no genuine issue." Kontrick cross-moved,  in August  1999, to strike portions of Ryan's summary judgment filings. 

Kontrick's motion to strike sought deletion of "new allegations," i.e., allegations making their first appearance in the litigation in Ryan's summary judgment submissions--Ryan's statement of facts pursuant to Local Rule 402(M), accompanying exhibits, and corresponding portions of the summary judgment motion and memorandum.  Motion to Strike and Response to [Ryan's] Statement of Facts Under Local Rule 402(N) in No. 97 B 10353 (Bkrtcy Ct ND Ill), pp 2, 5, 26.  Although Kontrick noted that the family-account allegations were stated only in the amended complaint and were absent from the original complaint, id., at 3-4, he did not ask the court to strike those allegations.  His response, instead, and in line with Local Rule 402(N), addressed the substance of the family-account claim.  He admitted taking his name off the account, but observed that he did so "over four years before bankruptcy." Id., at 13.  He also acknowledged that, thereafter, he "deposited his paycheck into the account the same way he had always done." Ibid.

On February 25, 2000, the Bankruptcy Court ruled on the cross-motions,  granting in part Kontrick's motion to strike, awarding summary judgment to Ryan on the family-account claim, and dismissing the remaining claims.  The court used the amended complaint as its baseline; it struck as untimely "allegations not included in [that] complaint." App. to Pet. for Cert. 47; see id., at 48-50.  Homing in on Kontrick's continuing deposits into the account from which he had removed his name, the court concluded that Kontrick had transferred property with intent "to hinder, delay or defraud at least [creditor] Ryan." Id., at 55.  That course of conduct, coupled with Kontrick's testimony, 5In a prebankruptcy deposition, Kontrick admitted he transferred the once-joint bank account to his wife to prevent his creditors from attaching the funds.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 53; 295 F.3d 724, 727-728. the court concluded, sufficed to prove a violation of § 727(a)(2) (described supra, at ____, n 1, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 874).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 55, 64.  Accordingly, the court held, Kontrick was not entitled to a discharge of his debts. 

 Kontrick moved for reconsideration.  He argued that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction over the sole claim on which the court had  granted summary judgment, the family-account claim. Seeid., at 71.  The court was powerless to adjudicate the claim, Kontrick insisted, because the amended complaint containing the claim was untimely. Governing Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), see supra, at ____, 157 L Ed 2d, at 875, Kontrick maintained, establish a mandatory, unalterable time limit of the kind he then called "jurisdictional." App. to Pet. for Cert. 71.  It was the first time Kontrick appended a jurisdictional label to any pleading he filed relating to the family-account claim. 

The Bankruptcy Court denied the reconsideration motion on June 8, 2000, and entered final judgment five days later.  The court held that Rule 4004's complaint-filing time instructions are not "jurisdictional," and that Kontrick had waived the right to assert the untimeliness of the amended complaint by failing squarely to raise the point before the court reached the merits of Ryan's objections to discharge. 

The District Court sustained the Bankruptcy Court's decision denying Kontrick's discharge.  App. to Pet. for Cert.  25-38.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in turn, affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  In re Kontrick, 295 F.3d 724 (CA7 2002).  Both courts relied on decisions of sister Circuits holding that "the timeliness provisions at issue here are not jurisdictional." Id., at 733 (citing In re Benedict, 90 F.3d 50, 54-55 (CA2 1996), and Farouki v. Emirates Bank Int'l Ltd., 14 F.3d 244, 248 (CA4 1994)); accord App. to Pet. for Cert. 31-32.  Both courts also agreed with the Bankruptcy Court that Kontrick had waived the right to challenge Ryan's amended complaint as impermissibly late. 

The Seventh Circuit found in Kontrick's papers opposing summary judgment nothing that placed in issue the timeliness  of allegations in the amended complaint.  295 F.3d at 735.  Instead, according to the Court of Appeals, Kontrick apparently accepted creditor Ryan's amended complaint as properly filed; Kontrick used that complaint, not the original complaint, as a baseline to object to new allegations Ryan made for the first time in his statement of facts supporting summary judgment. Ibid. The Seventh Circuit further commented that "[t]he policy concerns of expeditious administration of bankruptcy matters and the finality of the bankruptcy court's decision hardly are fostered by requiring the bankruptcy court to consider the timeliness of an issue that it already has adjudicated." Ibid.

 We granted certiorari in view of the division of opinion on whether Rule 4004 is "jurisdictional," 6Compare, e.g.,Coggin v. Coggin (In re Coggin), 30 F.3d 1443, 1450-1451 (CA11 1994) (referring to Rule 4004(b) as a "jurisdictional requirement" and a "jurisdictional bar"), with, e.g., In re Benedict, 90 F.3d 50, 54 (CA2 1996) ("time period imposed by Rule 4007(c) is not jurisdictional").538 U.S. 998, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1046, 123 S. Ct. 2020 (2003), and we now affirm the judgment of the Seventh Circuit. 7 On brief and at oral argument, counsel for Kontrick suggested that, by noting that the family-account claim was not stated in the original complaint, Kontrick had implicitly invited dismissal of the claim.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; Brief for Petitioner 5 ("Kontrick . . . argued that in opposing Ryan's many other allegations as untimely, he had also sufficiently raised the untimeliness of the family account claim.").  Kontrick's notation that the family-account claim was absent from the original complaint, the courts below agreed, fell short of an argument that the claim was untimely. 295 F.3d at 735; App. to Pet. for Cert. 72.  We have no cause to disturb that determination.  In any event, we train our attention on the question Kontrick here presented: "[W]hether the deadline set by Rule 4004 is mandatory and jurisdictional and thus cannot be waived." Brief for Petitioner i.  See also Pet. for Cert. i.  We note, too, that the question whether the family-account claim could properly "relate back" to the original complaint was neither raised in the Seventh Circuit,295 F.3d at 729, n. 2, nor aired in this Court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33.

   III 

 Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction.  U.S. Const., Art. III, § 1.  Congress did so with respect to bankruptcy courts in Title 28 (Judiciary and Judicial Procedure); in cataloging core bankruptcy proceedings, Congress authorized bankruptcy courts to adjudicate, inter alia, objections to discharge.  See28 USC §§ 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(I) and (J) [28 USCS §§ 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(I) and (J).  Certain statutory provisions governing bankruptcy courts contain built-in time constraints.  For example, § 157(c)(1) addresses de novo district court review of bankruptcy court findings and conclusions in noncore proceedings; that provision confines review to "matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected." 8Provisions of a similar order, with built-in time constraints, include 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b) [28 USCS § 2401(b)] (tort claim against United States "shall be forever barred" unless presented "to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after [the] claim accrues" or civil action "is begun within six months after . . . notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented"); and § 2107(a) ("Except as otherwise provided in this section, no appeal shall bring any judgment, order or decree in an action, suit or proceeding of a civil nature before a court of appeals for review unless notice of appeal is filed, within thirty days after the entry of such judgment, order or decree."). The provision conferring jurisdiction over objections to discharge, however, contains no timeliness condition.  Section 157(b)(2)(J) instructs only that "objections to discharges" are "[c]ore proceedings" within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts. 

 The time constraints applicable to objections to discharge are contained in Bankruptcy Rules prescribed by this Court for "the practice and procedure in cases under title 11." 28 USC § 2075 [28 USCS § 2075]; cf. § 2072 (similarly providing for Court-prescribed "rules of practice and procedure" for cases in the federal district courts and courts of appeals).  "[I]t is axiomatic" that such rules "do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction." Owen Equipment & Erection Co. v. Kroger,437 U.S. 365, 370, 57 L. Ed. 2d 274, 98 S. Ct. 2396 (1978).  As Bankruptcy Rule 9030 states, the Bankruptcy Rules "shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts." Rule 9030's forerunner--its counterpart in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 82 --similarly  states: "These rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the United States district courts . . . ." See 12 C. Wright, A. Miller, & R. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3141, pp 484-485 (2d ed. 1997) ("Rule 82 states [the] important principle" that "[t]he rules merely prescribe the method by which the jurisdiction granted the courts by Congress is to be exercised."); Schacht v. United States,398 U.S. 58, 64, 26 L. Ed. 2d 44, 90 S. Ct. 1555 (1970) ("The procedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business are not jurisdictional . . . .").  In short, the  filing deadlines prescribed in Bankruptcy Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) are claim-processing rules that do not delineate what cases bankruptcy courts are competent to adjudicate. 

This much is common ground.  Kontrick does not contend in this Court that the timing rules in question affect the subject-matter jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (acknowledging that "[t]his case does not deal with subject matter jurisdiction"); id., at 9-10 (explaining that counsel for Kontrick used the word "jurisdiction" "as a shorthand" to indicate a nonextendable time limit). 

Courts, including this Court, it is true, have been less than meticulous in this regard; they have more than occasionally used the term "jurisdictional" to describe emphatic time prescriptions in rules of court.  "Jurisdiction," the Court has aptly observed, "is a word of many, too many, meanings." Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 90, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210, 118 S. Ct. 1003 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For example, we have described Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), on time enlargement, and correspondingly, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b), on extending time, as "mandatory and jurisdictional." United States v. Robinson,361 U.S. 220, 228-229, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259, 80 S. Ct. 282 (1960).  But see Carlisle v. United States,517 U.S. 416, 419-433, 134 L. Ed. 2d 613, 116 S. Ct. 1460 (1996) (holding that, over the prosecutor's objection, a court may not grant a postverdict motion for a judgment of acquittal filed one day outside the time limit allowed by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(c); this Court did not characterize  the Rule as "jurisdictional"); Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz,503 U.S. 638, 642-646, 118 L. Ed. 2d 280, 112 S. Ct. 1644 (1992) (similar ruling regarding Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b)).  "[C]lassify[ing] time prescriptions, even rigid ones, under the heading 'subject matter jurisdiction'" can be confounding.  Carlisle, 517 U.S. at 434, 134 L. Ed. 2d 613, 116 S. Ct. 1460 (Ginsburg, J., concurring).  Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label "jurisdictional" not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court's adjudicatory authority. 

 Though Kontrick concedes that Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) are not properly labeled "jurisdictional" in the sense of describing a court's subject-matter jurisdiction, he maintains that the Rules have the same import as provisions governing subject-matter jurisdiction.  A litigant generally may raise a court's lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time in the same civil action, even initially at the highest appellate instance. Mansfield, C. & L. M. R. Co. v. Swan,111 U.S. 379, 382, 28 L. Ed. 462, 4 S. Ct. 510 (1884) (challenge to a federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction may be made at any stage of the proceedings, and the court should raise the question sua sponte); Capron v. Van Noorden,6 U.S. 126, 2 Cranch 126, 127, 2 L. Ed. 229 (1804) (judgment loser successfully raised lack of diversity jurisdiction for the first time before the Supreme Court); Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3) ("Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the  court shall dismiss the action."). 9 Even subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may not be attacked collaterally.  Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co.,123 U.S. 552, 31 L. Ed. 202, 8 S. Ct. 217 (1887); see Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 12 (1982). Just so, Kontrick urges, a debtor may challenge a creditor's objection to discharge as untimely under Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3) any time in the proceedings,  even initially on appeal or certiorari.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11 (a debtor may object after final judgment or on appeal "so long as it's within the same proceeding");  Brief for Petitioner 25, and n 7 (same); Reply Brief 16, and n 7 (citing lower court decisions supporting Kontrick's argument on the longevity of time limits stated in Rules 4004 and 9006(b)(3), e.g., In re Poskanzer, 146 B. R. 125, 131 (DNJ 1992); In re Rinde, 276 B. R. 330, 333 (Bkrtcy. Ct. RI 2002); In re Barley, 130 B. R. 66, 69 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind. 1991); In re Kirsch, 65 B. R. 297, 300, 302 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ill. 1986)). 

 The equation Kontrick advances overlooks a critical difference between a rule governing subject-matter jurisdiction and an inflexible claim-processing rule.  Characteristically, a court's subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be expanded to account for the parties' litigation conduct; a claim-processing rule, on the other hand, even if unalterable on a party's application, can nonetheless be forfeited if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point. 

IV 

 We turn back now to the relevant claim-processing rules in this case.  Bankruptcy Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3), governing proceedings over which bankruptcy courts have subject-matter jurisdiction, 10Like Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 45(b) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 26(b), Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b) is modeled on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b).  See Advisory Committee's Note accompanying Rule 9006 ("Subdivision (b) is patterned after Rule 6(b) F.R.Civ.P. and Rule 26(b) F.R.App.P." (emphasis in original)). serve three primary purposes.  First, they inform the pleader, i.e., the objecting creditor, of the time he has to file a complaint.  Second, they instruct the court on the limits of its discretion to grant motions for complaint-filing-time enlargements. Third, they afford the debtor an affirmative defense to a complaint filed outside the Rules 4004(a) and (b) limits.  This case involves the third office of the Rules. 

 It is uncontested that creditor Ryan filed his complaint objecting to debtor Kontrick's discharge outside the Rules'  time limits.  Kontrick urges that nothing occurring thereafter counts, for the Rules' time prescriptions are unalterable, allowing no recourse to "equitable exceptions." Brief for Petitioner 13, n 4; see id., at 8, 16-18.  This case, however, involves no issue of equitable tolling or any other equity-based exception.  Neither at the time creditor Ryan filed the amended complaint containing the family-account claim nor anytime thereafter did he assert circumstances--equitable or otherwise--qualifying him for a time extension.  Whether the Rules, despite their strict limitations, could be softened on equitable grounds 11Lower courts have divided on the question whether Bankruptcy Rules 4004 and 4007(c) allow equitable exceptions.  Compare, e.g., 295 F.3d at 733 (Rules 4004 and 4007(c) "are subject to equitable defenses"); In re Benedict, 90 F.3d at 54 (same conclusion regarding Rule 4007(c)); Farouki v. Emirates Bank Int'l, Ltd., 14 F.3d 244, 248 (CA4 1994) (same conclusion regarding Rule 4004), with, e.g., In re Alton, 837 F.2d 457, 459 (CA11 1988) (Rule 4007(c) confers no discretion to grant an untimely motion to extend the time to object, even if the creditor lacked notice of the bar date); Neeley v. Murchison, 815 F.2d 345, 346-347 (CA5 1987) (same). is therefore  a question we do not reach. 12 Nor should anything in this opinion be read to suggest that a debtor and creditor may stipulate to the assertion of time-barred claims when such an accommodation would operate to the detriment of other creditors.  See, e.g., In re Dollar, 257 B. R. 364, 366 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SD Ga. 2001) ("Although the defendant debtor would significantly benefit by the allowance of the amended complaint [reflecting the parties' pretrial agreement to substitute an untimely § 523(a)(6) cause of action for a timely § 727(a)(2) claim,] the defendant's other creditors would be significantly harmed.").See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 ("[M]uch of [Kontrick's] argument is actually directed to an issue that is not presented in this case," i.e., whether the timing rules here in question are alterable by recourse to "'equitable exceptions imported from outside the rules.'" (quoting Brief for Petitioner 13); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 ("Whether [the bankruptcy court] would have had discretion to allow a late complaint . . . isn't before the Court, because [Ryan has not] claimed that [in this case] there is any equitable groun[d] for enlarging or extending the deadline, so that question isn't presented."). 

 We can assume, arguendo, that had Kontrick timely asserted the untimeliness of Ryan's amended complaint, Kontrick would have prevailed in the litigation.  The question, in that event, would have been "whether the time restrictions in th[e] Rules are in such 'emphatic form'" as to preclude equitable exceptions.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 (citation omitted). See, e.g., Carlisle, 517 U.S. at 419-433, 134 L. Ed. 2d 613, 116 S. Ct. 1460 (upholding timely challenge to one-day-late filing under Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(c)); Taylor, 503 U.S. at 642-646, 118 L. Ed. 2d 280, 112 S. Ct. 1644 (similar ruling regarding Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 4003(b)); Robinson,361 U.S. at 222-230, 4 L. Ed. 2d 259, 80 S. Ct. 282 (similar ruling regarding Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 45(b)).  Here, however, the sole question is whether Kontrick forfeited his right to assert the untimeliness of Ryan's amended complaint by failing to raise the issue until after that complaint was adjudicated on the merits. 13 As the Government notes, "[t]he issue in this case is more accurately described as one of forfeiture rather than waiver." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 7, n 5.  Although jurists often use the words interchangeably, "forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right[;] waiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.' United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, [123 L. Ed. 2d 508, 113 S. Ct. 1770] (1993) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, [82 L. Ed. 1461, 58 S. Ct. 1019] (1938))." Ibid. (some internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, how long did the affirmative defense Rules 4004(a) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) afforded Kontrick linger in the proceedings? 

 The Court of Appeals, we agree, followed the proper path on this key question.  See295 F.3d at 734-735.  Time bars, that court noted, generally must be raised in an answer or responsive pleading. SeeFed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (made applicable to adversary proceedings in  bankruptcy courts by Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7008(a)). 14In fuller detail, Bankruptcy Rule 4004(d) provides that "[a] proceeding commenced by a complaint objecting to discharge is governed by Part VII of these rules." Part VII includes Bankruptcy Rule 7008(a), which states that "Rule 8 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings." An answer may be amended to include an inadvertently omitted affirmative defense, and even after the time to amend "of course" has passed, "leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires." Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(a); see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7015 ("Rule 15 F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings."). 

Kontrick not only failed to assert the time constraints of Rules 4004(a)) and (b) and 9006(b)(3) in a pleading or amended pleading responsive to Ryan's amended complaint.  As earlier recounted, see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L Ed 2d, at 875-876, Kontrick moved to delete certain items from Ryan's summary judgment filings, but, even that far into the litigation, he did not ask the Bankruptcy Court to strike the family-account claim. 

Ordinarily, under the Bankruptcy Rules as under the Civil Rules, a defense is lost if it is not included in the answer or amended answer.  SeeFed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 7012(b) ("Rule 12(b)-(h) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings."); 5A C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1347, p 184 (2d ed. 1990)  ("A defense or objection that is not raised by motion or in the responsive pleading is waived unless it is protected by Rules 12(h)(2) or 12(h)(3) or by the successful invocation of the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15."). Rules 12(h)(2) and (3) prolong the life of certain defenses, but time prescriptions are not among those provisions.  Even if a defense based on Bankruptcy Rule 4004 could be equated to "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted," the issue could be raised, at the latest, "at the trial on the merits.  " Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(2).  Only lack of subject-matter jurisdiction is preserved post-trial.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12(h)(3).  And, as we earlier explained, see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L Ed 2d, at 878-879, Kontrick's resistance to the  family-account claim is not of that order.  No reasonable construction of complaint-processing rules, in sum, would allow a litigant situated as Kontrick is to defeat a claim, as filed too late, after the party has litigated and lost the case on the merits. * * * 

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is affirmed.  


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 In this case we consider whether the Eleventh Amendment bars enforcement of a federal consent decree entered into by state officials. 

I 

Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state program that provides federal funding for state medical services to the poor.  See Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Ass'n.,496 U.S. 498, 502, 110 L. Ed. 2d  455, 110 S. Ct. 2510 (1990).  State participation is voluntary; but once a State elects to join the program, it must administer a state plan that meets federal requirements.  One requirement is that every participating State must have an Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) program.  See 79 Stat 343, as amended, 42 USC §§ 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r) [42 USCS §§ 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r)].  EPSDT programs provide health care services to  children to reduce lifelong vulnerability to illness or disease.  The EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid statute require participating States to provide various medical services to eligible children, and to provide notice of the services.  See ibid.

Petitioners here are mothers of children eligible for EPSDT services in Texas.  In 1993 they filed a civil action pursuant to Rev Stat § 1979, 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983], seeking injunctive relief against the Texas Department of Health and the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, as well as various officials at these agencies charged with implementing the Texas EPSDT program.  The named officials included the Commissioners of the two agencies, the Texas State Medicaid Director, and certain employees at the Texas Department of Health.  The individuals were sued in their official capacities and were represented throughout the litigation by the office of the Texas attorney general. 

 Petitioners alleged that the Texas program did not satisfy the requirements of federal law. They asserted that the Texas program did not ensure eligible children would receive health, dental, vision, and hearing screens; failed to meet annual participation goals; and gave eligible recipients inadequate notice of available services.  Petitioners also claimed the program lacked proper case management and corrective procedures and did not provide uniform services throughout Texas. 

After the suit was filed, the two Texas state agencies named in the suit moved to dismiss the claims against them on Eleventh Amendment grounds.  Petitioners did not object, and in 1994 the District Court dismissed the state agencies as parties.  The state officials remained in the suit, and the District Court certified a class consisting of children in Texas entitled to EPSDT services, a class of more than 1 million persons.  Following extensive settlement negotiations, petitioners and the state officials agreed to resolve the suit by entering into a consent decree. The District  Court conducted a fairness hearing, approved the consent decree, and entered it in 1996. 

Judicial enforcement of the 1996 consent decree is the subject of the present dispute.  The decree is a detailed document about 80 pages long that orders a comprehensive plan for implementing the federal statute. In contrast with the brief and general mandate in the statute itself, the consent decree requires the state officials to implement many specific procedures.  An example illustrates the nature of the difference.  The EPSDT statute requires States to "provid[e] or arrang[e] for the provision of . . . screening services in all cases where they are requested," and also to arrange for "corrective treatment" in such cases.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43)(B), (C) [42 USCS §§ 1396a(a)(43)(B), (C)].  The consent  decree implements the provision in part by directing the Texas Department of Health to staff and maintain toll-free telephone numbers for eligible recipients who seek assistance in scheduling and arranging appointments.  Consent Decree PP 241-242, Lodging of Petitioners 63-64.  According to the decree, the advisors at the toll-free numbers must furnish the name, address, and telephone numbers of one or more health care providers in the appropriate specialty in a convenient location, and they also must assist with transportation arrangements to and from appointments.  Id., PP 243-245, Lodging of Petitioners 64.  The advisers must inform recipients enrolled in managed care health plans that they are free to choose a primary care physician upon enrollment.  Id., P 244, Lodging of Petitioners 64. 

Two years after the consent decree was entered, petitioners filed a motion to enforce it in the District Court.  The state officials, it was alleged, had not complied with the decree in various respects.  The officials denied the allegations and maintained that the Eleventh Amendment rendered the decree unenforceable even if they were in noncompliance.  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court issued a detailed opinion concluding that certain provisions  of the consent decree had been violated.  Frew v. Gilbert, 109 F. Supp. 2d 579 (ED Tex. 2000).  The District Court rejected the Eleventh Amendment argument, id., at 660-678, and directed the parties to submit proposals outlining possible remedies for the violations. 

The state officials filed an interlocutory appeal, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals held that the Eleventh Amendment prevented enforcement of the decree unless the violation of the consent decree was also a statutory violation of the Medicaid Act that imposed a clear and binding obligation on the State.  Frazar v. Gilbert, 300 F.3d 530, 543 (CA5 2002).  The Court of Appeals assessed the violations identified by the District Court and concluded that none provided a valid basis for enforcement.  Regardless of whether the EPSDT program complied with the detailed consent decree, the Court of Appeals reasoned, the program was good enough to comply with the general mandates of federal law. The Court of Appeals concluded that because petitioners had not established a violation of federal law, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to remedy the consent decree violations.  Id., at 546-551. 

Other Circuits have reached a contrary result, holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar enforcement of consent decrees in like circumstances.  See, e.g., Kozlowski v. Coughlin, 871 F.2d 241, 244 (CA2 1989); Wisconsin Hospital Assn. v. Reivitz, 820 F.2d 863, 868 (CA7 1987).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals.538 U.S. 905, 123 S. Ct. 1481; 155 L. Ed. 2d 223 (2003). 

II 

 Petitioners advance two reasons why the consent decree can be enforced without violating the Eleventh Amendment.  First, they argue the State waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity in the course of litigation.  Second, they contend that enforcement is permitted under the principles of Ex parte Young,209 U.S. 123, 52 L. Ed. 714, 28 S. Ct. 441 (1908).  We agree that  the decree is  enforceable under Ex parte Young, and so we do not address the waiver argument. 

 This case involves the intersection of two areas of federal law: the reach of the Eleventh Amendment and the rules governing consent decrees.  The Eleventh Amendment confirms the sovereign status of the States by shielding them from suits by individuals absent their consent. Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,517 U.S. 44, 54, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996).  To ensure the enforcement of federal law, however, the Eleventh Amendment permits suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials acting in violation of federal law. Ex parte Young, supra.This standard allows courts to order prospective relief, see Edelman v. Jordan,415 U.S. 651, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662, 94 S. Ct. 1347 (1974); Milliken v. Bradley,433 U.S. 267, 53 L. Ed. 2d 745, 97 S. Ct. 2749 (1977), as well as measures ancillary to appropriate prospective relief, Green v. Mansour,474 U.S. 64, 71-73, 88 L. Ed. 2d 371, 106 S. Ct. 423 (1985).  Federal courts may not award retrospective relief, for instance money damages or its equivalent, if the State invokes its immunity. Edelman, supra, 415 U.S. 651 at 668, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662, 94 S. Ct. 1347. 

 Consent decrees have elements of both contracts and judicial decrees. Firefighters v. Cleveland,478 U.S. 501, 519, 92 L. Ed. 2d 405, 106 S. Ct. 3063 (1986).A consent decree "embodies an agreement of the parties" and is also "an agreement that the parties desire and expect will be reflected in, and be enforceable as, a judicial decree that is subject to the rules generally applicable to other judgments and decrees." Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,502 U.S. 367, 378, 116 L. Ed. 2d 867, 112 S. Ct. 748 (1992).  Consent decrees entered in federal court must be directed to protecting federal interests.  In Firefighters, we observed that a federal consent decree must spring from, and serve to resolve, a dispute within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction; must come within the general scope of the case made by the pleadings; and must further the objectives of the law upon which the complaint was based.  478 U.S., 501 at 525, 92 L. Ed. 2d 405, 106 S. Ct. 3063. 

 This brings us to the intersection of the principles governing consent decrees and the Eleventh Amendment. As we  understand their argument, the state officials do not contend that the terms of the decree were impermissible under Ex parte Young. Nor do they contend that the consent decree failed to comply with Firefighters. The officials challenge only the enforcement of the decree, not its entry.  They argue that the Eleventh Amendment narrows the circumstances in which courts can enforce federal consent decrees involving state officials. 

The theory advanced by the state officials is similar to the one accepted by the Court of Appeals.  The officials reason that Ex parte Young creates a narrow exception to the general rule of Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit.  Consent decrees involving state representatives threaten to broaden this exception, they contend, because decrees allow state officials to bind state governments to significantly more commitments than what federal law requires.  Brief for Respondents 9-22.  Permitting the enforcement of a broad consent decree would give courts jurisdiction over not just federal law, but also everything else that officials agreed to when they entered into the consent  decree. A State in full compliance with federal law could remain subject to federal court oversight through a course of judicial proceedings brought to enforce the consent decree. To avoid circumventing Eleventh Amendment protections, the officials argue, a federal court should not enforce a consent decree arising from an Ex parte Young suit unless the court first identifies,  at the enforcement stage, a violation of federal law such as the EPSDT statute itself.  Brief for Respondents 9-22. 

 We disagree with this view of the Eleventh Amendment. The decree is a federal court order that springs from a federal dispute and furthers the objectives of federal law. See Firefighters, supra, 478 U.S. 501 at 525, 519, 92 L. Ed. 2d 405, 106 S. Ct. 3063.  The decree states that it creates "a mandatory, enforceable obligation." Consent Decree P 302, Lodging of Petitioners 76.  In light of the State's assertion of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the state  officials lacked the authority to agree to remedies beyond the scope of Ex parte Young absent a waiver, as petitioners concede.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 12.  We can assume, moreover, that the state officials could not enter into a consent decree failing to satisfy the general requirements of consent decrees outlined in Firefighters. Petitioners' motion to enforce, however, sought enforcement of a remedy consistent with Ex parte Young and Firefighters, a remedy the state officials themselves had accepted when they asked the District Court to approve the decree. Enforcing the agreement does not violate the Eleventh Amendment.

 The theory advanced by the state officials relies heavily on our decision in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman,465 U.S. 89, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984).  Pennhurst is distinguishable.  In that case we found the rationale of Ex parte Young inapplicable to suits brought against state officials alleging violations of state law.  Id.,465 U.S. 89 at 106, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67, 104 S. Ct. 900.  Jurisdiction was improper because "[a] federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law." Ibid. Here, by contrast, the order to be enforced is a federal decree entered to implement a federal statute. The decree does implement the Medicaid statute in a highly detailed way, requiring the state officials to take some steps that the statute does not specifically require.  The same could be said, however, of any effort to implement the general EPSDT statute in a particular way.  The decree reflects a choice among various ways that a State could implement the Medicaid Act. As a result, enforcing the decree vindicates an agreement that the state officials reached to comply with federal law. 

Hutto v. Finney, 437 U.S. 678, 57 L. Ed. 2d 522, 98 S. Ct. 2565 (1978), is instructive on this point.  In Finney, the Court upheld a District Court's award of attorney's fees designed to encourage state compliance with an existing court order.  State prisoners had sued state prison officials claiming that the conditions of their confinement  violated the Eighth Amendment, and the District Court had ordered the officials to improve prison conditions.  When the officials refused to comply in good faith with the order, the District Court awarded attorney's fees to the prisoners' lawyers to be paid from the state treasury.  Id., 467 U.S. 678 at 685, 57 L. Ed. 2d 522, 98  S. Ct. 2565.  The state officials objected, arguing that the relief was not valid under the Eleventh Amendment because it exceeded the scope of Ex parte Young. The Court rejected this argument: "In exercising their prospective powers under Ex parte Young and Edelman v Jordan, federal courts are not reduced to issuing injunctions against state officers and hoping for compliance.  Once issued, an injunction may be enforced.  . . .  If a state agency refuses to adhere to a court order, a financial penalty may be the most effective means of insuring compliance.  The principles of federalism that inform Eleventh Amendment doctrine surely do not require federal courts to enforce their decrees only by sending high state officials to jail.  The less intrusive power to impose a fine is properly treated as ancillary to the federal court's power to impose injunctive relief." 437 U.S., 678 at 690-691, 57 L. Ed. 2d 522, 98 S. Ct. 2565.

The award of attorney's fees "vindicated the District Court's authority over a recalcitrant litigant," the Court continued.  "We see no reason to distinguish this award from any other penalty imposed to enforce a prospective injunction." Id.,437 U.S., 678 at 691-692, 57 L. Ed. 2d 522, 98 S. Ct. 2565. 

 WhileFinney is somewhat different from the present case in that it involved the scope of remedies for violation of a prior order rather than the antecedent question whether remedies are permitted in the first instance, a similar principle applies.  Federal courts are not reduced to approving consent decrees and hoping for compliance.  Once entered, a consent decree may be enforced. 

 III 

 The state officials warn that enforcement of consent decrees can undermine the sovereign interests and accountability of state governments.  Brief for Respondents 23-32.  The attorneys general of 19 States assert similar arguments as amici curiae. Brief for Utah et al. as Amici Curiae. The concerns they express are legitimate ones.  If not limited to reasonable and necessary implementations of federal law, remedies outlined in consent decrees involving state officeholders may improperly deprive future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.  They may also lead to federal-court oversight of state programs for long periods of time even absent an ongoing violation of federal law. 

When a federal court has entered a consent decree under Ex parte Young, the law's primary response to these concerns has its source not in the Eleventh Amendment but in the court's equitable powers and the direction given by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  In particular, Rule 60(b)(5) allows a party to move for relief if "it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application." The Rule encompasses the traditional power of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances.  In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,502 U.S. 367, 116 L. Ed. 2d 867, 112 S. Ct. 748 (1992), the Court explored the application of the Rule to consent decrees involving institutional reform.  The Court noted that district courts should apply a "flexible standard" to the modification of consent decrees when a significant change in facts or law warrants their amendment.  Id.,502 U.S. 367 at 393, 116 L. Ed. 2d 867, 112 S. Ct. 748.  See also Philadelphia  Welfare Rights Org. v. Shapp, 602 F.2d 1114 (CA3 1979) (modifying consent decree implementing Pennsylvania's EPSDT program in light of changed circumstances). 

Rufo rejected the idea that the institutional concerns of government officials were "only marginally relevant" when officials moved to amend a consent decree, and noted that  "principles of federalism and simple common sense require the [district] court to give significant weight" to the views of government officials.  502 U.S. 367 at 392, n. 14, 116 L. Ed. 2d 867, 112 S. Ct. 748.  When a suit under Ex parte Young requires a detailed order to ensure compliance with a decree for prospective relief, and the decree in effect mandates the State, through its named officials, to administer a significant federal program, principles of federalism require that state officials with front-line responsibility for administering the program be given latitude and substantial discretion. 

 The federal court must exercise its equitable powers to ensure that when the objects of the decree have been attained, responsibility for discharging the State's obligations is returned promptly to the State and its officials.  As public servants, the officials of the State must be presumed to have a high degree of competence in deciding how best to discharge their governmental responsibilities.  A State, in the ordinary course, depends upon successor officials, both appointed and elected, to bring new insights and solutions to problems of allocating revenues and resources.  The basic obligations of federal law may remain the same, but the precise manner of their discharge may not.  If the State establishes reason to modify the decree, the court should make the necessary changes; where it has not done so, however, the decree should be enforced according to its terms. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This case concerns the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency)  to enforce the provisions of the Clean Air Act's (CAA or Act) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program.  Under that program, no major air pollutant emitting facility may be constructed unless the facility is  equipped with "the best available control technology" (BACT).  As added by § 165, 91 Stat 735, and amended, 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(4) [42 USCS § 7475(a)(4)].  BACT, as defined in the CAA, means, for any major air pollutant emitting facility, "an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction . . . which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [the] facility. . . ." § 7479(3). 

Regarding EPA oversight, the Act includes a general instruction and one geared specifically to the PSD program.  The general prescription, § 113(a)(5) of the Act, authorizes EPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAA requirement governing construction of a pollutant source, to issue an order prohibiting construction, to prescribe an administrative penalty, or to commence a civil action for injunctive relief.  42 U.S.C. § 7413(a) [42 USCS § 7413(a)].  Directed specifically to the PSD program, CAA § 167 instructs EPA to "take such measures, including issuance of an order, or seeking injunctive relief, as necessary to prevent the construction" of a major pollutant emitting facility that does not conform to the PSD requirements of the Act.  42 USC § 7477 [42 USCS § 7477]. 

 In the case before us, "the permitting authority" under § 7479(3) is the State of Alaska, acting through Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC).  The question presented is what role EPA has with respect to ADEC's BACT determinations.  Specifically, may EPA act to block construction of a new major pollutant emitting facility permitted by ADEC when EPA finds ADEC's BACT determination unreasonable in light of the guides § 7479(3) prescribes?  We hold that the Act confers that checking authority on EPA.

A 

Congress enacted the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat 1676, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq. [42 USCS §§ 7401 et seq.], in response to "dissatisfaction with the progress of existing air pollution programs." Union Elec. Co. v. EPA,427 U.S. 246, 249, 49 L. Ed. 2d 474, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (1976).  The amendments aimed "to guarantee the prompt attainment and maintenance of specified air quality standards." Ibid.; D. Currie, Air Pollution § 1.13, p 1-16 (1981) (summary of 1970 amendments).  Added by the 1970 amendments, §§ 108(a) and 109(a) of the Act require EPA to publish lists of emissions that "cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare," and to promulgate primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for such pollutants. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7408(a) and 7409(a) [42 USCS §§ 7408(a) and 7409(a)]; Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 462-463, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1, 121 S. Ct. 903 (2001).  NAAQS "define [the] levels of air quality that must be achieved to protect public health and welfare." R. Belden, Clean Air Act 6 (2001).  The Agency published initial NAAQS in 1971, Union Elec.,427 U.S. 246, at 251, 49 L. Ed. 2d 474, 96 S. Ct. 2518 (citing 40 CFR pt. 50 (1975)),  and in 1985, NAAQS for the  pollutant at issue in this case, nitrogen dioxide.  40 CFR § 50.11 (2002). 1Emissions levels for nitrogen dioxide, a regulated pollutant under the Act, are defined in terms of quantities of all oxides of nitrogen. R. Belden, Clean Air Act 47, n 11 (2001).  "The term nitrogen oxides refers to a family of compounds of nitrogen and oxygen.  The principal nitrogen oxides component present in the atmosphere at any time is nitrogen dioxides.  Combustion sources emit mostly nitric oxide, with some nitrogen dioxide.  Upon entering the atmosphere, the nitric oxide changes rapidly, mostly to nitrogen dioxide." EPA, Prevention of Significant Deterioration for Nitrogen Oxides,53 Fed. Reg. 40656 (1988).  Nitrogen oxides are also termed "NOx."

 Under § 110 of the Act, also added in 1970, each State must submit for EPA approval "a plan which provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of [NAAQS]." 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(1) [42 USCS § 7410(a)(1)]; cf. § 7410(c)(1) (EPA shall promulgate an implementation plan if the State's plan is inadequate).  Relevant to this case, EPA has approved Alaska's implementation plan.  48 Fed. Reg. 30626 (1983), as amended, 56 Fed. Reg. 19288 (1991); 40 CFR § 52.96(a) (2002).  To gain EPA approval, a "state implementation plan" (SIP) must "include enforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable [CAA] requirements." 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(A) [42 USCS § 7410(a)(2)(A)].  While States have "wide discretion" in formulating their plans, Union Elec., 427 U.S. 246, at 250, 49 L. Ed. 2d 474, 96 S. Ct. 2518, SIPs must include certain measures Congress specified "to assure that national ambient air quality standards are achieved," 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(C) [42 USCS § 7410(a)(2)(C)].  Among those measures are permit provisions, § 7475, basic to the administration of the program involved in this case, CAA's "Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality" (PSD) program. 

The PSD requirements, enacted as part of 1977 amendments to the Act, Title I, § 160 et seq., 91 Stat 731, "are designed to ensure that the air quality in attainment areas or areas that are already 'clean' will not degrade," Belden, supra, at 43.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7470(1) [42 USCS § 7470(1)] (purpose of PSD program  is to "protect public health and welfare from any actual or potential adverse effect which in [EPA's] judgment may reasonably be anticipate[d] to occur from air pollution . . . notwithstanding attainment and maintenance of all national ambient air quality standards").  Before 1977, no CAA provision specifically addressed potential air quality deterioration in areas where pollutant levels were lower than the NAAQS. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 204 U.S. App. D.C. 51, 636 F.2d 323, 346-347 (CADC 1979).  Responding to litigation initiated by an environmental group, 2Sierra Club v. Ruckelshaus, 344 F. Supp. 253 (DC 1972), aff'd per curiam, 4 E. R. C. 1815, 2 Env. L. Rep. 20656 (CADC 1972), aff'd by an equally divided court sub nom. Fri v. Sierra Club, 412 U.S. 541, 37 L. Ed. 2d 140, 93 S. Ct. 2770 (1973). however, EPA issued regulations in 1974 requiring that SIPs include a PSD program. Id., at 347, and n 18 (citing 39 Fed. Reg. 42510 (1974)).  Three years later, Congress adopted the current PSD program.  See S. Rep. No. 95-127, p 11 (1977) (Congress itself has "a responsibility to delineate a policy for protecting clean air"). 

The PSD program imposes on States a regime governing areas  "designated pursuant to [42 USC § 7407 [42 U.S.C. § 7407] as attainment or unclassifiable." § 7471. 3The PSD program also requires visibility control measures, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7491-7492 [42 USCS §§ 7491-7492], not at issue in this case. An attainment area is one in which the air "meets the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard for [a regulated pollutant]." § 7407(d)(1)(A)(ii).  Air in an unclassifiable area "cannot be classified on the basis of available information as meeting or not meeting the national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard for the pollutant." § 7407(d)(1)(A)(iii).  Northwest Alaska, the region this case concerns, is classified as an attainment or unclassifiable area for nitrogen dioxide, 40 CFR § 51.302 (2002); therefore, the PSD program applies to emissions of that pollutant in the region. In 2002, the Agency reported that "[a]ll areas of the country that once  violated the NAAQS for [nitrogen dioxide] now meet that standard." EPA, Latest Findings on National Air Quality 7 (Aug. 2003). 

Section 165 of the Act, 42 USC § 7475 [42 USCS § 7475], installs a permitting requirement for any "major emitting facility," defined to include any source emitting more than 250 tons of nitrogen oxides per year, § 7479(1).  No such facility may be constructed or modified unless a permit prescribing emission limitations has been issued for the facility.  § 7475(a)(1); see § 7479(2)(C) (defining "construction" to include "modification").  Alaska's SIP imposes an analogous requirement.  18 Alaska Admin.  Code § 50.300(c)(1) (2003).  Modifications to major emitting facilities that increase nitrogen oxide emissions in excess of 40 tons per year require a PSD permit.  40 CFR § 51.166(b)(23)(i) (2002); 18 Alaska Admin. Code § 50.300(h)(3)(B)(ii) (2003). 

The Act sets out preconditions for the issuance of PSD permits.  Inter alia, no PSD permit may issue unless "the proposed facility is subject to the best available control technology for each pollutant subject to [CAA] regulation . . . emitted from . . . [the] facility." 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(4) [42 USCS § 7475(a)(4)].  As described in the Act's definitional provisions, "best available control technology" (BACT) means: "[A]n emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from or which results from any major emitting facility, which the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such facility through application of production processes and available methods, systems, and techniques . . . .  In no event shall application of 'best available control technology' result in emissions of any pollutants which will exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard established pursuant  to section 7411 or 7412 of this title [emission standards for new and existing stationary sources]." § 7479(3).

40 CFR § 51.166(b)(12) (2002) (repeating statutory definition).  Alaska's SIP contains provisions that track the statutory BACT requirement and definition.  18 Alaska Admin. Code §§ 50.310(d)(3) and 50.990(13) (2003).  The State, with  slightly variant terminology, defines BACT as "the emission limitation that represents the maximum reduction achievable for each regulated air contaminant, taking into account energy, environmental and economic impacts, and other costs." §50.990(13).  Under the federal Act, a limited class of sources must gain advance EPA approval for the BACT prescribed in the permit.  42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(8) [42 USCS § 7475(a)(8)]. 

CAA also provides that a PSD permit may issue only if a source "will not cause, or contribute to, air pollution in excess of any . . . maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration for any pollutant" or any NAAQS.  § 7475(a)(3).  Congress left to the Agency the determination of most maximum allowable increases, or "increments," in pollutants. EPA regulations have defined increments for nitrogen oxides.  40 CFR § 51.166(c) (2002).  Typically, to demonstrate that increments will not be exceeded, applicants use mathematical models of pollutant plumes, their behavior, and their dispersion.  Westbrook, Air Dispersion Models: Tools to Assess Impacts from Pollution Sources, 13 Natural Resources & Env. 546, 547-548 (1999). 

Among measures EPA may take to ensure compliance with the PSD program, two have special relevance here.  The first prescription, § 113(a)(5) of the Act, provides that "[w]henever, on the basis of any available information, [EPA] finds that a State is not acting in compliance with any requirement or prohibition of the chapter relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources," EPA may "issue an order prohibiting the construction or modification of any major stationary source in any area to which such requirement applies." 42 U.S.C. § 7413(a)(5)(A) [42 USCS § 7413(a)(5)(A)]. 4As enacted in 1977, § 113(a)(5) extended only to solid waste combustion and sources in nonattainment areas.  See Title I, § 111(a), 91 Stat 685.  Congress extended § 113(a)(5) in 1990 amendments to the Act to cover attainment areas, and thus to encompass enforcement of PSD permitting requirements.  Title VII, 104 Stat 2672. The second measure, § 167 of the Act, trains on enforcement of the PSD program; it requires EPA to "take such measures, including issuance of an order, or seeking injunctive relief, as necessary to prevent the construction or modification of a major emitting facility which does not conform to the [PSD] requirements." § 7477.

Teck Cominco Alaska Inc. (Cominco), operates a zinc concentrate mine, the Red Dog Mine, in northwest Alaska approximately 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle and close to the native Alaskan villages of Kivalina and Noatak.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a; Brief for Petitioner 8; Brief for Respondents 4.  The mine is the region's largest private employer.  Brief for Petitioner 9.  It supplies a quarter of the area's wage base.  Ibid. Cominco leases the land from the NANA Regional Corporation, an Alaskan corporation formed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat 688, as amended, 43 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq. [43 USCS §§ 1601 et seq.] Brief for NANA Regional Corporation, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 1-2, 4. 

In 1988, Cominco obtained authorization to operate the mine, a "major emitting facility" under the Act and Alaska's SIP.  App. 106.  The  mine's PSD permit authorized five 5,000 kilowatt Wartsila diesel electric generators, MG-1 through MG-5, subject to operating restrictions; two of the five generators were permitted to operate only in standby status.  Ibid. Petitioner Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) issued a second PSD permit in 1994 allowing addition of a sixth full-time generator (MG-6), removing standby status from MG-2, and imposing a new  operational cap that allowed all but one generator to run full time.  Ibid.

In 1996, Cominco initiated a project, with funding from the State, to expand zinc production by 40%.  Brief for Petitioner 5; Reply Brief for Petitioner 11, n 9.  Anticipating that the project would increase nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 40 tons per year, see supra, at ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 986, 124 S. Ct. 983,  Cominco applied to ADEC for a PSD permit to allow, inter alia, increased electricity generation by its standby generator, MG-5.  App. 107-108; App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a.  On March 3, 1999, ADEC preliminarily proposed as BACT for MG-5 the emission control technology known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), 5SCR requires injections of "ammonia or urea into the exhaust before the exhaust enters a catalyst bed made with vanadium, titanium, or platinum.  The reduction reaction occurs when the flue gas passes over the catalyst bed where the NOx and ammonia combine to become nitrogen, oxygen, and water . . . ." App. 71. which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 90%.  App. 72, 108.  In response, Cominco amended its application to add a seventh generator, MG-17, and to propose as BACT an alternative control technology--Low NOx 6In Low NOx, changes are made to a generator to improve fuel atomization and modify the combustion space to enhance the mixing of air and fuel.  Id., at 75.--that achieves a 30% reduction in nitrogen oxide pollutants. Brief for Respondents 5, and n 1; App. 84. 

 On May 4, 1999, ADEC, in conjunction with Cominco's representative, issued a first draft PSD permit and preliminary technical analysis report that concluded Low NOx was BACT for MG-5 and MG-17.  Id., at 55-95.  To determine BACT, ADEC employed EPA's recommended top-down methodology, id., at 61: "In brief, the top-down process provides that all available control technologies be ranked in descending order of control effectiveness.  The PSD applicant first examines the most stringent--or 'top'--alternative.  That alternative  is established as BACT unless the applicant demonstrates, and the permitting authority in its informed judgment agrees,  that technical considerations, or energy, environmental, or economic impacts justify a conclusion that the most stringent technology is not 'achievable' in that case.  If the most stringent technology is eliminated in this fashion, then the next most stringent alternative is considered, and so on." EPA, New Source Review Workshop Manual B2 (Draft Oct. 1990) (hereinafter New Source Review Manual); App. 61-62. 7 Nothing in the Act or its implementing regulations mandates top-down analysis.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3) [42 USCS § 7479(3)]; 40 CFR § 52.21(j) (2002).  EPA represents that permitting authorities "commonly" use top-down methodology.  Brief for Respondents 3.

 Applying top-down methodology, ADEC first homed in on SCR as BACT for MG-5, and the new generator,  MG-17.  "[W]ith an estimated reduction of 90%," ADEC stated, SCR "is the most stringent" technology. Id., at 79.  Finding SCR "technically and economically feasible," id., at 65, ADEC characterized as "overstated" Cominco's cost estimate of $5,643 per ton of nitrogen oxide removed by SCR, id., at 113.  Using Cominco's data, ADEC reached a cost estimate running between $1,586 and $2,279 per ton.  Id., at 83.  Costs in that range, ADEC observed, "are well within what ADEC and EPA conside[r] economically feasible." Id., at 84.  Responding to Cominco's comments on the preliminary permit, engineering staff in ADEC's Air Permits Program pointed out that, according to information Cominco provided to ADEC, "SCR has been installed on similar diesel-fired engines throughout the world." Id., at 102. 

Despite its staff's clear view "that SCR (the most effective individual technology) [was] technologically, environmentally, and economically feasible for the Red Dog power plant engines," id., at 103-104, ADEC endorsed the alternative proffered  by Cominco.  To achieve nitrogen oxide emission reductions commensurate with SCR's 90% impact, Cominco proposed fitting the new generator MG-17 and the six existing generators with Low NOx.  Ibid.8Two generators already were fitted with a technology called Fuel Injection Timing Retard that results in a 20% to 30% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. App. 75-76, 86. Cominco asserted that it could lower net emissions by 396 tons per year if it fitted all seven generators with Low NOx rather than fitting two (MG-5 and MG-17) with SCR and choosing one of them as the standby unit.  Id., at 87.  Cominco's proposal hinged on the "assumption . . . that under typical operating conditions one or more engines will not be running due to maintenance of standby-generation capacity." Ibid. If all seven generators ran continuously, however, Cominco's alternative would increase emissions by 79 tons per year.  Ibid. Accepting Cominco's submission, ADEC stated that Cominco's Low NOx solution "achieve[d] a similar maximum NOx reduction as the most stringent controls; [could] potentially result in a greater NOx reduction; and is logistically and economically less onerous to Cominco." Id., at 87-88. 

 On the final day of the public comment period, June 2, 1999, the United States Department of the Interior, National Parks Service (NPS), submitted comments to ADEC.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a; App. 97, 108.  NPS objected to the projected offset of new emissions from MG-5 and MG-17 against emissions from other existing generators that were not subject to BACT.  Letter from John Notar, NPS Air Resources Division, to Jim Baumgartner, ADEC (June 2, 1999).  Such an offset, NPS commented, "is neither allowed by BACT, nor achieves the degree of reduction that would result if all the generators that are subject to BACT were equipped with SCR." Id., at 3.  NPS further observed that the proposed production-increase project would remove operating restrictions that the 1994 PSD permit had placed on four of the existing generators--MG-1, MG-3, MG-4,  and MG-5.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  Due to that alteration, NPS urged, those generators, too, became part of the production-expansion project and would be subject to the BACT requirement.  Ibid.

 Following NPS' lead, EPA wrote to ADEC on July 29, 1999, commenting: "Although ADEC states in its analysis that [SCR], the most stringent level of control, is economically and technologically feasible, ADEC did not propose to require SCR. . . . [O]nce it is determined that an emission unit is subject to BACT, the PSD program does not allow the imposition of a limit that is less stringent than BACT." App. 96-97.  A permitting authority, EPA agreed with NPS, could not offset new emissions "by imposing new controls on other emission units" that were not subject to BACT.  Id., at 97.  New emissions could be offset only against reduced emissions from sources covered by the same BACT authorization.  Id., at 285-286.  EPA further agreed with NPS that, based on the existing information, BACT would be required for MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5.  Id., at 97. 

After receiving EPA comments, ADEC issued a second draft PSD permit and technical analysis report on September 1, 1999, again finding Low NOx to be BACT for MG-17.  Id., at 105-117.  Abandoning the emissions-offsetting justification advanced in the May 4 draft permit, ADEC agreed with NPS and EPA that "emission reductions from sources that were not part of the permit action," here MG-1, MG-2, MG-3, MG-4, MG-5, and MG-6, could not be considered in determining BACT for MG-17. Id., at 111; id., at 199 (same). 9Rather than subject MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5 to BACT, ADEC and Cominco "agreed to permit conditions that would require low NOx controls on MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5, and emission limits that reflect the previous 'bubbled' limits.  Under this approach, the permit would result in no increase in actual or allowable emissions from any of these engines and the installation of BACT would not be necessary for these four units." Id., at 149.  EPA found no cause to question this ADEC-Cominco agreement.  Ibid.

 ADEC conceded that, lacking data from Cominco, it had made "no judgment . . . as to the impact of . . . [SCR] on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine." Id., at 116.  Contradicting its May 1999 conclusion that SCR was "technically and economically feasible," see supra, at 476, 157 L Ed 2d, at 989, ADEC found in September 1999 that SCR imposed "a disproportionate cost" on the mine.  App. 116.  ADEC concluded, on a "cursory review," that requiring SCR for a rural Alaska utility would lead to a 20% price increase, and that in comparison with other BACT technologies, SCR came at a "significantly higher" cost.  Ibid. No economic basis for a comparison between the mine and a rural utility appeared in ADEC's technical analysis. 

EPA protested the revised permit.  In a September 15, 1999, letter, the Agency stated: "Cominco has not adequately demonstrated any site-specific factors to support their claim that the installation of [SCR] is economically infeasible at the Red Dog Mine.  Therefore, elimination of SCR as BACT based on cost-effectiveness grounds is not supported by the record and is clearly erroneous." Id., at 127; see id., at 138 (ADEC's record does not support the departure from ADEC's initial view that the costs for SCR were economically feasible). 

To justify the September 1, 1999, permit, EPA suggested, ADEC could "include an analysis of whether requiring Cominco to install and operate [SCR] would have any adverse economic impacts upon Cominco specifically." Id., at 127.  Stating that such an inquiry was unnecessary and expressing "concerns related to confidentiality," Cominco declined to submit financial data.  Id., at 134.  In this regard, Cominco simply asserted, without detail, that the company's "overall debt remains quite high" despite continuing profits.  Id., at  134-135.  Cominco also invoked the need for "[i]ndustrial development in rural Alaska." Id., at 135. 

On December 10, 1999, ADEC issued the final permit and technical analysis report.  Once again, ADEC approved Low NOx as BACT for MG-17 "[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region." Id., at 208.  ADEC did not include the economic analysis EPA had suggested.  Id., at 152-246.  Indeed, ADEC conceded again that it had made "no judgment . . . as to the impact of . . . [SCR's] cost on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine." Id., at 207.  Nonetheless, ADEC advanced, as cause for its decision, SCR's adverse effect on the mine's "unique and continuing impact on the economic diversity of th[e] region" and on the venture's "world competitiveness." Id., at 208.  ADEC did not explain how its inferences of adverse effects on the region's economy or the mine's "world competitiveness" could be made without financial information showing SCR's impact on the "operation, profitability, and competitiveness" of the mine.  Id., at 207, 299.  Instead, ADEC reiterated its rural Alaska utility analogy, and again compared SCR's cost to the costs of other, less stringent, control technologies. Id., at 205-207. 

The same day, December 10, 1999, EPA issued an order to ADEC, under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7413(a)(5) and 7477 [42 USCS §§ 7413(a)(5) and 7477], prohibiting ADEC from issuing a PSD permit to Cominco "unless ADEC satisfactorily documents why SCR is not BACT for the Wartsila diesel generator [MG-17]." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a.  In the letter accompanying the order, the Agency stated that "ADEC's own analysis supports the determination that BACT is [SCR], and that ADEC's decision in the proposed permit therefore is both arbitrary and erroneous." App. 149. 

On February 8, 2000, EPA, again invoking its authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act, issued a second order,  this time prohibiting Cominco from beginning "construction or modification activities at the Red Dog mine." App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  A third order, issued on March 7, 2000, superseding and vacating the February 8 order,  generally prohibited Cominco from acting on ADEC's December 10 PSD permit but allowed limited summer construction.  Id., at 62a-64a.  On April 25, 2000, EPA withdrew its December 10 order.  App. 300; App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a.  Once ADEC issued the permit, EPA explained, that order lacked utility.  On July 16, 2003, ADEC granted Cominco a PSD permit to construct MG-17 with SCR as BACT.  Letter from Theodore B. Olson, Solicitor General, to William K. Suter, Clerk of the Court (Aug. 21, 2003).  Under the July 16, 2003, permit, SCR ceases to be BACT "if and when the case currently pending before the Supreme Court of the United States of America is decided in favor of the State of Alaska." ADEC, Air Quality Construction Permit, Final Technical Analysis Report,  Permit No. 9932-AC005, Revision 2, p 7. 

The day EPA issued its first order against Cominco, February 8, 2000, ADEC and Cominco petitioned the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for review of EPA's orders.  App. 11.  The Agency initially moved to dismiss, urging that the Court of Appeals lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  In an order released March 27, 2001, the Ninth Circuit concluded that it had adjudicatory authority pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1) [42 USCS § 7607(b)(1)], which lodges jurisdiction over challenges to "any . . . final [EPA] action" in the Courts of Appeals.  Alaska v. United States EPA, 244 F.3d 748, 750-751. 10At oral argument, counsel for EPA confirmed that the Agency no longer questions the Court of Appeals' adjudicatory authority, satisfied that the finality requirement was met because the stop-construction order imposed "new legal obligations on Cominco." Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44 (punctuation omitted).

The Court of Appeals resolved the merits in a judgment released July 30, 2002.  298 F.3d 814 (CA9).  It held that  EPA had authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 to issue the contested orders, and that the Agency had properly exercised its discretion in doing so.  Id., at 820-823.  Concerning EPA's authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, the Court of Appeals observed first that "the question presented is what requirements the state must meet" under the Act to issue a PSD permit, not what the correct BACT might be.  Id., at 821 (emphasis in original).  Concluding that EPA had "authority to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the state's justification for its decision," the Court of Appeals emphasized that the "provision of a reasoned justification" by a permitting authority is undeniably a "requirement" of the Act.  Ibid. EPA had properly exercised its discretion in issuing the three orders, the Ninth Circuit ultimately determined, because (1) Cominco failed to "demonstrat[e] that SCR was economically infeasible," and (2) "ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option." Id., at 823.  We granted certiorari, 537 U.S. 1186, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1017, 123 S. Ct. 1253 (2003), to resolve an important question of federal law, i.e., the scope of EPA's authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, and now affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment. 

II 

 ADEC contested EPA's orders under 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1) [42 USCS § 7607(b)(1)], which renders reviewable in the appropriate federal court of appeals any EPA "final action." Before the Ninth Circuit, EPA unsuccessfully urged that its orders were "interlocutory,"  and therefore unreviewable in court unless and until EPA chose to commence an enforcement action. 11Such an action would lie in district court, under 42 U.S.C. § 7413(b) [42 USCS § 7413(b)]. A preenforcement contest could be maintained in the Court of Appeals under § 7607(b)(1), the Ninth Circuit held, for in the circumstances presented, EPA's actions had the requisite finality. 

 It was undisputed, the Court of Appeals observed, that EPA had spoken its "'last word'" on whether ADEC had adequately justified its conclusion that Low NOx was the best available control technology for the MG-17 generator. 244 F.3d at 750.  Further, EPA's orders effectively halted construction of the  MG-17 generator, for Cominco would risk civil and criminal penalties if it defied a valid EPA directive. 

In this Court, EPA agrees with the Ninth Circuit's finality determination.  See Brief for Respondents 16-20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44.  We are satisfied that the Court of Appeals correctly applied the guides we set out in Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-178, 137 L. Ed. 2d 281, 117 S. Ct. 1154 (1997) (to be "final," agency action must "mark the 'consummation' of the agency's decisionmaking process," and must either determine "rights or obligations" or occasion "legal consequences" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  As the Court of Appeals stated, EPA had "asserted its final position on the factual circumstances" underpinning the Agency's orders, 244 F.3d at 750, and if EPA's orders survived judicial review, Cominco could not escape the practical and legal consequences (lost costs and vulnerability to penalties) of any ADEC-permitted construction Cominco endeavored, ibid.

No question has been raised here, we note, about the adequacy of EPA's preorder procedures under the Due Process Clause or the Administrative Procedure Act.  Cf. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,435 U.S. 519, 544, 55 L. Ed. 2d 460, 98 S. Ct. 1197 (1978) (agencies have authority to "fashion their own rules of procedure," even when a statute does not specify what process to use).  Furthermore, in response to ADEC's initial contention that the record was incomplete, the Ninth Circuit gave EPA an opportunity to supplement the record, and thereafter obtained from all parties agreement "that the record as it stood was adequate to resolve [ADEC's review petition]." 298 F.3d at 818. 

 III 

A 

 Centrally at issue in this case is the question whether EPA's oversight role, described by Congress in CAA §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, see supra, at ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 987, extends to ensuring that a state permitting authority's BACT determination is reasonable in light of the statutory guides.  Sections 113(a)(5) and 167lodge in the Agency encompassing supervisory responsibility over the construction and modification of pollutant emitting facilities in areas covered by the PSD program.  42 U.S.C. §§ 7413(a)(5) and 7477 [42 USCS §§ 7413(a)(5) and 7477].  In notably capacious terms, Congress armed EPA with authority to issue orders stopping construction when "a State is not acting in compliance with any [CAA] requirement or prohibition . . . relating to the construction of new sources or the modification of existing sources," § 7413(a)(5), or when "construction or modification of a major emitting facility . . . does not conform to the requirements of [the PSD program]," § 7477. 

The federal Act enumerates several "[p]reconstruction requirements" for the PSD program.  § 7475.  Absent these, "[n]o major emitting facility . . . may be constructed." Ibid. One express preconstruction requirement is inclusion of a BACT determination in a facility's PSD permit.  §§ 7475(a)(1) and (4).  As earlier set out, see supra, at ___ - ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 986-987, the Act defines BACT as "an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction of [a] pollutant . . . which  the permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [a] facility." § 7479(3).  Under this formulation, the permitting authority, ADEC here, exercises primary or initial responsibility for identifying BACT in line with the Act's definition of that term. 

All parties agree that one of the "many requirements in the PSD provisions that the EPA may enforce" is "that a  [PSD] permit contain a BACT limitation." Brief for Petitioner 34; see id., at 22, 25 (same).  See also Brief for Respondents 23.  It is therefore undisputed that the Agency may issue an order to stop a facility's construction if a PSD permit contains no BACT designation. 

 EPA reads the Act's definition of BACT, together with CAA's explicit listing of BACT as a "[p]reconstructionrequiremen[t]," to mandate not simply a BACT designation, but a determination of BACT faithful to the statute's definition.  In keeping with the broad oversight role §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 vest in EPA, the Agency maintains, it may review permits to ensure that a State's BACT determination is reasonably moored to the Act's provisions.  See id., at 24.  We hold, as elaborated below, that the Agency has rationally construed the Act's text and that EPA's construction warrants our respect and approbation. 

BACT's statutory definition requires selection of an emission control technology that results in the "maximum" reduction of a pollutant "achievable for [a] facility" in view of "energy, environmental, and economic impacts, and other costs." 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3) [42 USCS § 7479(3)].  This instruction, EPA submits, cabins state permitting authorities' discretion by granting only "authority to make reasonable BACT determinations," Brief for Respondents 27 (emphasis in original), i.e., decisions made with fidelity to the Act's purpose "to insure that economic growth will occur in a manner consistent with the preservation of existing clean air resources," 42 U.S.C. § 7470(3) [42 USCS § 7470(3)].  Noting that state permitting authorities' statutory discretion is constrained by CAA's strong, normative terms "maximum" and "achievable," § 7479(3), 12Formulations similar to the BACT definition's "maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction . . . achievable" appear in the Act's standards for new sources in nonattainment areas, 42 USC §§ 7501(3) and 7503(a)(2) [42 USCS §§ 7501(3) and 7503(a)(2)] ("lowest achievable emission rate") (internal quotation marks omitted), and its technology-based standard for hazardous emissions, § 7412(d)(2) ("maximum degree of reduction . . . achievable"). EPA reads §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 to empower the federal Agency to check a state agency's unreasonably lax BACT designation. See Brief for Respondents 27. 

EPA stresses Congress' reason for enacting the PSD program--to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in clean-air areas within a State and in neighboring States.  §§ 7470(3), (4); see id., at 33.  That aim, EPA urges, is unlikely to be realized absent an EPA surveillance role that extends to BACT determinations.  The Agency notes in this regard a House Report observation: "Without national guidelines for the prevention of significant deterioration a State deciding to protect its clean air resources will face a double threat.  The prospect is very real that such a State would  lose existing industrial plants to more permissive States.  But additionally the State will likely become the target of "economic-environmental blackmail" from new industrial plants that will play one State off against another with threats to locate in whichever State adopts the most permissive pollution controls." H. R. Rep. No. 95-294, p 134 (1977).

The House Report further observed that "a community that sets and enforces strict standards may still find its air polluted from sources in another community or another State." Id., at 135 (quoting 116 Cong. Rec. 32909 (1970)).  Federal agency surveillance of a State's BACT designation is needed, EPA asserts, to restrain the interjurisdictional pressures to which Congress was alert.  See Brief for Respondents 33-34, 43;  Brief for Vermont et al. as Amici Curiae 12 ("If EPA has authority to ensure a reasonable level of consistency among BACT determinations nationwide, then every State can feel more confident about maintaining stringent standards without fear of losing its current industry or alienating prospective industry."). 

 The CAA construction EPA advances in this litigation is reflected in interpretive guides the Agency has several times published.  See App. 268-269 (1983 EPA PSD guidance memorandum noting the Agency's "oversight function"); id., at 274 (1988 EPA guidance memorandum stating EPA may find a BACT determination deficient if it is "not based on a reasoned analysis"); id., at 281-282 (1993 guidance memorandum stating that "EPA acts to ensure that the state exercises its discretion within the bounds of the law" (internal quotation marks omitted); as to BACT, EPA will not intervene if the state agency has given "a reasoned justification for the basis of its decision" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See also Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Commonwealth of Virginia--Prevention of Significant Deterioration Program,63 Fed. Reg. 13797 (1998) (EPA will "review whether any determination by the permitting authority was made on reasonable grounds properly supported on the record, described in enforceable terms, and consistent with all applicable requirements").  We "normally accord particular deference to an agency interpretation of 'longstanding' duration," Barnhart v. Walton,535 U.S. 212, 220, 152 L. Ed. 2d 330, 122 S. Ct. 1265 (2002) (quoting North Haven Bd. of Ed. v. Bell,456 U.S. 512, 522, n. 12, 72 L. Ed. 2d 299, 102 S. Ct. 1912 (1982)), recognizing that "well-reasoned views" of an expert administrator rest on "'a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance,'" Bragdon v. Abbott,524 U.S. 624, 642, 141 L. Ed. 2d 540, 118 S. Ct. 2196 (1998) (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,323 U.S. 134, 139-140, 89 L. Ed. 124, 65 S. Ct. 161 (1944)). 

 We have previously accorded dispositive effect to EPA's interpretation of an ambiguous CAA provision.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 865-866, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984); Union Elec.,427 U.S. 246, at 256, 49 L. Ed. 2d 474, 96 S. Ct. 2518.  The Agency's interpretation in this case, presented in internal guidance memoranda, however, does not qualify for the dispositive force described inChevron See Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621, 120 S. Ct. 1655 (2000) ("Interpretations  such as those in . . . policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law--do not warrant Chevron-style deference."); accord United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 234, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292, 121 S. Ct. 2164 (2001).  Cogent "administrative interpretations . . . not [the] products of formal rulemaking . . . nevertheless warrant respect." Wash. State Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 385, 154 L. Ed. 2d 972, 123 S. Ct. 1017 (2003).  We accord EPA's reading of the relevant statutory provisions, §§ 7413(a)(5), 7470(3), 7470(4), 7475(a)(4), 7477, and 7479(3), that measure of respect. 

B 

 ADEC assails the Agency's construction of the Act on several grounds.  Its arguments do not persuade us to reject as impermissible EPA's longstanding, consistently maintained interpretation. 

 ADEC argues that the statutory definition of BACT, § 7479(3), unambiguously assigns to "the permitting authority" alone determination of the control technology qualifying as "best available." Brief for Petitioner 21-26.  Because the Act places responsibility for determining BACT with "the permitting authority," ADEC urges, CAA excludes federal Agency surveillance reaching the substance of the BACT decision.  Id., at 22-25.  EPA's enforcement role, ADEC maintains, is restricted to the requirement "that the permit contain a BACT limitation." Id., at 34. 

 Understandably, Congress entrusted state permitting authorities with initial responsibility to make BACT determinations "case-by-case." § 7479(3).  A state agency, no doubt, is best positioned to adjust for local differences in raw materials or plant configurations, differences that might make a technology "unavailable" in a particular area.  But the fact that the relevant statutory guides--"maximum" pollution reduction, considerations of energy, environmental, and economic impacts--may not yield a "single, objectively 'correct' BACT determination," id., at 23, surely does not  signify that there can be no unreasonable determinations.  Nor does Congress' sensitivity to site-specific factors necessarily imply a design to preclude in this context meaningful EPA oversight under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167.  EPA claims no prerogative to designate the correct BACT; the Agency asserts only the authority to guard against unreasonable designations. See 298 F.3d at 821 ("the question presented is what requirements the state must meet," not what final substantive decision the State must make (emphasis in original)). 13 The dissent admonishes that "a statute is to be read as a whole." Post, at 504, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1006 (quoting King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,502 U.S. 215, 221, 116 L. Ed. 2d 578, 112 S. Ct. 570 (1991)).  We give that unexceptional principle effect by attending both to the unequivocal grant of supervisory authority to EPA in §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, and to the statutory control on permitting authorities' discretion contained in the BACT definition, 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3) [42 USCS § 7479(3)].  It is, moreover, "a cardinal principle of statutory construction' that 'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant." TRW Inc. v. Andrews,534 U.S. 19, 31, 151 L. Ed. 2d 339, 122 S. Ct. 441 (2001) (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001)).  The Act instructs permitting authorities to identify the "best," "maximum" emission reduction technique, taking account of costs.  42 U.S.C. § 7479(3) [42 USCS § 7479(3)].  The dissent does not explain how that instruction can be construed as something other than a constraint on permitting authorities' discretion.  Ultimately, the dissent recognizes the essential statutory requirement: selection of "the technology that can best reduce pollution within practical constraints." Post, at ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1007 (emphasis added). Nor do we find enlightening Congress' inclusion of the word "determines" in the BACT definition.  Post, at ___, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1005.  Even under the dissent's view of the Act, state permitting authorities' BACT determinations are not "conclusiv[e] and authoritativ[e]." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  As the dissent develops at length, review of such BACT determinations may be sought in state court. Post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1005-1008; Alaska Stat. § 44.62.560 (2002).  And EPA actions, of course, are subject to "the process of judicial review," see post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1005, Congress empowered federal courts to provide, here in 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1) [42 USCS § 7607(b)(1)].  See supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 992-993.

 Under ADEC's interpretation,  EPA properly inquires whether a BACT determination appears in a PSD permit,  Brief for Petitioner 34, but not whether that BACT determination "was made on reasonable grounds properly supported on the record," 63 Fed. Reg., at 13797. Congress, however, vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA "requirements" relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT.  We fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agency from verifying substantive compliance with the BACT provisions and, instead, limit EPA's superintendence to the insubstantial question whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words "BACT." 

 We emphasize, however, that EPA's rendition of the Act's less than crystalline text leaves the "permitting authority" considerable leeway.  The Agency acknowledges "the need to accord appropriate deference" to States' BACT designations, Brief for Respondents 43, and disclaims any intention to "'second guess' state decisions," 63 Fed. Reg., at 13797. Only when a state agency's BACT determination is "not based on a reasoned analysis," App. 274, may EPA step in to ensure that the statutory requirements are honored. 14 According to the Agency, "[i]t has proven to be relatively rare that a state agency has put EPA in the position of having to exercise [its] authority," noting that only two other reported judicial decisions concern EPA orders occasioned by States' faulty BACT determinations.  Brief for Respondents 30, and n 9 (citing Allsteel, Inc. v. EPA, 25 F.3d 312 (CA6 1994), and Solar Turbines Inc. v. Seif, 879 F.2d 1073 (CA3 1989)).  EPA's restrained and moderate use of its authority hardly supports the dissent's speculation that the federal Agency will "displac[e]" or "degrad[e]" state agencies or relegate them to the performance of "ministerial" functions. Post, at ____, ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 991, 992-993.  Nor has EPA ever asserted authority to override a state-court judgment.  Cf. post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1010.  Preclusion principles, we note in this regard, unquestionably do apply against the United States, its agencies and officers.  See, e.g., Montana v. United States,440 U.S. 147, 59 L. Ed. 2d 210, 99 S. Ct. 970 (1979). EPA  adhered to that limited role here, explaining why ADEC's BACT determination was "arbitrary" and contrary to ADEC's own findings.  Id., at 149-150.  EPA's limited but vital role in enforcing BACT is consistent with a scheme that "places primary responsibilities and authority with the States, backed by the Federal Government." S. Rep. No. 95-127, p 29. 

 ADEC also points to 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(8) [42 USCS § 7475(a)(8)], a provision of the Act expressly requiring, in a limited category  of cases, EPA approval of a state permitting authority's BACT determination before a facility may be constructed.  See Brief for Petitioner 25; Reply Brief for Petitioner 6.  Had Congress intended EPA superintendence of BACT determinations, ADEC urges, Congress would have said so expressly by mandating Agency approval of all, not merely some, BACT determinations.  Brief for Petitioner 25-26.  ADEC's argument overlooks the obvious difference between a statutory requirement, e.g., § 7475(a)(8), and a statutory authorization.Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations, they simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily.  EPA recognizes that its authorization to issue a stop order may be exercised only when a state permitting authority's decision is unreasonable; in contrast, a required approval may be withheld if EPA would come to a different determination on the merits.  See, e.g., 57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (1992) ("EPA acknowledges that states have the primary role in administering and enforcing the various components of the PSD program.  States have been largely successful in this effort, and EPA's involvement in interpretative and enforcement issues is limited to only a small number of cases."). 

 Even if the Act imposes a requirement of reasoned justification for a BACT determination, ADEC ultimately argues, such a requirement may be enforced only through state administrative  and judicial processes.  Brief for Petitioner 34-38. 15From the availability of state-court judicial review, the dissent concludes, it necessarily "follows that EPA . . . must take the same procedural steps," of filing suit in state court, as any other person or entity seeking to challenge the issuance of a PSD permit.  Post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009.  Interpreted otherwise, the dissent asserts, the Act contains a "loophole" that allows an EPA "end run around the State's process." Post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1010.  In designing the Act, however, Congress often gave EPA a choice of enforcement measures.  For example, EPA has three options to address a failure to comply with new source requirements.  Compare 42 U.S.C. § 7413(a)(5)(A) [42 USCS § 7413(a)(5)(A)] (EPA may "issue an order prohibiting the construction or modification of any major stationary source"), with § 7413(a)(5)(B) (EPA may "issue an administrative penalty order"), and § 7413(a)(5)(C) (EPA may "bring a civil action").  Other sections of the Act provide EPA with similar options.  See, e.g., §§ 7413(a)(1)-(3).  Following the dissent's logic, EPA's authority to bring a civil action would rule out, as a "loophole," its authority to issue a stop-construction order. Moreover, the existence of concurrent authority is hardly at odds with the Act.  As ADEC itself concedes, EPA can issue a checking order if a PSD permit lacks a BACT determination, Brief for Petitioner 34, even if state-court jurisdiction could be invoked instead. State review of BACT decisions, according to ADEC, allows development of an adequate factual record, properly imposes the burden of persuasion on EPA when it challenges a State's BACT determination, and promotes certainty.  Id., at 36-37.  Unless EPA review of BACT determinations is channeled into state administrative and judicial forums, ADEC suggests, "there is nothing to prevent the EPA from invalidating a BACT determination at any time--months, even years, after a permit has been issued." Id., at 35. 

 It would be unusual, to say the least, for Congress to remit a federal agency enforcing federal law solely to state court.  We decline to read such an uncommon regime into the Act's silence.  EPA, the expert federal agency charged with enforcing the Act, has interpreted the  BACT provisions and its own §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facility's construction.   See supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 991-995.  That rational interpretation, we agree, is surely permissible. 16Experience, we have already noted, see supra, at ____ - ____, n 14, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 997, affords no grounding for the dissent's predictions that EPA oversight, which is undeniably subject to federal-court review, will "rewor[k] . . . the balance between State and Federal Governments" and threaten state courts' independence.  Post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1010-1012.

Nor are we persuaded by ADEC's practical concerns.  We see no reason to conclude that an appropriate record generally cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decision's reasonableness.  ADEC contends that, in this very case, "the State's BACT determination was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit on an incomplete record." Brief for Petitioner 37.  ADEC, however, offers no particulars to back up its assertion that the Court of Appeals proceeded on an inadequate evidentiary record.  We note again that the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record.  298 F.3d at 818.  After the Agency declared that the record was complete, "all the parties effectively agreed that the record as it stood was adequate to resolve the issues on appeal." Ibid.

 As to the burdens of production and persuasion, nothing in the Act suggests that EPA gains a proof-related tactical advantage by issuing a stop-construction order instead of seeking relief through a civil action. But cf. post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009 (EPA authority to issue stop-construction orders creates "the anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State").  Correspondingly, nothing in our decision today invites or permits EPA to achieve an unfair advantage through its choice of litigation forum.  In granting EPA a choice between initiating a civil action and exercising its stop-construction-order authority, see supra, at ____, ____, n 15, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 987, 998, Congress nowhere suggested that the allocation of proof burdens would differ depending upon which enforcement route EPA selected.  The  point ought not to be left in doubt.  Accordingly, we hold that in either an EPA-initiated civil action or a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order filed in state or federal court, the production and persuasion burdens remain with EPA and the underlying question a reviewing court resolves remains the same: Whether the state agency's BACT determination was reasonable, in light of the statutory guides and the state administrative record.  See supra, at ____ - ____, ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 993-994, 997.17 "[L]ooking for the burden of pleading is not a foolproof guide to the allocation of the burdens of proof.  The latter burdens do not invariably follow the pleadings." 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 337, pp 411-412 (5th ed. 1999).  No "single principle or rule . . . solve[s] all cases and afford[s] a general test for ascertaining the incidence" of proof burdens.  9 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, p 288 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) (emphasis deleted).  "[I]n a case of first impression," which we address today, "reference to which party has pleaded a fact is no help at all." McCormick, supra, at 412.  Among other considerations, allocations of burdens of production and persuasion may depend on which party--plaintiff or defendant, petitioner or respondent--has made the "affirmative allegation" or "presumably has peculiar means of knowledge." Wigmore, supra, at 288, 290 (emphases deleted); accord Campbell v. United States,365 U.S. 85, 96, 5 L. Ed. 2d 428, 81 S. Ct. 421 (1961).

The Ninth Circuit's review of EPA's order is in keeping with our holding that EPA may not reduce the burden it must carry by electing to invoke its stop-construction-order authority.  Specifically, the Court of Appeals rested its judgment on what EPA showed from ADEC's own report: "(1) Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating [to ADEC] that SCR was economically infeasible; and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option." 298 F.3d at 823.  EPA's conclusions, and the basis for them, support the Court of Appeals' determination that the federal Agency's grounds for issuing the orders under review were not "arbitrar[y] and capriciou[s]." Ibid. Our own analysis, infra, at 497-502, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1001-1004, similarly hinges on the question whether ADEC's BACT determination was a reasonable one.  Our analysis would have  taken the same path had EPA initiated a civil action pursuant to § 113(a)(5)(C), or if the suit under consideration had been filed initially in state court. 

 Nor do we find compelling ADEC's suggestion, reiterated by the dissent, that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA would be free to invalidate a BACT determination "months, even years, after a permit has been issued." Brief for Petitioner 35; post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1011-1012.  This case threatens no such development.  It involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 990, not postconstruction federal Agency directives.  EPA itself regards it as "imperative" to act on a timely basis, recognizing that courts are "less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the farther planning and construction have progressed." App. 273 (July 15, 1988, EPA guidance memorandum).  In the one instance of untimely EPA action ADEC identifies, the federal courts declined to permit enforcement to proceed.  See United States v. AM General Corp., 34 F.3d 472, 475 (CA7 1994) (affirming District Court's dismissal of an EPA-initiated enforcement action where EPA did not act until well after the facility received a PSD permit and completed plant modifications).  EPA, we are confident, could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and the dissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to review EPA's actions.  Cf. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York,397 U.S. 664, 678-679, 25 L. Ed. 2d 697, 90 S. Ct. 1409 (1970);Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U.S. 218, 223, 72 L. Ed. 857, 48 S. Ct. 451 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting), overruled in part by Alabama v. King & Boozer,314 U.S. 1, 8-9, 86 L. Ed. 3, 62 S. Ct. 43 (1941)). 

 In sum, EPA interprets the Act to allow substantive federal Agency surveillance of state permitting authorities' BACT determinations subject to federal court review.  We credit EPA's longstanding construction of the Act and confirm EPA's authority, pursuant to §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, to rule on the reasonableness of BACT decisions by state permitting authorities. 

  IV 

A 

 We turn finally, and more particularly, to the reasons why we conclude that EPA properly exercised its statutory authority in this case.  ADEC urges that, even if the Act allows the Agency to issue stop-construction orders when a state permitting authority unreasonably determines BACT, EPA acted impermissibly in this instance.  See Brief for Petitioner 39-48.  We note, first, EPA's threshold objection.  ADEC's petition to this Court questioned whether the Act accorded EPA oversight authority with respect to a State's BACT determination.  Pet. for Cert. 13-22.  ADEC did not present, as a discrete issue, the question whether EPA, assuming it had authority to review the substance of a state BACT determination, nevertheless abused its authority by countermanding ADEC's permit for the Red Dog Mine expansion.  See Brief for Respondents 44-45; cf. Reply Brief for Petitioner 15-16, n 12 ("EPA asserts authority to overturn only 'arbitrary or unreasoned' state BACT determinations.  . . .  Thus, whether the State issued a reasoned justification is 'fairly included' within the question presented[.]").  Treating the case-specific issue as embraced within the sole question presented, we are satisfied that EPA did not act arbitrarily in finding that ADEC furnished no tenable accounting for its determination that Low NOx was BACT for MG-17. 

 Because the Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial review in this instance, 18The Court of Appeals referred to 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(9)(A) [42 USCS § 7607(d)(9)(A)] when it considered whether EPA's decision was "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 298 F.3d 814, 822 (CA9 2002).  Section 7607(d)(9), however, applies only to the "subsection" concerning rulemaking in which it is embedded. we apply the familiar default standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) [5 USCS § 706(2)(A)], and ask whether the Agency's action was "arbitrary,  capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."  Even when an agency explains its decision with "less than ideal clarity," a reviewing court will not upset the decision on that account "if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned." Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc.,419 U.S. 281, 286, 42 L. Ed. 2d 447, 95 S. Ct. 438 (1974).  EPA's three skeletal orders to ADEC and Cominco surely are not composed with ideal clarity.  These orders, however, are properly read together with accompanying explanatory correspondence from EPA; so read, the Agency's comments and orders adequately ground the determination that ADEC's acceptance of Low NOx for MG-17 was unreasonable given the facts ADEC found. 

In the two draft permits and the final permit, ADEC formally followed the EPA-recommended top-down methodology to determine BACT,  as Cominco had done in its application.  App. 61, 109, 175; see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 988-989.  Employing that methodology in the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both "technically and economically feasible." App. 65; see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 988-989.  That technology should have been designated BACT absent "technical considerations, or  energy, environmental, or economic impacts justif[ying] a conclusion that [SCR was] not 'achievable' in [this] case." New Source Review Manual, p. B2; App. 61-62.  ADEC nevertheless selected Low NOx as BACT; ADEC did so in May 1999 based on Cominco's suggestion that fitting all Red Dog Mine generators with Low NOx would reduce aggregate emissions. Id., at 87, 111-112; see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 989. 

In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on Cominco's suggestion that it could reduce aggregate emissions by equipping all generators with Low NOx.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 990-991.  ADEC candidly stated that it aimed "[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions  to the region." App. 208.  In these second and third rounds,  ADEC rested its selection of Low NOx squarely and solely on SCR's "disproportionate cost." Id., at 116; id., at 112-117, 203-208; supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 990-991. 

EPA concluded that ADEC's switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record.  See App. 138.  In the September and December 1999 technical analyses, ADEC acknowledged that "no judgment [could then] be made as to the impact of [SCR's] cost on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine." Id., at 116, 207.  ADEC nevertheless concluded that SCR would threaten both the Red Dog Mine's "unique and continuing impact on the economic diversity" of northwest Alaska and the mine's "world competitiveness." Id., at 208.  ADEC also stressed the mine's role as employer in an area with "historical high unemployment and limited permanent year-round job opportunities." Id., at 207. 

 We do not see how ADEC, having acknowledged that no determination "[could] be made as to the impact of [SCR's] cost on the operation . . . and competitiveness of the [mine]," ibid., could simultaneously proffer threats to the mine's operation or competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible.  ADEC, indeed, forthrightly explained why it was disarmed from reaching any judgment on whether, or to what extent, implementation of SCR would adversely affect the mine's operation or profitability: Cominco had declined to provide the relevant financial data, disputing the need for such information and citing "confidentiality" concerns, id., at 134; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 991; 298 F.3d at 823 ("Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that SCR was economically infeasible.").  No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR for its new generator, would be obliged to cut personne, or raise zinc prices.  Absent evidence of that order, ADEC lacked cause  for selecting Low NOx as BACT based on the more stringent control's impact on the mine's operation or competitiveness. 

Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice of Low NOx.  To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production; BACT's cost, in those instances, ranged from $0 to $936 per ton of nitrogen oxide removed.   App. 205-206; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 991.  ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCR's per-ton cost, then estimated as $2,279, to be "well within what ADEC and EPA considers economically feasible." App. 84; cf. id., at 204 (estimating SCR's per ton cost to be $2,100).  No reasoned explanation for ADEC's retreat from this position appears in the final permit.  See id., at 138 ("[SCR's cost falls] well within the range of costs EPA has seen permitting authorities nationwide accept as economically feasible for NOx control except where there are compelling site specific factors that indicate otherwise.").  Tellingly, as to examples of low-cost BACT urged by Cominco, ADEC acknowledged: "The cited examples of engines permitted in Alaska without requiring SCR are not valid examples as they either took place over 18 months ago or were not used for similar purposes." Id., at 233-234 (footnote omitted).  ADEC added that it has indeed "permitted [Alaska] projects requiring SCR." Id., at 234.  Further, EPA rejected ADEC's comparison between the mine and a rural utility, see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 990, because "no facts exist to suggest that the 'economic impact' of the incrementally higher cost of SCR on the world's largest producer of zinc concentrates would be anything like its impact on a rural, non-profit utility that must pass costs on to a small base of individual consumers." Brief for Respondents 49; App. 138-139 (similar observation in Nov. 10, 1999, EPA letter). 

ADEC's basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness "[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region." Id., at 208.  This justification, however, hardly meets ADEC's own standard of a "source-specific . . . economic impac[t] which demonstrate[s] [SCR] to be inappropriate as BACT." Id., at 177.  In short, as the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADEC's BACT designation simply did not qualify as reasonable in light of the statutory guides. 

 In its briefs to this Court, ADEC nonetheless justifies its selection of Low NOx as BACT for MG-17 on the ground that lower aggregate emissions would result from Cominco's "agree[ment] to install Low NOx on all its generators." Brief for Petitioner 42, and n 12 (emphasis added); id., at 29; Reply Brief for Petitioner 19, n 16.  We need not dwell on ADEC's attempt to resurrect Cominco's emissions-offsetting suggestion, see supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 989, adopted in the initial May 1999 draft permit, but thereafter dropped.  As ADEC acknowledges, the final PSD permit did not offset MG-17's emissions against those of the mine's six existing generators, installations that were  not subject to BACT.  Brief for Petitioner 42, n 12; App. 149.  ADEC recognized in September and December 1999 that a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one "bubble" 19Cf. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,467 U.S. 837, 853-859, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984) (upholding EPA regulations allowing States to treat all pollutant-emitting devices within the same stationary source in a nonattainment area as though encased in a single "bubble"). for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is "part of the permit action." Id., at 111, 199.  Offsetting new emissions against those from any of the mine's other generators, ADEC agreed, "[was] not a consideration of the BACT review provided for by the applicable law or guidelines," for those generators remained outside the permit's compass.  Id., at 112, 199.  ADEC plainly did not, and could not, base its December 10, 1999 permit and technical analysis on an emissions-offsetting rationale drawing in generators not subject to BACT.  Id., at 111-112. 20The May 4, 1999, draft permit considered whether adding Low NOx to seven generators would result in lower emissions than adding SCR to only two and choosing one of the latter as a standby unit.  App. 86-87.  Before December 10, 1999, however, Cominco agreed to install Low NOx controls on four of the mine's six existing generators--MG-1, MG-3, MG-4, and MG-5--in order to increase use of those generators without exceeding the 1994 PSD permit's operating restriction.  Id., at 149.  Having agreed to use Low NOx on four generators, Cominco could propose in the December 10, 1999, permit only the addition of Low NOx to two generators--MG-2 and MG-6--to offset increases in emissions from MG-17.  No facts in the record support any suggestion that addition of Low NOx to three generators, MG-2, MG-6, and MG-17, would result in lower aggregate emissions than the addition of SCR to MG-17 alone. By that time, only MG-17 was "part of the permit action." Id., at 111, 199. 

B 

 We emphasize that today's disposition does not impede ADEC from revisiting the BACT determination in question.  In letters and orders throughout the permitting process, EPA repeatedly commented that it was open to ADEC to prepare "an appropriate record" supporting its selection of Low NOx as BACT.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35; see App. 127 (attachment to Sept. 28, 1999, EPA letter to ADEC, stating "an analysis of whether requiring Cominco to install and operate [SCR] would have any adverse economic impacts upon Cominco specifically" might demonstrate SCR's economic infeasibility); id., at 150 (letter accompanying EPA's Dec. 10, 1999, finding of noncompliance and order reiterating the Agency's willingness to "review and consider any additional information or analyses provided by ADEC or Cominco" on Low NOx as BACT); App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a (EPA Dec. 10, 1999, order inviting ADEC to justify its choice of Low NOx by "document[ing] why SCR is not BACT [for MG-17]"); id., at 49a (similar statement in Feb. 8, 2000, order).  At oral argument, counsel for EPA reaffirmed that, "absolutely," ADEC could reconsider the matter and, on an "appropriate  record," endeavor to support Low NOx as BACT.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 35. 21The dissent is daunted by the hypothesis that "[b]ecause there can always be an additional procedure to ensure that the preceding process was followed," the State "may never reach" the goal of issuing a permit. Post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1013 ("The majority creates a sort of Zeno's paradox for state agencies.").  Again, the dissent can point to no instance in which EPA has indulged in any piling of process upon process.  See supra, at ____, n 16, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 999. We see no reason not to take EPA at its word. 

* * * 

 In sum, we conclude that EPA has supervisory authority over the reasonableness of state permitting authorities' BACT determinations and may issue a stop construction order, under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, if a BACT selection is not reasonable.  We further conclude that, in exercising that authority, the Agency did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that ADEC's BACT decision in this instance lacked evidentiary  support.  EPA's orders, therefore, were neither arbitrary nor capricious.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.  


Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. *Justice Souter and Justice Breyer join this opinion in its entirety.  Justice Scalia joins this opinion except for Part III.

Section 330(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(1) [11 USCS § 330(a)(1)], regulates court awards of professional fees, including fees for services rendered by attorneys in connection with bankruptcy proceedings.  Petitioner, a bankruptcy attorney, sought compensation under the section for legal services he provided to a bankrupt debtor after the proceeding was converted to a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His application for fees was denied by the Bankruptcy Court, the District Court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Each court held that in a chapter 7 proceeding § 330(a)(1) does not authorize payment of attorney's fees unless the attorney has been appointed under § 327 of the Code.  See 11 USC §§ 327 and 701 et seq. [11 USCS §§ 327 and 701et seq.] Petitioner  was not so appointed, and his fee request was denied.  Having granted the petition for certiorari to review this holding, we now affirm.

 In 1994 Congress amended the Bankruptcy Code.  Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 (Act), 108 Stat 4106.  The subject of professional fees was addressed and comprehensive changes were made.  See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy P 330.LH[5], pp 330-75 to 330-76 (rev. 15th ed. 2003).  Most of the changes served to clarify the standards for the award of professional fees; but various courts disagree over the proper interpretation of the portion of the statute relevant to this dispute, concerning attorney's fees. 

The Act replaced the predecessor section to the one in issue here.  Compare 108 Stat 4130-4131 (§ 224(b) of the Act was not so appointed, amending 11 USC § 330(a) [11 USCS § 330(a)]), with 11 U.S.C. § 330(a) (1988 ed.)  [11 USCS § 330(a) (1988 ed.)].  Before the 1994 Act, § 330(a) had read as follows: "(a) After notice to any parties in interest and to the United States trustee and a hearing, and subject to sections  326, 328, and 329of this title, the court may award to a trustee, to an examiner,  to a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103of this title, or to the debtor's attorney-- "(1) reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by such trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney . . . and by any paraprofessional persons employed by such trustee, professional person, or attorney . . .; and "(2) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses." Ibid. (emphasis added to highlight text later deleted).

Pursuant to the 1994 Act, 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(1) [11 USCS § 330(a)(1)] now reads as follows: "(a)(1) After notice to the parties in interest and the United States Trustee and a hearing, and subject to sections 326, 328, and 329, the court may award to a trustee, an examiner, a professional person employed under section 327 or 1103-- "(A)  reasonable compensation for actual, necessary services rendered by the trustee, examiner, professional person, or attorney and by any paraprofessional person employed by any such person; and "(B) reimbursement for actual, necessary expenses."

As can be noted, the 1994 enactment's principal, substantive alteration was its deletion of the five words at the end of what was § 330(a) and is now § 330(a)(1): "or to the debtor's attorney." 

The deletion created apparent legislative drafting error.  It left current § 330(a)(1) with a missing "or" that infects its grammar (i.e., "an examiner, [or] a professional person . . .").  Furthermore, the Act's inclusion of the word "attorney" in § 330(a)(1)(A) defeats the neat parallelism that otherwise marks the relationship between §§ 330(a)(1) and 330(a)(1)(A) (i.e., in § 330(a)(1): "trustee, . . . examiner, [or] professional person;" in § 330(a)(1)(A): "trustee, examiner, professional  person, or attorney") and so casts some doubt on the proper presence of "attorney." That the pre-1994 text had no grammatical  error and was parallel in its structure strengthens the sense that error exists in the new text. 

The Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, when asked to interpret current § 330(a)(1), concluded that its language was plain irrespective of these quirks and history.  Under the statutory language as written, those courts held, fees may be awarded to attorneys for services rendered only to the extent they are payments to "a professional person employed under § 327," see, e.g.,§ 327(a) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy action to "employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties under this title"); § 327(e) (authorizing an appointed trustee in a chapter 7 bankruptcy action to "employ, for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, . . .").  See In re Pro-Snax Distributors, Inc., 157 F.3d 414 (CA5 1998); In re American Steel Prod., Inc., 197 F.3d 1354 (CA11 1999).  The Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits, in contrast, concluded that the text's apparent errors rendered the section ambiguous, requiring consideration of the provision's legislative history.  That history, those courts held, shows Congress intended § 330(a)(1) to continue to allow compensation of chapter 7 debtors' attorneys, irrespective of qualification under § 327.  In re Ames Dep't Stores, 76 F.3d 66 (CA2 1996); In re Top Grade Sausage, Inc., 227 F.3d 123 (CA3 2000); United States Trustee v. Garvey, Schubert & Barer (In re Century Cleaning Servs.), 195 F.3d 1053 (CA9 Cir. 1999).  See also 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, supra, P 330.LH[5], at 330-75 to 330-76. 

 This interpretive divide became relevant to petitioner in his representation of Equipment Services, Inc. (ESI).  ESI retained petitioner to prepare, file, and prosecute a chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding on its behalf.  He did so, all the  while representing ESI with the approval of the court under § 327.  See In re Equipment Services, Inc., 290 F.3d 739, 742 (CA4 2002) (case below).  See also 11 U.S.C. § 1107(a) [11 USCS § 1107(a)] (authorizing debtor-in-possession to exercise the statutory rights and powers of an estate trustee, including to retain counsel under § 327).  Three months into the chapter 11 reorganization, the United States Trustee (Government) filed a motion to convert the action into a chapter 7 liquidation proceeding.  The court granted the Government's motion and appointed an estate trustee pursuant to § 701, 11 U.S.C. § 701(a) [11 USCS § 701(a)].  This terminated ESI's status as debtor-in-possession and so terminated petitioner's service under § 327 as an attorney for the debtor-in-possession. Yet petitioner continued to provide legal services to ESI, the debtor, even though he did not have the trustee's authorization to do so.  He prepared reports detailing debts incurred and property acquired since the initial filing; he amended asset schedules; and he appeared at a hearing on an adversary complaint. 

In due course petitioner filed an application seeking fees under § 330(a)(1) for the time he spent on ESI's behalf after the chapter 7 conversion.  The Government objected to the application.  It argued that § 330(a)(1) makes no provision for the estate to compensate an attorney not authorized under § 327.  The court agreed and denied the fees.  In  re Equipment Servs., 253 B.R. 724 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Va. 2000).  (Petitioner was paid fees for the services he provided to ESI before conversion of the proceeding to chapter 7 and when ESI was the debtor-in-possession. The parties do not contest those fees.) 

Petitioner unsuccessfully sought reversal of the Bankruptcy Court's determination, first from the District Court, see In re Equipment Services, Inc., 260 B.R. 273 (WD Va. 2001), then from the Court of Appeals, see 290 F.3d 739.  Both courts concluded the plain language of § 330(a)(1) controlled and that attorneys who provide services to debtors in chapter 7 proceedings must be hired by the trustee under § 327 to be eligible for compensation.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its holding deepened the divide among the various Circuits, but held fast to the statute's plain language, "particularly because application of that plain language supports a reasonable interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code," 290 F.3d, at 745.  We granted the petition for certiorari, 538 U.S. 905, 155 L. Ed. 2d 223, 123 S. Ct. 1480 (2003), and now resolve the issue. 

II 

Petitioner argues that the existing statutory text is ambiguous and so requires us to consult legislative history to determine whether Congress intended to allow fees for services rendered by a debtor's attorney in a chapter 7 proceeding, where that attorney is not authorized under § 327.  He makes the case for ambiguity, for the most part, by comparing the present statute with its predecessor. Thus, he says the statute is ambiguous because subsection (A)'s "attorney" is "facially irreconcilable" with the section's first part since "[e]itherCongress inadvertently omitted the 'debtor's attorney' from the 'payees' list, on which the court of appeals relied, or it inadvertently retained the reference to the attorney in the latter, 'payees list'." Brief for Petitioner 17.

Similarly, with respect to the missing conjunction "or" he says,  "[t]here is no apparent reason, other than a drafting error, that Congress would have rewritten the statute to produce a grammatically incorrect provision." Ibid.

 This is the analysis followed by the Courts of Appeals that hold the statute is ambiguous. See In re Top Grade Sausage, supra, at 129 (noting in its search for ambiguity that "[p]rior to amendment, it was undisputed that the repetition of officers in § 330(a)(1)(A) was meant to parallel the officers previously listed in § 330(a)(1)"); see also In re Century Cleaning Servs., 195 F.3d, at 1057-1058 (engaging in same resort to previous enactment to inquire as to the current text's ambiguity).  One determines ambiguity, under this contention, by relying on the grammatical soundness of the prior statute.  That contention is wrong. 

The starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text, see Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, 525 U.S. 432, 438, 142 L. Ed. 2d 881, 119 S. Ct. 755 (1999), and not the predecessor statutes.  It is well established that "when the statute's language is plain, the sole function of the courts--at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd--is to enforce it according to its terms." Hartford Underwriters  Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N. A., 530 U.S. 1, 6, 147 L. Ed. 2d 1, 120 S. Ct. 1942 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.,489 U.S. 235, 241, 103 L. Ed. 2d 290, 109 S. Ct. 1026 (1989) (in turn quoting Caminetti v. United States,242 U.S. 470, 485, 61 L. Ed. 442, 37 S. Ct. 192 (1917))).  So we begin with the present statute. 

A 

 The statute is awkward, and even ungrammatical; but that does not make it ambiguous on the point at issue.  In its first part, the statute authorizes an award of compensation to one of three types of persons: trustees, examiners, and § 327 professional persons.  A debtor's attorney not engaged as provided by § 327 is simply not included within the class of persons eligible for compensation.  In subsection (A) the statute further defines what type of compensation may be awarded: compensation that is reasonable; and for actual, necessary services; and rendered by four types of persons (the same three plus attorneys).  Unless the applicant for compensation is in one of the named classes of persons in the first part, the kind of service rendered is irrelevant. 

The missing conjunction "or" does not change our conclusion.  The Government points to numerous federal statutes that inadvertently lack a conjunction. They are read, nonetheless,  for their plain meaning. See Brief for Respondent 17, n 4.  Here, the missing conjunction neither alters the text's substance nor obscures its meaning.  This is not a case where a "not" is missing or where an "or" inadvertently substitutes for an "and." The sentence may be awkward; yet it is straightforward. 

Subsection (A)'s nonparalleled fourth category of persons who can render compensable services does not cloud the statute's meaning.  Petitioner reasons that since the section is a single sentence, and since it appears to strive for parallelism between those authorized to receive fees and those whose services are compensable, there is an ambiguity as to what "attorney" in § 330(a)(1)(A) refers to in § 330(a)(1).  He also points to neighboring § 331, which provides for both debtors' attorneys and § 327 professional persons to receive interim compensation after an order for relief is entered but before an application for § 330 fees is filed.  He argues that since § 331 contemplates debtors'  attorneys' receiving interim compensation there is reason to conclude that "attorney" in § 330(a)(1)(A) refers to debtors' attorneys in § 330(a)(1), though they go unmentioned in that clause. 

Subsection (A)'s "attorney," however, can be read in a straightforward fashion to refer to those attorneys whose fees are authorized by § 330(a)(1): attorneys qualified as § 327 professional persons, that is, in a chapter 7 context, those employed by the trustee and approved by the court.  See § 327(a) (appointed trustee may "employ one or more attorneys . . . to represent or assist the trustee in carrying out the trustee's duties under this title); § 327(e) (appointed trustee may "employ, for a specified special purpose, other than to represent the trustee in conducting the case, an attorney that has represented the debtor, . . .").  Likewise, § 331's reference to interim compensation for debtors' attorneys most straightforwardly refers to  debtors' attorneys authorized under § 327. 

 It must be acknowledged that, under our reading of the text, the word "attorney" in subsection (A) may well be surplusage. Subsection (A)'s reference to § 327 professional persons undoubtedly includes attorneys, as much as does § 330(a)(1)'s reference to professional persons.  That is not controlling, however.  Surplusage does not always produce ambiguity and our preference for avoiding surplusage constructions is not absolute.  See Chickasaw Nation v. United States,534 U.S. 84, 94, 151 L. Ed. 2d 474, 122 S. Ct. 528 (2001) (the preference "is sometimes offset by the canon that permits a court to reject words 'as surplusage' if 'inadvertently inserted or if repugnant to the rest of the statute'").  Where there are two ways to read the text--either attorney is surplusage, in which case the text is plain; or attorney is nonsurplusage (i.e., it refers to an ambiguous component in § 330(a)(1)), in which case the text is ambiguous--applying the rule against surplusage is, absent other indications, inappropriate.  We should prefer the plain meaning since that approach respects the words of Congress.  In this manner we avoid the pitfalls that plague too quick a turn to the more controversial realm of legislative history. 

B 

 The plain meaning that § 330(a)(1) sets forth does not lead to absurd results requiring us to treat the text as if it were ambiguous. See supra, at 534 540 U.S. 526, 124 S. Ct. 1023, 157 L. Ed. 2d at 1033 (citing Hartford Underwriters).  Petitioner disagrees and argues that our interpretation will "entail an inexplicable, wholesale departure from . . . the guiding principle of the 'prompt and effectual administration' of federal bankruptcy law." Brief for Petitioner 30.  He says that our reading "attribute[s] to Congress an illogical, penny-wise and pound-foolish determination to eliminate entirely--as a purportedly asset-preserving measure--compensation that is essential to debtors' receipt of legal services." Id., at 35. 

These arguments overstate the effect of § 330(a)(1).  Under the text's instruction compensation remains available to  debtors' attorneys through various permitted means.  First, while § 330(a)(1) requires proper authorization for payment to attorneys from estate funds in chapter 7 filings, it does not extend throughout all bankruptcy law. Compensation for debtors' attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies, for example, is not much disturbed by § 330 as a whole.  See, e.g.,11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4)(B) [11 USCS § 330(a)(4)(B)] ("In a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case in which the debtor is an individual, the court may allow reasonable compensation to the debtor's attorney"). 

Compensation for debtors' attorneys working on chapter 7 bankruptcies, moreover, is not altogether prohibited.  Sections 327 and 330, taken together, allow chapter 7 trustees to engage attorneys, including debtors' counsel, and allow courts to award them fees.  See §§ 327(a) and (e).  Section 327's limitation on debtors' incurring debts for professional services without the chapter 7 trustee's approval is not absurd. In the context of a chapter 7 liquidation it advances the trustee's responsibility for preserving the estate. 

If we add to all this the apparent  sound functioning of the bankruptcy system under the plain meaning approach, petitioner's arguments become unconvincing.  Seeming order has attended the rule's application for five years in the Fifth Circuit and for four years in the Eleventh Circuit.  See In re American Steel Prod., Inc., 197 F.3d 1354 (CA11 1999); In re Pro-Snax Distributors, Inc., 157 F.3d 414 (CA5 1998).  It appears to be routine for debtors to pay reasonable fees for legal services before filing for bankruptcy to ensure compliance with statutory requirements.  See generally Collier Compensation, Employment and Appointment of Trustees and Professionals in Bankruptcy Cases P 3.02[1], p 3-2 (2002) ("In the majority of cases, the debtor's counsel will accept an individual or a joint consumer chapter 7 case only after being paid a retainer that covers the 'standard fee' and the cost of filing the petition").  So our interpretation accords with common practice.  Section 330(a)(1)does not  prevent a debtor from engaging counsel before a chapter 7 conversion and paying reasonable compensation in advance to ensure that the filing is in order.  Indeed, the Code anticipates these arrangements.  See, e.g.,§ 329 (debtors' attorneys must disclose fees they receive from a debtor in the year prior to its bankruptcy filing and courts may order excessive payments returned to the estate). 

C 

Petitioner's argument stumbles on still harder ground in the face of another canon of interpretation.  His interpretation of the Act--reading the word "attorney" in § 330(a)(1)(A) to refer to "debtors' attorneys" in § 330(a)(1) --would have us read an absent word into the statute.  That is, his argument would result "not [in] a construction of [the] statute, but, in effect, an enlargement of it by the court, so that what was omitted, presumably by inadvertence, may be included within its scope." Iselin v. United States,270 U.S. 245, 251, 70 L. Ed. 566, 46 S. Ct. 248, 62 Ct. Cl. 755, 1926-1 C.B. 365, Treas. Dec. Int. Rev. 3846 (1926). With a plain, nonabsurd meaning in view, we need not proceed in this way.  "There is a basic difference between filling a gap left by Congress' silence and rewriting rules that Congress has affirmatively and specifically enacted." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham,436 U.S. 618, 625, 56 L. Ed. 2d 581, 98 S. Ct. 2010 (1978). 

Our unwillingness to soften the import of Congress' chosen words even if we believe the words lead to a harsh outcome is longstanding.  It results from "deference to the supremacy of the Legislature, as well as recognition that Congressmen typically vote on the language of a bill." United States v. Locke,471 U.S. 84, 95, 85 L. Ed. 2d 64, 105 S. Ct. 1785 (1985) (citing Richards v. United States,369 U.S. 1, 9, 7 L. Ed. 2d 492, 82 S. Ct. 585 (1962)). 

Adhering to conventional doctrines of statutory interpretation, we hold that § 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors' attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by § 327.  If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under § 330(a)(1) in a chapter  7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court. 

 III 

Though we find it unnecessary to rely on the legislative history behind the 1994 enactment of § 330(a)(1), we find it instructive that the history creates more confusion than clarity  about the congressional intent. History and policy considerations lend support both to petitioner's interpretation and to the holding we reach based on the plain language of the statute. 

Petitioner, for instance, cites evidence supporting the conclusion that a scrivener's error obscures what was Congress' real intent.  For over 100 years debtors' attorneys have been considered by Congress and the courts to be an integral part of the bankruptcy process.  See Bankruptcy Act of 1898, ch 541, §§ 59(d) and 64(b), 30 Stat 561, 563.  See also In re Kross, 96 F. 816 (SDNY 1899).  It is fair to doubt that Congress would so rework their longstanding role without announcing the change in the congressional record.  Cf. Cohen v. de la Cruz,523 U.S. 213, 221, 140 L. Ed. 2d 341, 118 S. Ct. 1212 (1998) ("We . . . will not read the Bankruptcy Code to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear indication that Congress intended such a departure" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 

The legislative processes behind the change also lend some support to petitioner's claim.  In 1994 the original proposed draft of new § 330(a)(1) featured two changes: stylistic changes throughout the section and the addition of a new provision giving the Government a right to object to fee applications.  See S. 540, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993), reprinted in S. Rep. No. 103-168 (1993).  The right to object provision was added at § 330(a)(1)'s end.  Thus it came immediately after the critical text "or to the debtor's attorney," which the draft edited to read "or the debtors [sic] attorney." Ibid. Before voting the Act into law, however, Congress amended the proposed draft.  See 140 Cong. Rec. 8383  (1994) (setting out amendment 1645 to S. 540).  Amendment 1645 made only two changes to § 330(a)(1): It deleted the Government's right to object provision and the critical words ("or the debtors [sic] attorney").  The rest of the original proposed draft remained intact.  Legislative history explains the first deletion, for the provision was installed elsewhere, as new § 330(a)(2).  Nothing, however, explains the second.  That the Government's right to object was deleted and reinstated (i.e., reorganized), while the words at issue, which had preceded the moved provision, were deleted with no notation in the legislative history suggests the scrivener just reached too far in his deletion. These factors combined to convince a leading treatise on bankruptcy law, Collier, that the deletion was a scrivener's error and ought not have any effect.  See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy P 330.LH[5], at 330-75 to 330-76. 

There are other aspects of the legislative record, however, that undermine this interpretation.  These considerations suggest Congress may have intended the change the scrivener worked.  For example,  amendment 1645 was part of a reform Act designed to curtail abuses in fee awards, according to statements by the amendment's sponsor.  See 140 Cong. Rec., at 28753 (statement of Sen. Metzenbaum).  These abuses were not ghosts seen only by Congress.  Some bankruptcy courts had reached the same conclusion.  See, e.g., In re NRG Resources, Inc., 64 B.R. 643 (Bkrtcy Ct WD La 1986).  The deletion at issue furthered this reform by ensuring that chapter 7 debtors' attorneys would receive no estate compensation absent the trustee's authorization of their work.   This objective is not inconsistent with the interest of involving debtors' attorneys in bankruptcy proceedings.  As noted, the Act still allows debtors' attorneys to be compensated in different ways.  See supra, at 536-539, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1035-1036. 

Amendment 1645, viewed in its entirety, gives further reason to think Congress may have intended the change.  The amendment added a new section that authorizes fee awards  to debtors' attorneys in chapter 12 and 13 bankruptcies.  140 Cong. Rec., at 8383 (setting out new 11 U.S.C. § 330(a)(4)(B) [11 USCS § 330(a)(4)(B)]).  Since the amendment's deletion of "or the debtors [sic] attorney" from the original proposed draft affected chapter 12 and 13 debtors' attorneys as much as chapter 7 debtors' attorneys, § 330(a)(4)(B) shows a special intent to authorize the formers' fee awards in the face of the new, broad exclusion. 

If Congress' action does not prove the point, the House of Representatives' inaction may.  The House passed the Act after having the deletion, as well as its impact, called to its attention.  See Bankruptcy Reform: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 551 (1994).  The National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA), which represents those lawyers most likely to be affected by § 330(a)(1)'s change, declined to object to the deletion. Ibid. (noting the deletion but stating that the NACBA did "not oppose" Amendment 1645's passage).  This alert, followed by the Legislature's nonresponse, should support a presumption of legislative awareness and intention.  The Act may now contain surplusage, along with grammatical error; but that may have been the result of trying to make the substantive change with the fewest possible textual alterations or of an error by the scrivener in carrying out the change. 

These competing interpretations of the legislative history make it difficult to say with assurance whether petitioner or the Government lays better historical claim to the congressional intent. The alert to the change in policy was given, to be sure, before the House passed the final version, but that particular circumstance cannot bear too much weight.  The alert was not the subject of testimony from any witness at the congressional hearing.  It consisted of but two sentences contained within 472 pages of written statements delivered to the legislative subcommittee for its August 17,  1994, hearing day.  Those 472 pages were added to 236 pages of prepared statements and testimony transcribed from the day's testifying witnesses.  Within the NACBA's filing, the two relevant sentences appear on the 18th page of the 27-page report.  Nothing in the legislative history confirms that this particular point bore on the congressional deliberations or was given specific consideration. 

These uncertainties illustrate the difficulty of relying on legislative history here and the advantage of our determination to rest our holding on the statutory text. * * * 

 If Congress enacted into law something different from what it intended, then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.  "It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might think . . . is the preferred result." United States v. Granderson,511 U.S. 39, 68, 127 L. Ed. 2d 611, 114 S. Ct. 1259 (1994) (concurring opinion).  This allows both of our branches to adhere to our respected, and respective, constitutional roles.  In the meantime, we must determine intent from the statute before us.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 After a grand jury indicted petitioner John J. Fellers, police officers arrested him at his home.  During the course of the arrest, petitioner made several inculpatory statements.  He argued that the officers deliberately elicited these statements from him outside the presence of counsel, and that the admission at trial of the fruits of those statements therefore violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Petitioner contends that in rejecting this argument, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit improperly held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel  was "not applicable" because "the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home." 285 F.3d 721, 724 (2002).  We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari, 538 U.S. 905, 155 L. Ed. 2d 224, 123 S. Ct. 1480 (2003), and now reverse. 

I 

On February 24, 2000, after a grand jury indicted petitioner for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, Lincoln Police Sergeant Michael Garnett and Lancaster County Deputy Sheriff Jeff Bliemeister went to petitioner's home in Lincoln, Nebraska, to arrest him.  App. 111.  The officers knocked on petitioner's door and, when petitioner answered, identified themselves and asked if they could come in.  Ibid. Petitioner invited the officers into his living room.  Ibid.

The officers advised petitioner they had come to discuss his involvement in methamphetamine distribution.  Id., at 112.  They informed petitioner that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted him for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine. Ibid. The officers told petitioner that the indictment referred to his involvement with certain individuals, four of whom they named.  Ibid. Petitioner then told the officers that he knew the four people and had used methamphetamine during his association with them.  Ibid.

After spending about 15 minutes in petitioner's home, the officers transported petitioner to the Lancaster County jail. Ibid. There, the officers advised petitioner for the first time of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona,384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), and Patterson v. Illinois,487 U.S. 285, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389 (1988).  App. 112.  Petitioner and the two officers signed a Miranda waiver  form, and petitioner then reiterated the inculpatory statements he had made earlier, admitted to having associated with other individuals implicated in the charged conspiracy, App. 29-39, and admitted to having loaned money to one of them even though he suspected that she was involved in drug transactions, id., at 34. 

Before trial,  petitioner moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the county jail. A Magistrate Judge conducted a hearing and recommended that the statements petitioner made at his home be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his Miranda rights.  App. 110-111.  The Magistrate Judge found that petitioner made the statements in response to the officers' "implici[t] questions," noting that the officers had told petitioner that the purpose of their visit was to discuss his use and distribution of methamphetamine. Id., at 110.  The Magistrate Judge further recommended that portions of petitioner's jailhouse statement be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide Miranda warnings. App. 110-111. 

The District Court suppressed the "unwarned" statements petitioner made at his house but admitted petitioner's jailhouse statements pursuant to Oregon v. Elstad,470 U.S. 298, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222, 105 S. Ct. 1285 (1985), concluding petitioner had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights before making the statements.  App. 112-115. 

Following a jury trial at which petitioner's jailhouse statements  were admitted into evidence, petitioner was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Petitioner appealed, arguing that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements obtained at his home in violation of the Sixth Amendment.The Court of Appeals affirmed.  285 F.3d 721 (8th Cir. 2002).  With respect to petitioner's argument that the officers' failure to administer Miranda warnings at his home violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under Patterson, supra, the Court of Appeals stated: "Patterson is not applicable here . . . for the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home." 285 F.3d, at 724.  The Court of Appeals also concluded that the statements from the jail were properly admitted under the rule of Elstad, supra.285 F.3d, at 724 ("'Though Miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made'" (quoting Elstad, supra, at 309, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222, 105 S. Ct. 1285)). 

Judge Riley filed a concurring opinion.  He concluded that during their conversation at petitioner's home, officers "deliberately elicited incriminating information" from petitioner.  285 F.3d, at 726-727.  That "post-indictment conduct outside the presence of counsel," Judge Riley reasoned, violated petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights. Id., at 727.  Judge Riley nevertheless concurred in the judgment, concluding that the jailhouse statements were admissible under the rationale of Elstad in light of petitioner's knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel. 285 F.3d, at 727. 

II 

 The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered "at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated . . . 'whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.'" Brewer v. Williams,430 U.S. 387, 398, 51 L. Ed. 2d 424, 97 S. Ct. 1232 (1977) (quoting Kirby v. Illinois,406 U.S. 682, 689, 32 L. Ed. 2d 411, 92 S. Ct. 1877 (1972)).  We have held that an accused is denied "the basic protections" of the Sixth Amendment "when there [is] used against him at his trial evidence of his own incriminating words, which federal agents . . . deliberately elicited from him after he had been indicted and in the absence of his counsel." Massiah v. United States,377 U.S. 201, 206, 12 L. Ed. 2d 246, 84 S. Ct. 1199 (1964); cf. Patterson v. Illinois, supra (holding that the Sixth Amendment does not bar postindictment questioning in the absence of counsel if a defendant waives the right to counsel). 

We have consistently applied the deliberate-elicitation standard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see United States v. Henry,447 U.S. 264, 270, 65 L. Ed. 2d 115, 100 S. Ct. 2183 (1980) ("The question here is whether under the facts of this case a Government agent 'deliberately elicited' incriminating statements . . . within the meaning of Massiah"); Brewer, supra, at 399, 51 L. Ed. 2d 424, 97 S. Ct. 1232 (finding a Sixth Amendment violation where a detective "deliberately and designedly set out to elicit information from [the suspect]"), and we have expressly distinguished this standard  from the Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, see Michigan v. Jackson,475 U.S. 625, 632, n. 5, 89 L. Ed. 2d 631, 106 S. Ct. 1404 (1986) ("[T]heSixth Amendment provides a right to counsel . . . even when there is no interrogation and no Fifth Amendment applicability"); Rhode Island v. Innis,446 U.S. 291, 300, n. 4, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 100 S. Ct. 1682 (1980) ("The definitions of 'interrogation' under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, if indeed the term 'interrogation' is even apt in the Sixth Amendment context, are not necessarily interchangeable"); cf. United States v. Wade,388 U.S. 218, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, 87 S. Ct. 1926 (1967) (holding that the Sixth Amendment provides the right to counsel at a postindictment lineup even though the Fifth Amendment is not implicated). 

 The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the absence of an "interrogation" foreclosed petitioner's claim that the jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from petitioner at his home.  First, there is no question that the officers in this case "deliberately elicited" information from petitioner.  Indeed, the officers, upon arriving at petitioner's house, informed him that their purpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the distribution of methamphetamine and his association with certain charged co-conspirators.  285 F.3d, at 723; App. 112.  Because the ensuing discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the officers'  actions did not violate the Sixth Amendment standards established in Massiah, supra, and its progeny. 

 Second, because of its erroneous determination that petitioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the Court of Appeals improperly conducted its "fruits" analysis under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, it applied Elstad, to hold that the admissibility of the jailhouse statements turns solely on whether the statements were "'knowingly and voluntarily made.'" 285 F.3d, at 724 (quoting Elstad, 470 U.S., at 309, 84 L. Ed. 2d 222, 105 S. Ct. 1285 ).  The Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendment requires suppression of petitioner's jailhouse statements on the ground that they were the fruits of previous questioning conducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard.  We have not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of Elstad applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards.  We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to address this issue in the first instance. 

Accordingly,  the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. 

Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention (Convention) 1Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Transportation by Air, Oct. 12, 1929, 49 Stat. 3000, T. S. No. 876 (1934), note following 49 U.S.C. § 40105 [USCS International Agreements].imposes liability on an air carrier for a passenger's death or bodily injury caused by an "accident" that occurred in connection with an international flight. In Air France v. Saks, 470 U.S. 392, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338 (1985), the Court explained that the term "accident" in the Convention refers to an "unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger," and not to "the passenger's own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft." Id., at 405, 406, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The issue we must decide is whether the "accident" condition precedent to air carrier liability under Article 17 is satisfied when the carrier's unusual and unexpected refusal to assist a passenger is a link in a chain of causation resulting in a passenger's pre-existing medical condition being aggravated by exposure to a normal condition in the aircraft cabin. We conclude that it is. 

 I 

 The following facts are taken from the District Court's findings, which, being unchallenged by either party, we accept as true.  In December 1997, Dr. Abid Hanson and his wife, Rubina Husain (hereinafter respondent), traveled with their children and another family from San Francisco to Athens and Cairo for a family vacation.  During a stopover in New York, Dr. Hanson learned for the first time that petitioner allowed its passengers to smoke on international  flights. Because Dr. Hanson had suffered from asthma and was sensitive to secondhand smoke, respondent requested and obtained seats away from the smoking section.  Dr. Hanson experienced no problems on the flights to Cairo. 

For the return flights, Dr. Hanson and respondent arrived early at the Cairo airport in order to request non-smoking seats. Respondent showed the check-in agent a physician's letter explaining that Dr. Hanson "has [a] history of recurrent anaphylactic reactions," App. 81, and asked the agent to ensure that their seats were in the non-smoking section.  The flight to Athens was uneventful. 

After boarding the plane for the flight to San Francisco, Dr. Hanson and respondent discovered that their seats were located only three rows in front of the economy-class smoking section.  Respondent advised Maria  Leptourgou, a flight attendant for petitioner, that Dr. Hanson could not sit in a smoking area, and said, "'You have to move him.'" 116 F. Supp. 2d 1121, 1125 (ND Cal. 2000).  The flight attendant told her to "'have a seat.'" Ibid. After all the passengers had boarded but prior to takeoff, respondent again asked Ms. Leptourgou to move Dr. Hanson, explaining that he was "'allergic to smoke.'" Ibid. Ms. Leptourgou replied that she could not reseat Dr. Hanson because the plane was "'totally full'" and she was "too busy" to help.  Ibid.

Shortly after takeoff, passengers in the smoking section began to smoke, and Dr. Hanson was soon surrounded by ambient cigarette smoke. Respondent spoke with Ms. Leptourgou a third time, stating, "'You have to move my husband from here.'" Id., at 1126.  Ms. Leptourgou again refused, stating that the plane was full.  Ms. Leptourgou told respondent that Dr. Hanson could switch seats with another passenger, but that respondent would have to ask other passengers herself, without the flight crew's assistance.  Respondent told Ms. Leptourgou that Dr. Hanson had to move even if the only available seat was in the cockpit or in  business class, but Ms. Leptourgou refused to provide any assistance. 2Dr. Hanson and respondent did not know at the time that, despite Ms. Leptourgou's representations, the flight was actually not full.  There were 11 unoccupied passenger seats, most of which were in economy class, and 28 "non-revenue passengers," 15 of whom were seated in economy class rows farther away from the smoking section than Dr. Hanson's seat. 116 F. Supp. 2d, at 1126.

About two hours into the flight, the smoking noticeably increased in the rows behind Dr. Hanson.  Dr. Hanson asked respondent for a new inhaler because the one he had been using was empty.  Dr. Hanson then moved toward the front of the plane to get some fresher air. While he was leaning against a chair near the galley area, Dr. Hanson gestured to respondent to get his emergency kit.  Respondent returned with it and gave him a shot of epinephrine.  She then awoke Dr. Umesh Sabharwal, an allergist, with whom Dr. Hanson and respondent had been traveling.  Dr. Sabharwal gave Dr. Hanson another shot of epinephrine and began to administer CPR and oxygen.  Dr. Hanson died shortly thereafter. 3For religious reasons, no autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death.Id., at 1128. 

Respondents filed a wrongful-death suit in California state court.  Petitioner removed the case to federal court, and the District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hanson's death.  The District Court held that Ms. Leptourgou's refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson constituted an "accident" within the meaning of Article 17.  Applying Saks' definition of that term, the court reasoned that the flight attendant's conduct was external to Dr. Hanson and, because it was in "blatant disregard of industry standards and airline policies," was not expected or usual.  116 F. Supp. 2d, at 1134. 

The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Applying Saks' definition of "accident," the Ninth Circuit agreed that the flight attendant's refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson "was clearly external to  Dr. Hanson, and it was unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of Dr. Hanson's requested accommodation." Husain v. Olympic Airways, 316 F.3d 829, 837 (2002).  We granted certiorari, 538 U.S. 1056, 123 S. Ct. 2215, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1105 (2003), and now affirm. 

II 

A 

 We begin with the language of Article 17 of the Convention, which provides: 4The Warsaw Convention's governing text is in French.  We cite to the official English translation of the Convention, which was before the Senate when it consented to ratification of the Convention in 1934.  See 49 Stat. 3014; Air France v. Saks,470 U.S. 392, 397, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338 (1985).

"The carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking." 49 Stat. 3018. 5 After a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of liability under Article 17 by showing that the injury was caused by an "accident," the air carrier has the opportunity to prove under Article 20 that it took "all necessary measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for [the airline] to take such measures." 49 Stat. 3019.  Thus, Article 17 creates a presumption of air carrier liability and shifts the burden to the air carrier to prove lack of negligence under Article 20.  Lowenfeld & Mendelsohn, The United States and the Warsaw Convention, 80 Harv. L. Rev. 497, 521 (1967).  Article 22(1) caps the amount recoverable under Article 17 in the event of death or bodily injury, and Article 25(1) removes the cap if the damage is caused by the "wilful misconduct" of the airline or its agent, acting within the scope of his employment.  See 49 Stat. 3019, 3020. Additionally, Article 21 enables an air carrier to avoid or reduce its liability if it can prove the passenger's comparative negligence.  See id., at 3019.

 In Saks, the Court recognized that the text of the Convention does not define the term "accident" and that the context in which it is used is not "illuminating." 470 U.S., at 399, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.   The Court nevertheless discerned the meaning of the term "accident" from the Convention's text, structure, and history as well as from the subsequent conduct of the parties to the Convention. 

Neither party here contests Saks' definition of the term "accident" under Article 17 of the Convention.  Rather, the parties differ as to which event should be the focus of the "accident" inquiry.  The Court's reasoning in Saks sheds light on whether the flight attendant's refusal to assist a passenger in a medical crisis is the proper focus of the "accident" inquiry. 

In Saks, the Court addressed whether a passenger's "'loss of hearing proximately caused by normal operation of the aircraft's pressurization system'" was an "'accident.'" Id., at 395, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The Court concluded that it was not, because the injury was her "own internal reaction" to the normal pressurization of the aircraft's cabin. Id., at 406, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The Court noted two textual clues to the meaning of the term "accident." First, the Convention distinguishes between liability under Article 17 for death or injuries to passengers caused by an "accident" and liability under Article 18 for destruction or loss of baggage caused by an "occurrence." Id., at 398, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The difference in these provisions implies that the meaning of the term "accident" is different from that of "occurrence." Ibid. Second, the Court found significant the fact that Article 17 focuses on the "accident which caused" the passenger's injury and not an accident that is the passenger's injury. Ibid. The Court explained that it is the cause of the injury--rather than the occurrence of the injury--that must satisfy the definition of "accident." Id., at 399, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  And recognizing the Court's responsibility to read the treaty in a manner "consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties," ibid., the Court also looked to the French legal meaning of the term "accident," which when used to describe the cause of an injury, is usually defined as a "fortuitous, unexpected, unusual, or unintended event," id., at 400, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338. 

 Accordingly, the Court held in Saks that an "accident" under Article 17 is "an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger," and not "the passenger's own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft." Id., at 405, 406, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338. 6The term "accident" has at least two plausible yet distinct definitions.  On the one hand, as noted in Saks, "accident" may be defined as an unintended event.  See Webster's New World College Dictionary 8 (4th ed. 1999) ("a happening that is not . . . intended"); see also American Heritage Dictionary 10 (4th ed. 2000) ("[l]ack of intention; chance"); Saks, 470 U.S., at 400, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  On the other hand, as noted in Saks, the term "accident" may be defined as an event that is "unusual" or "unexpected," whether the result of intentional action or not.  Ibid. See Black's Law Dictionary 15 (6th ed. 1990) ("an unusual, fortuitous, unexpected, unforeseen, or unlooked for event, happening or occurrence" and "if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens"); see also American Heritage Dictionary, supra, at 10 ("[a]n unexpected and undesirable event," "[a]n unforeseen incident").  Although either definition of "accident" is at first glance plausible, neither party contests the definition adopted by the Court in Saks, which after careful examination discerned the meaning of "accident" under Article 17 of the Convention as an "unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger." 470 U.S., at 405, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338. The Court emphasized that the definition of "accident" "should be flexibly applied after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger's injuries." Id., at 405, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The Court further contemplated that intentional conduct could fall within the "accident" definition under Article 17, 7The Court cited approvingly several lower court opinions where intentional acts by third parties--namely, torts committed by terrorists--were recognized as "accidents" under a "broa[d]" interpretation of Article 17.  Ibid. (citing lower court cases). an interpretation that comports with another provision of the Convention. 8 Specifically, Article 25removes the cap on air carrier liability when the injury is caused by the air carrier's "wilful misconduct." 49 Stat. 3020.  Because there can be no liability for passenger death or bodily injury under the Convention in the absence of an Article 17 "accident," such "wilful misconduct" is best read to be included within the realm of conduct that may constitute an "accident" under Article 17. As such, Saks correctly characterized the  term "accident" as encompassing more than unintentional conduct. 

The Court focused its analysis on determining "what causes can be considered accidents," and observed that Article 17"embraces causes of injuries" that are "unexpected or unusual." Id., at 404, 405, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The Court did not suggest that only one event could constitute the "accident," recognizing that "[a]ny injury is the product of a chain of causes." Id., at 406, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  Thus, for  purposes of the "accident"  inquiry, the Court stated that a plaintiff need only be able to prove that "some link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger." Ibid.

B 

Petitioner argues that the "accident" inquiry should focus on the "injury producing event," Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, which, according to petitioner, was the presence of ambient cigarette smoke in the aircraft's cabin. Because petitioner's policies permitted smoking on international flights, petitioner contends that Dr. Hanson's death resulted from his own internal reaction--namely, an asthma attack--to the normal operation of the aircraft. Petitioner also argues that the flight attendant's failure to move Dr. Hanson was inaction, whereas Article 17 requires an action that causes the injury. 

 We disagree.  As an initial matter, we note that petitioner did not challenge in the Court of Appeals the District Court's finding that the flight attendant's conduct in three times refusing to move Dr. Hanson was unusual or unexpected in light of the relevant industry standard or petitioner's own company policy.  116 F. Supp. 2d, at 1133.  Petitioner instead argued that the flight attendant's conduct was irrelevant for purposes of the "accident" inquiry and that the only relevant event was the presence of the ambient cigarette  smoke in the aircraft's cabin. Consequently, we need not dispositively determine whether the flight attendant's conduct qualified as "unusual or unexpected" under Saks, but may assume that it was for purposes of this opinion. 

 Petitioner's focus on the ambient cigarette smoke as the injury producing event is misplaced.  We do not doubt that the presence of ambient cigarette smoke in the aircraft's cabin during an international flight might have been "normal" at the time of the flight in question.  But petitioner's "injury producing event" inquiry--which looks to "the precise factual 'event' that caused the injury"--neglects the reality that there are often multiple interrelated factual events that combine to cause any given injury.  Brief for Petitioner 14.  In Saks, the Court recognized that any one of these factual events or happenings may be a link in the chain of causes and--so long as it is unusual or unexpected--could constitute an "accident" under Article 17.  470 U.S., at 406, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  Indeed, the very fact that multiple events will necessarily combine and interrelate to cause any particular injury makes it difficult to define, in any coherent or non-question-begging way, any single event as the "injury producing event." 

Petitioner's only claim to the contrary here is to say: "Looking to the purely factual description of relevant events, the aggravating event was Dr. Hanson remaining in his assigned non-smoking seat and being exposed to ambient smoke, which allegedly aggravated his pre-existing asthmatic condition leading to his death," Brief for Petitioner 24, and that the "injury producing event" was "not the flight attendant's failure to act or violation of industry standards," Reply Brief for Petitioner 9-10.  Petitioner ignores the fact that the flight attendant's refusal on three separate occasions to move Dr. Hanson was also a "factual 'event,'" Brief for Petitioner 14, that the District  Court correctly found to be a "'link in the chain'" of causes that led to Dr. Hanson's death.  116 F. Supp. 2d, at 1135.  Petitioner's statement that the flight attendant's failure to reseat Dr. Hanson was not the  "injury producing event" is nothing more than a bald assertion, unsupported by any law or argument. 

 An example illustrates why petitioner's emphasis on the ambient cigarette smoke as the "injury producing event" is misplaced.  Suppose that petitioner mistakenly assigns respondent and her husband to seats in the middle of the smoking section, and that respondent and her husband do not notice that they are in the smoking section until after the flight has departed.  Suppose further that, as here, the flight attendant refused to assist respondent and her husband despite repeated requests to move.  In this hypothetical case, it would appear that, "[l]ooking to the purely factual description of relevant events, the aggravating event was [the passenger] remaining in his assigned . . . seat and being exposed to ambient smoke, which allegedly aggravated his pre-existing asthmatic condition leading to his death." Brief for Petitioner 24.  To argue otherwise, petitioner would have to suggest that the misassignment to the smoking section was the "injury producing event," but this would simply beg the question.  The fact is, the exposure to smoke, the misassignment to the smoking section, and the refusal to move the passenger would all be factual events contributing to the death of the passenger.  In the instant case, the same can be said: The exposure to the smoke and the refusal to assist the passenger are happenings that both contributed to the passenger's death. 

 And petitioner's argument that the flight attendant's failure to act cannot constitute an "accident" because only affirmative acts are "event[s] or happening[s]" under Saks is unavailing.  470 U.S., at 405, 84 L. Ed. 2d 289, 105 S. Ct. 1338.  The distinction between action and inaction, as petitioner uses these terms, would perhaps be relevant were this a tort law negligence case.  But respondents do not advocate, and petitioner vigorously rejects, that a negligence regime applies under Article 17 of the Convention.  The relevant "accident" inquiry under Saks is whether there is "an unexpected or unusual event or happening." Ibid. (emphasis added).  The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an "event" or "happening" under the ordinary and usual definitions of these terms.  See American Heritage Dictionary 635 (3d ed. 1992) ("event": "[s]omething that takes place; an occurrence"); Black's Law Dictionary 554-555 (6th ed. 1990) ("event": "Something that happens"); Webster's New International Dictionary 885 (2d ed.  1957) ("event": "The fact of taking place or occurring; occurrence" or "[t]hat which comes, arrives, or happens"). 9 The dissent cites two cases from our sister signatories United Kingdom and Australia--Deep Vein Thrombosis and Air Travel Group Litigation, [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, 2003 WL 21353471, *650 (July 3, 2003), and Qantas Ltd. v Povey, [2003] VSCA 227, P 17, 2003 WL 23000692, P 17 (Dec. 23, 2003) (Ormiston, J. A.), respectively--and suggests that we should simply defer to their judgment on the matter.  But our conclusion is not inconsistent with Deep Vein Thrombosis and Air Travel Group Litigation, where the United Kingdom Court of Appeals commented on the District Court and Court of Appeals opinions in this case, and agreed that Dr. Hanson's death had resulted from an accident.  The United Kingdom court reasoned: "The refusal of the flight attendant to move Dr. Hanson cannot properly be considered as mere inertia, or a non-event.  It was a refusal to provide an alternative seat which formed part of a more complex incident, whereby Dr. Hanson was exposed to smoke in circumstances that can properly be described as unusual and unexpected." EWCA Civ. 1005, P 50, 2003 WL 21353471, at *664, P 50. To the extent that the precise reasoning used by the courts in Deep Vein Thrombosis and Air Travel Group Litigation and Povey is inconsistent with our reasoning, we reject the analysis of those cases for the reasons stated in the body of this opinion.  In such a circumstance, we are hesitant to "follo[w]" the opinions of intermediate appellate courts of our sister signatories, post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1160 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  This is especially true where there are substantial factual distinctions between these cases, see EWCA Civ. 1005, P 29, 2003 WL 21353471, at *659, P 29 (confronting allegations of a "failure to warn of the risk of [deep-vein thrombosis], or to advise on precautions which would avoid or minimize that risk"); VSCA 227, P 3, 2003 WL 23000692, P 3 (noting plaintiff alleged a failure to provide "any information or warning about the risk of [deep-vein thrombosis] or of any measures to reduce the risk"), and where the respective courts of last resort--the House of Lords and High Court of Australia--have yet to speak.

 Moreover, the fallacy of petitioner's  position that an "accident" cannot take the form of inaction is illustrated by the following example.  Suppose that a passenger on a flight inexplicably collapses and stops breathing and that a medical doctor informs the flight crew that the passenger's life could be saved only if the plane lands within one hour.  Suppose further that it is industry standard and airline policy to divert a flight to the nearest airport when a passenger otherwise faces imminent death.  If the plane is within 30 minutes of a suitable airport, but the crew chooses to continue its cross-country flight, "[t]he notion that this is not an unusual event is staggering." McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 159 F. Supp. 2d 562, 574 (SD Tex. 2001). 10 We do not suggest--as the dissent erroneously contends--that liability must lie because otherwise "harsh results," post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1160 (Scalia, J., dissenting), would ensue.  This hypothetical merely illustrates that the failure of an airline crew to take certain necessary vital steps could quite naturally and, in routine usage of the language, be an "event or happening."

 Confirming this interpretation, other provisions of the Convention suggest that there is often no distinction between action and inaction on the issue of ultimate liability.  For example, Article 25 provides that Article 22's liability cap does not apply in the event of "wilful misconduct or . . . such default on [the carrier's] part as, in accordance with the law of the court to which the case is submitted, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct." 49 Stat. 3020 (emphasis added). 11The Montreal Protocol No. 4 to Amend the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air (1975) amends Article 25 by replacing "wilful misconduct" with the language "done with intent to cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably result," as long as the airline's employee or agent was acting "within the scope of his employment." S. Exec. Rep. No. 105-20, p 29 (1998).  In 1998, the United States gave its advice and consent to ratification of the protocol, and it entered into force in the United States on March 4, 1999.  See El Al Israel Airlines, Ltd. v. Tsui Yuan Tseng, 525 U.S. 155, 174, n. 14, 142 L. Ed. 2d 576, 119 S. Ct. 662 (1999).  Because the facts here took place in 1997-1998, Montreal Protocol No. 4 does not apply. Because liability can be imposed for death  or bodily injury only in the case of an Article 17 "accident" and Article 25 only lifts the caps once liability has been found, these provisions read together tend to show that inaction can give rise to liability.  Moreover, Article 20(1) makes clear  that the "due care" defense is unavailable when a carrier has failed to take "all necessary measures to avoid the damage." Id., at 3019.  These provisions suggest that an air carrier's inaction can be the basis for liability. 

 Finally, petitioner contends that the Ninth Circuit improperly created a negligence-based "accident" standard under Article 17 by focusing on the flight crew's negligence as the "accident." The Ninth Circuit stated: "The failure to act in the face of a known, serious risk satisfies the meaning of 'accident' within Article 17 so long as reasonable alternatives exist that would substantially minimize the risk and implementing these alternatives would not unreasonably interfere with the normal, expected operation of the airplane." 316 F.3d at 837.  Admittedly, this language does seem to approve of a negligence-based approach.  However, no party disputes the Ninth Circuit's holding that the flight attendant's conduct was "unexpected and unusual," ibid., which is the operative language under Saks and the correct Article 17 analysis. 

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the conduct here constitutes an "accident" under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 

It is so ordered. 

Justice Breyer took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Petitioner Delma Banks, Jr., was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.  Prior to trial, the State advised  Banks's attorney there would be no need to litigate discovery issues, representing: "[W]e will, without the necessity of motions[,] provide you with all discovery to which you are entitled." App. 361, n 1; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4 (both sources' internal quotation marks omitted).  Despite that undertaking, the State withheld evidence  that would have allowed Banks to discredit two essential prosecution witnesses.  The State did not disclose that one of those witnesses was a paid police informant, nor did it disclose a pretrial transcript revealing that the other witness' trial testimony had been intensively coached by prosecutors and law enforcement officers. 

Furthermore, the prosecution raised no red flag when the informant testified, untruthfully, that he never gave the police any statement and, indeed, had not talked to any police officer about the case until a few days before the trial.  Instead of correcting the informant's false statements, the prosecutor told the jury that the witness "ha[d] been open and honest with you in every way," App. 140, and that his testimony was of the "utmost significance," id., at 146.  Similarly, the prosecution allowed the other key witness to convey, untruthfully, that his testimony was entirely unrehearsed.  Through direct appeal and state collateral review proceedings, the State continued to hold secret the key witnesses' links to the police and allowed their false statements to stand uncorrected. 

 Ultimately, through discovery and an evidentiary hearing authorized in a federal habeas corpus proceeding, the long-suppressed evidence came to light.  The District Court granted Banks relief from the death penalty, but the Court of Appeals reversed.  In the latter court's judgment, Banks had documented his claims of prosecutorial misconduct too late and in the wrong forum; therefore he did not qualify for federal-court relief.  We reverse that judgment.  When police or prosecutors conceal significant exculpatory or impeaching  material in the State's possession, it is ordinarily incumbent on the State to set the record straight. 

I 

On April 14, 1980, police found the corpse of 16-year-old Richard Whitehead in Pocket Park, east of Nash, Texas, a town in the vicinity of Texarkana.  Id., at 8, 141. 1Although a police officer testified Whitehead's body was found on April 14, App. 8, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stated the body was discovered on April 15.  Banks v. State, 643 S.W.2d 129, 131 (1982) (en banc). A preliminary autopsy revealed that Whitehead had been shot three times. Id., at 10.  Bowie County Deputy Sheriff Willie Huff, lead investigator of the death, learned from two witnesses that Whitehead had been in the company of petitioner, 21-year-old Delma Banks, Jr., late on the evening of April 11.  Id., at 11-15, 144;Banks v. State, 643 S.W.2d 129, 131 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982) (en banc), cert denied, 464 U.S. 904, 78 L. Ed. 2d 244, 104 S. Ct. 259 (1983).  On April 23, Huff received a call from a confidential informant reporting that "Banks was coming to Dallas to meet an individual and get a weapon." App. 15.  That evening, Huff and other officers followed Banks to South Dallas, where Banks visited a residence.  Ibid.; Brief for Petitioner 3.  Police stopped Banks's vehicle en route from Dallas, found a handgun in the car, and arrested the car's occupants.  App. 16.  Returning to the Dallas residence Banks had visited, Huff encountered and interviewed Charles Cook and recovered a second gun, a weapon Cook said Banks had left with him several days earlier.  Ibid. Tests later  identified the second gun as the Whitehead murder weapon. Id., at 17. 

In a May 21, 1980, pretrial hearing, Banks's counsel sought information from Huff concerning the confidential informant who told Huff that Banks would be driving to Dallas.  Id., at 21.  Huff was unresponsive.  Ibid. Any information that might reveal the identity of the informant, the prosecution  urged, was privileged.  Id., at 23.  The trial court sustained the State's objection.  Id., at 24.  Several weeks later, in a July 7, 1980, letter, the prosecution advised Banks's counsel that "[the State] will, without necessity of motions provide you with all discovery to which you are entitled." Id., at 361, n 1; App. to Pet. for Cert. A4 (both sources'  internal quotation marks omitted). 

The guilt phase of Banks's trial spanned two days in September 1980.  See Brief for Petitioner 2; App. to Pet. for Cert. C3.  Witnesses testified to seeing Banks and Whitehead together on April 11 in Whitehead's green Mustang, and to hearing gunshots in Pocket Park at 4 a.m. on April 12.  Banks v. State, 643 S. W. 2d, at 131.  Charles Cook testified that Banks arrived in Dallas in a green Mustang at about 8:15 a.m. on April 12, and stayed with Cook until April 14.  App. 42-43, 47-53.  Cook gave the following account of Banks's visit.  On the morning of his arrival, Banks had blood on his leg and told Cook "he [had] got into it on the highway with a white boy." Id., at 44.  That night, Banks confessed to having "kill[ed] the white boy for the hell of it and take[n] his car and come to Dallas." Id., at 48.  During their ensuing conversation, Cook first noticed that "[Banks] had a pistol." Id., at 49.  Two days later, Banks left Dallas by bus.  Id., at 52-53.  The next day, Cook abandoned the Mustang in West Dallas and sold Banks's gun to a neighbor.  Id., at 54.  Cook further testified that, shortly before the police arrived at his residence to question him, Banks had revisited him and requested the gun. Id., at 57. 

On cross-examination, Cook three times represented that he had not talked to anyone about his testimony.  Id., at 59.  In fact, however, Cook had at least one "pretrial practice sessio[n]" at which Huff and prosecutors intensively coached Cook for his appearance on the stand at Banks's trial.  Id., at 325, P 10, 381-390; Joint Lodging Material 1-36 (transcript of pretrial preparatory session).  The prosecution allowed Cook's misstatements to stand uncorrected.  In its guilt-  phase summation, the prosecution told the jury "Cook brought you absolute truth." App. 84. 

In addition to Cook, Robert Farr was a key witness for the prosecution.  Corroborating parts of Cook's account, Farr testified to traveling to Dallas with Banks to retrieve Banks's gun. Id., at 34-35.  On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Farr whether he had "ever taken any money from some police officers," or "give[n] any police officers a statement." Id., at 37-38.  Farr answered no to both questions;  he asserted emphatically that police officers had not promised him anything and that he had "talked to no one about this [case]" until a few days before trial.  Ibid. These answers were untrue, but the State did not correct them.  Farr was the paid informant who told Deputy Sheriff Huff that Banks would travel to Dallas in search of a gun. Id., at 329; App. to Pet. for Cert.  A4, A9.  In a 1999 affidavit, Farr explained: "I assumed that if I did not help [Huff] with his investigation of Delma that he would have me arrested for drug charges.  That's why I agreed to help [Huff].  I was afraid that if I didn't help him, I would be arrested.  . . . "Willie Huff asked me to help him find Delma's gun. I told [Huff] that he would have to pay me money right away for my help on the case.  I think altogether he gave me about $200.00 for helping him.  He paid me some of the money before I set Delma up.  He paid me the rest after Delma was arrested and charged with murder.  . . . "In order to help Willie Huff, I had to set Delma up.  I told Delma that I wanted to rob a pharmacy to get drugs and that I needed his gun to do it.  I did not really plan to commit a robbery but I told Delma this so that he would give me his gun. . . .  I convinced Delma to drive to Dallas with me to get the gun." App. 442-443, PP 6-8. 

 The defense presented no evidence.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A6.  Banks was convicted of murder committed in the course of a robbery, in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 19.03(a)(2) (1974).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. C3. 2"A person commits an offense if he commits murder . . . and . . . the person intentionally commits the murder in the course of committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, burglary, robbery, aggravated rape, or arson." Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 19.03(a)(2) (1974).

The penalty phase ran its course the next day.  Ibid. Governed by the Texas statutory capital murder scheme applicable in 1980, the jury decided Banks's sentence by answering three "special issues." App. 142-143. 3As set forth in Texas law, the three special issues were: "(1) whether the conduct of the defendant that caused the death of the deceased was committed deliberately and with the reasonable expectation that the death of the deceased or another would result; "(2) whether there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and "(3) if raised by the evidence, whether the conduct of the defendant in killing the deceased was unreasonable in response to the provocation, if any, by the deceased." Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 37.071(b)(1)-(3) (Vernon Supp. 1980). "If the jury unanimously answer[ed] 'yes' to each issue submitted, the trial court [would be obliged to] sentence the defendant to death." Penry v. Lynaugh,492 U.S. 302, 310, 106 L. Ed. 2d 256, 109 S. Ct. 2934 (1989) (construing Texas' sentencing scheme); Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 37.071(c)-(e) (Vernon Supp. 1980).  The critical question at the penalty phase in Banks's case was: "Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant, Delma Banks, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?" App. 143 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

On this question, the State offered two witnesses,  Vetrano Jefferson and Robert Farr.  Id., at 104-113.  Jefferson testified that, in early April 1980, Banks had struck him across  the face with a gun and threatened to kill him.  Id., at 104-106.  Farr's testimony focused once more on the trip to Dallas to fetch Banks's gun. The gun was needed, Farr asserted, because "[w]e [Farr and Banks] were going to pull some robberies." Id., at  108.  According to Farr, Banks "said he would take care of it" if "there was any trouble during these burglaries." Id., at 109.  When the prosecution asked: "How did [Banks] say he would take care of it?", Farr responded: "[Banks] didn't go into any specifics, but he said it would be taken care of." Ibid.

On cross-examination, defense counsel twice asked whether Farr had told Deputy Sheriff Huff of the Dallas trip.  Ibid. The State remained silent as Farr twice perjuriously testified: "No, I did not." Ibid. Banks's counsel also inquired whether Farr had previously attempted to obtain prescription drugs by fraud, and, "up tight over that," would "testify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear." Id., at 110.  Farr first responded: "Can you prove it?" Ibid. Instructed by the court to answer defense counsel's questions, Farr again said: "No, I did not . . . ." Ibid.

Two defense witnesses impeached Farr, but were, in turn, impeached themselves.  James Kelley testified to Farr's attempts to obtain drugs by fraud; the prosecution impeached Kelley by eliciting his close relationship to Banks's girlfriend.  Id., at 124-129.  Later, Kelley admitted to being drunk while on the stand.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A13.  Former Arkansas police officer Gary Owen testified that Farr, as a police informant in Arkansas, had given false information; the prosecution impeached Owen by bringing out his pending application for employment by defense counsel's private investigator.  App. 129-131. 

Banks's parents and acquaintances testified that Banks was a "respectful, churchgoing young man." App. to Pet. for Cert. A7; App. 137-139.  Thereafter, Banks took the stand.  He affirmed that he "[h]ad never before been convicted  of a felony." Id., at 134. 4Banks, in fact, had no criminal record at all.  App. 255, P 115; App. to Pet. for Cert. C23.  He also "had no history of violence or alcohol abuse and seemed to possess a self-control that would suggest no particular risk of future violence." Ibid. Banks admitted striking Vetrano Jefferson in April 1980, and traveling to Dallas to obtain a gun in late April 1980.  Id., at 134-136.  He denied, however, any intent to participate in robberies, asserting that Farr alone had planned to commit them.  Id., at 136-137.  The prosecution suggested on cross-examination that Banks had been willing "to supply [Farr] the means and possible death weapon in an armed robbery case." Id., at 137.  Banks conceded as much.  Ibid.

During summation, the prosecution intimated that Banks had not been wholly truthful in this regard, suggesting that "a man doesn't travel two hundred miles, or whatever the distance is from here [Texarkana] to Dallas, Texas, to supply a person with a weapon." Id., at 143.  The State homed in on Farr's testimony that Banks said he would "take care" of any trouble arising during the robbery: "[Farr] said, 'Man, you know, what i[f] there's trouble?' And [Banks] says, 'Don't worry about it.  I'll take care of it.' I think that speaks for itself, and I think you know what that means.  . . .  I submit to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the State has again met its burden of proof, and that the answer to question number two [propensity to commit violent criminal acts]  should also be yes." Id., at 140, 144.  See also id., at 146-147.

Urging Farr's credibility, the prosecution called the jury's attention to Farr's admission, at trial, that he used narcotics. Id., at 36, 140.  Just as Farr had been truthful about his drug use, the prosecution suggested, he was also "open and honest with [the jury] in every way" in his penalty-phase testimony.  Id., at 140.  Farr's testimony, the prosecution emphasized, was "of the utmost significance" because it  showed "[Banks] is a danger to friends and strangers, alike." Id., at 146.  Banks's effort to impeach Farr was ineffective, the prosecution further urged, because defense witness "Kelley kn[ew] nothing about the murder," and defense witness Owen "wish[ed] to please his future employers." Id., at 148. 

The jury answered yes to the three special issues, and the judge sentenced Banks to death.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Banks's direct appeal.  643 S.W. 2d, at 135.  Banks's first two state postconviction motions raised issues not implicated here; both were denied. Ex parte Banks, No. 13568-01 (Tex Crim App 1984); Ex parte Banks, 769 S.W.2d 539, 540 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). 

Banks's third state postconviction motion, filed January 13, 1992, presented questions later advanced in federal court and reiterated in the petition now before us.  App. 150.  Banks alleged "upon information and belief" that "the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence as required by [Brady v. Maryland,373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963)]"; 5Brady v. Maryland,373 U.S. 83, 87, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963), held that "the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution." the withheld evidence, Banks asserted, "would have revealed Robert Farr as a police informant and Mr. Banks' arrest as a set-up." App. 180, P 114 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In support of this third state-court postconviction plea, Banks attached an unsigned affidavit from his girlfriend, Farr's sister-in-law Demetra Jefferson, which stated that Farr "was well-connected to law enforcement people," and consequently managed to stay out of "trouble" for illegally obtaining prescription drugs. Id., at 195,  P 7.  Banks alleged as well that during the guilt phase of his trial, the State deliberately withheld information "critical to the jury's assessment of Cook's credibility," including the "generous 'deal' [Cook had] cut with the prosecutors." Id., at 152, P 2, 180, P 114. 6Banks also alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at both the guilt and penalty phases; insufficient evidence on the second penalty-phase special issue (Banks's propensity to commit violent criminal acts); and the exclusion of minority jurors in violation of Swain v. Alabama,380 U.S. 202, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct. 824 (1965).  App. to Pet. for Cert. C5-C7.  Banks filed two further state postconviction motions; both were denied.  Brief for Respondent 6-7, nn 6 and 7 (citing Ex parte Banks, No. 13568-03 (Tex Crim App 1993) (per curiam), and Ex parte Banks, No. 13568-06 (Tex Crim App), cert denied, 538 US 990, 538 U.S. 990, 155 L. Ed. 2d 688, 123 S. Ct. 1810(2003)).

 The State's reply to Banks's pleading, filed October 6, 1992, "denie[d] each and every allegation of fact made by [Banks] except those supported by official court records and those specifically admitted." Id., at 234; Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.  "[N]othing was kept secret from the defense,"  the State represented.  App. 234.  While the reply specifically asserted that the State had made "no deal with Cook," ibid., the State said nothing specific about Farr.  Affidavits from Deputy Sheriff Huff and prosecutors accompanied the reply.  Id., at 241-243.  The affiants denied any "deal, secret or otherwise, with Charles Cook," but they, too, like the State's pleading they supported, remained silent about Farr.  Ibid.

In February and July 1993 orders, the state postconviction court rejected Banks's claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. E1-E10, G1-G7.  The court found that "there was no agreement between the State and the witness Charles Cook," but made no findings concerning Farr.  Id., at G2.  In a January 10, 1996, one-page per curiam order, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the lower court's disposition of Banks's motion.  Id., at D1. 

 On March 7, 1996, Banks filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  App. 248.  He alleged multiple violations of his federal constitutional rights.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C5-C7.  Relevant here, Banks reasserted that the State had withheld material exculpatory evidence  "reveal[ing] Robert Farr as a police informant and Mr. Banks' arrest as a set-up." App. 260, P 152 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Banks also asserted that the State had concealed "Cook's enormous incentive to testify in a manner favorable to the [prosecution]." Id., at 260, P 153; App. to Pet. for Cert. C6-C7. 7We hereinafter refer to these claims as the Farr Brady and Cook Brady claims respectively.  See supra, at ____, n 5, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184. In June 1998, Banks moved for discovery and an evidentiary hearing to gain information from the State on the roles played and trial testimony provided by Farr and Cook.  App. 262-266, 282-283, 286.  The superintending Magistrate Judge allowed limited discovery regarding Cook, but found insufficient justification for inquiries concerning Farr.  Id., at 294-295. 

 Banks renewed his discovery and evidentiary hearing requests in February 1999.  Id., at 2, 300-331.  This time, he proffered affidavits from both Farr and Cook to back up his claims that, as to each of these two key witnesses, the prosecution had wrongly withheld crucial exculpatory and impeaching evidence.  Id., at 322-331.  Farr's affidavit affirmed that Farr had "set Delma up" by proposing the drive to Dallas and informing Deputy Sheriff Huff of the trip.  Id., at 329, P 8, 442-443, P 8; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1182.  Accounting for his unavailability earlier, Farr stated that less than a year after the Banks trial, he had left Texarkana, first for Oklahoma, then for California, because his police-informant work endangered his life.  App. 330-331, 444; Pet. for Cert. 27, n 12.  Cook recalled that in preparation for his Banks trial testimony, he had participated in "three or four . . . practice sessions" at which prosecutors told him to testify "as they wanted [him] to, and that [he] would spend the rest of [his] life in prison if [he] did not." App. 325, PP 10-11. 

On March 4, 1999, the Magistrate Judge issued an order establishing issues for an evidentiary hearing, id., at 340,  346, at which she would consider Banks's claims that the State had withheld "crucial exculpatory  and impeaching evidence"  concerning "two of the [S]tate's essential witnesses, Charles Cook and Robert Farr," id., at 340, 345 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In anticipation of the hearing, the Magistrate Judge ordered disclosure of the Bowie County District Attorney's files.  Brief for Petitioner 37-38; Tr. of June 7-8, 1999, Federal Evidentiary Hearing (ED Tex), p 30 (hereinafter Federal Evidentiary Hearing). 

One item lodged in the District Attorney's files, turned over to Banks pursuant to the Magistrate Judge's disclosure order, was a 74-page transcript of a Cook interrogation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A10.  The interrogation, conducted by Bowie County law enforcement officials and prosecutors, occurred in September 1980, shortly before the Banks trial.  Ibid. The transcript revealed that the State's representatives had closely rehearsed Cook's testimony.  In particular, the officials told Cook how to reconcile his testimony with affidavits to which he had earlier subscribed recounting Banks's visits to Dallas.  See, e.g., Joint Lodging Material 24 ("Your [April 1980] statement is obviously screwed up."); id., at 26 ("[T]he way this statement should read is that . . . ."); id., at 32 ("[L]et me tell you how this is going to work."); id., at 36 ("That's not in your [earlier] statement.").  Although the transcript did not bear on Banks's claim that the prosecution had a deal with Cook, it provided compelling evidence that Cook's testimony had been tutored by Banks's prosecutors. Without objection at the hearing, the Magistrate Judge admitted the September 1980 transcript into evidence.  Brief for Petitioner 39; Federal Evidentiary Hearing 75-76. 

Testifying at the evidentiary hearing, Deputy Sheriff Huff acknowledged, for the first time, that Farr was an informant and that he had been paid $200 for his involvement in the case.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C43.  As to Cook, a Banks trial prosecutor testified, in line with the State's consistent position, that no deal had been offered to gain Cook's trial testimony. Id., at C45; Federal Evidentiary Hearing 52-53.   Defense counsel questioned the prosecutor about the September 1980 transcript, calling attention to discrepancies between the transcript and Cook's statements at trial.  Id., at 65-68.  In a posthearing brief and again in proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, Banks emphasized the suppression of the September 1980 transcript, noting the prosecution's obligation to disclose material, exculpatory evidence, and the assurance in this case that Banks would receive "all [the] discovery to which [Banks was] entitled." App. 360-361, and n 1, 378-379 (internal quotation marks omitted); supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1181. 

In a May 11, 2000, report and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommended a writ of habeas corpus with respect to Banks's death sentence, but not his conviction.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C54.  "[T]he State's failure to disclose Farr's informant status, coupled with trial counsel's dismal performance during the punishment phase," the Magistrate Judge concluded, "undermined the reliability of the jury's verdict regarding punishment." Id., at C44.  Finding no convincing evidence of a deal between the State and Cook, however, she recommended that the guilt-phase verdict remain undisturbed.  Id., at C46. 

 Banks moved to alter or amend the Magistrate Judge's report on the ground that it left unresolved a fully aired question, i.e., whether Banks's rights were violated by the State's failure to disclose to the defense the prosecution's eve-of-trial interrogation of Cook.  App. 398.  That interrogation, Banks observed, could not be reconciled with Cook's insistence at trial that he had talked to no one about his testimony.  Id., at 400, n 17; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1181. 

The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and denied Banks's motion to amend the report.  App. to Pet. for Cert. B6; App. 421-424.  Concerning the Cook Brady transcript-suppression claim, the District Court recognized that Banks had filed his federal petition in 1996, three years before he became aware of the September 1980 transcript.  App. 422-423.  When the transcript surfaced in response to the Magistrate Judge's 1999 disclosure order, Banks raised that newly discovered, long withheld document in his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and, again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge's report.  Id., at 423.  The District Court concluded, however, that Banks had not properly pleaded a Brady claim predicated on the withheld Cook rehearsal transcript.  App. 422.  When that Brady claim came to light, the District Court reasoned, Banks should have moved to amend or supplement his 1996 federal habeas petition specifically to include the 1999 discovery as a basis for relief.  App. 423.  Banks urged that a Brady claim based on the September 1980 transcript had been aired by implied consent; under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), he contended, the claim should have been treated as if raised in the pleadings.  App. 433. 8Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) provides:  "When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.  Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time . . . ." Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts provides that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply "to the extent that they are not inconsistent with [habeas] rules." Banks sought, and the District Court denied, a certificate of appealability on this question.  Id., at 433, 436. 

 In an August 20, 2003, unpublished per curiam opinion, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the judgment of the District Court to the extent that it granted relief on the Farr Brady claim and denied a certificate of appealability on the Cook Brady claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A2, Judgt. order reported at 48 Fed. Appx. 104 (2002). 9 The Fifth Circuit noted correctly that under Lindh v. Murphy,521 U.S. 320, 336-337, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, 117 S. Ct. 2059 (1997), the standards of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, do not apply to Banks's petition.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A14-A15. The  Court of Appeals observed that in his 1992 state-court postconviction application, Banks had not endeavored to develop the facts underpinning the Farr Brady claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A19-A20.  For that reason, the court held, the evidentiary proceeding ordered by the Magistrate Judge was unwarranted.  Ibid.The Court of Appeals expressed no doubt that the prosecution had suppressed, prior to the federal habeas proceeding, Farr's informant status  and his part in the fateful trip to Dallas.  But Banks was not appropriately diligent in pursuing his state-court application, the Court of Appeals maintained.  In the Fifth Circuit's view, Banks should have at that time attempted to locate Farr and question him; similarly, he should have asked to interview Deputy Sheriff Huff and other officers involved in investigating the crime. Id., at A19, A22.  If such efforts had proved unavailing, the Court of Appeals suggested, Banks might have applied to the state court for assistance.  Id., at A19.  Banks's lack of diligence in pursuing his 1992 state-court plea, the Court of Appeals concluded, rendered the evidence uncovered in the federal habeas proceeding procedurally barred.  Id., at A22-A23. 

In any event, the Fifth Circuit further concluded, Farr's status as an informant was not "materia[l]" for Brady purposes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A32-A33.  Banks had impeached Farr at trial by bringing out that he had been a police informant in Arkansas, and an unreliable one at that.  Id., at A28, A32-A33; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1183.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals said, other witnesses had corroborated much of Farr's testimony against Banks.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A32.  Notably, Banks himself had acknowledged his willingness to get a gun for Farr's use in robberies. Ibid. In addition, the Fifth Circuit observed, the Magistrate Judge had relied on the cumulative effect of Brady error and the ineffectiveness of Banks's counsel at the penalty phase. App. to Pet. for Cert. A44.  Banks himself, however, had not urged that position; he had argued Brady and ineffective assistance of  counsel discretely, not cumulatively.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A46-A47.  Finally, in accord with the District Court, the Court of Appeals apparently regarded Rule 15(b) as inapplicable in habeas proceedings.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A51-A52.  The Fifth Circuit accordingly denied a certificate of appealability on the Cook Brady transcript-suppression claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A52, A78. 

 With an execution date set for March 12, 2003, Banks applied to this Court for a writ of certiorari, presenting four issues: the tenability of his Farr Brady claim; a penalty-phase ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim; the question whether, as to the Cook Brady transcript-suppression claim, a certificate of appealability was wrongly denied; and a claim of improper exclusion of minority jurors in violation of Swain v. Alabama,380 U.S. 202, 13 L. Ed. 2d 759, 85 S. Ct. 824 (1965).  Pet. for Cert. 23-24.  We stayed Banks's execution on March 12, 2003, and, on April 21, 2003, granted his petition on all questions other than his Swain claim.  538 U.S. 977, 155 L. Ed. 2d 665, 123 S. Ct. 1784 (2003).  We now reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment dismissing Banks's Farr Brady claim and that Court's denial of a certificate of appealability on his Cook Brady claim. 10 Our disposition of the Farr Brady claim, and our conclusion that a writ of habeas corpus should issue with respect to the death sentence, render it unnecessary to address Banks's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase; any relief he could obtain on that claim would be cumulative.

II 

 We note, initially, that Banks's Brady claims arose under the  regime in place prior to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat 1214.  Turning to the tenability of those claims, we consider first Banks's Farr Brady claim as it trains on his death sentence, see App. to Pet. for Cert. B6 (District Court granted habeas solely with respect to the capital sentence), and next, Banks's Cook Brady claim. 

 A 

 To pursue habeas corpus relief in federal court, Banks first had to exhaust "the remedies available in the courts of the State." 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b) [28 USCS § 2254(b)] (1994 ed.); see Rose v. Lundy,455 U.S. 509, 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982).  Banks alleged in his January 1992 state-court application for a writ of habeas corpus that the prosecution knowingly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence involving Farr in violation of Banks's due process rights.  App. 180.  Banks thus satisfied the exhaustion requirement as to the legal ground for his Farr Brady claim. 11Banks's federal habeas petition, the Court of Appeals said, stated a claim, only under Brady, that material exculpatory or impeachment evidence had been suppressed, not a claim under Napue v. Illinois,360 U.S. 264, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217, 79 S. Ct. 1173 (1959), and Giglio v. United States,405 U.S. 150, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972), that the prosecution had failed to correct Farr's false testimony.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A29-A32; App. 259-260.  In its view, the Court of Appeals explained, a Brady claim is distinct from a Giglio claim, App. to Pet. for Cert. A30; thus the two did not fit under one umbrella.  But cf. United States v. Bagley,473 U.S. 667, 679-680, n. 8, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 105 S. Ct. 3375 (1985); United States v. Agurs,427 U.S. 97, 103-104, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342, 96 S. Ct. 2392 (1976).  On brief, the parties debate the issue.  Brief for Petitioner 23-25; Brief for Respondent 21-22, n 21.  Because we conclude that Banks qualifies for relief under Brady, we need not decide whether a Giglio claim, to warrant adjudication, must be separately pleaded.

 In state postconviction court, however, Banks failed to produce evidence establishing that Farr had served as a police informant in this case.  As support for his Farr Brady claim, Banks appended to his state-court application only Demetra Jefferson's hardly probative statement that Farr "was well-connected to law enforcement people." App. 195, P 7; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184.  In the federal habeas forum, therefore, it was incumbent on Banks to show that he was not barred, by reason of the anterior state proceedings, from producing evidence to substantiate his Farr Brady claim.  Banks "[would be] entitled to an evidentiary hearing [in federal court] if he [could] show cause for his failure to develop the  facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure." Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes,504 U.S. 1, 11, 118 L. Ed. 2d 318, 112 S. Ct. 1715 (1992). 

Brady, we reiterate, held that "the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution." 373 U.S. 83 at 87, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194.  We set out in Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-282, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (1999), the three components or essential elements of a Brady prosecutorial misconduct claim: "The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully  or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued." 527 U.S. 263 at 281-282, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  "[C]ause and prejudice" in this case "parallel two of the three components of the alleged Brady violation itself." Id., 527 U.S. at 282, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Corresponding to the second Brady component (evidence suppressed by the State), a petitioner shows "cause" when the reason for his failure to develop facts in state-court proceedings was the State's suppression of the relevant evidence; coincident with the third Brady component (prejudice), prejudice within the compass of the "cause and prejudice" requirement exists when the suppressed evidence is "material" for Brady purposes.  527 U.S. 263 at 282, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  As to the first Brady component (evidence favorable to the accused), beyond genuine debate, the suppressed evidence relevant here, Farr's paid informant status, qualifies as evidence advantageous to Banks.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A26 (Court of Appeals' recognition that "Farr's being a paid informant would certainly be favorable to Banks in attacking Farr's testimony").  Thus, if Banks succeeds in demonstrating "cause and prejudice," he will at the same time succeed in establishing the elements of his Farr Brady death penalty due process claim. 

 B 

 Our determination as to "cause" for Banks's failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings is informed by Strickler.12Surprisingly, the Court of Appeals' per curiam opinion did not refer to Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (1999), the controlling precedent on the issue of "cause." App. to Pet. for Cert. A15-A33. In that case, Virginia prosecutors told the petitioner, prior to trial, that "the prosecutor's files were open to the petitioner's counsel," thus "there was no need for a formal [Brady] motion." 527 U.S. 263 at 276, n. 14, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (quoting App. in Strickler v Greene, O. T. 1998, No. 98-5864, pp 212-213 (brackets in original)).  The prosecution file given to the Strickler petitioner, however, did not include several documents prepared by an "importan[t]" prosecution witness, recounting the witness' initial difficulty recalling the events to which she testified at the petitioner's trial.  527 U.S. at 273-275, 290, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Those absent-from-the-file documents could have been used to impeach the witness.  Id., 527 U.S. 263 at 273, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  In state-court postconviction proceedings, the Strickler petitioner had unsuccessfully urged ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel's failure to move, pretrial, for Brady material.  Answering that plea, the State asserted that a Brady motion would have been superfluous, for the prosecution had maintained an open file policy pursuant to which it had disclosed all Brady material.  527 U.S. 263 at 276, n. 14, 278, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936. 

This Court determined that in the federal habeas proceedings, the Strickler petitioner had shown cause for his failure to raise a Brady claim in state court.  527 U.S. 263 at 289, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Three factors accounted for that determination: "(a) the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence; (b) petitioner reasonably relied on the prosecution's  open file policy as fulfilling the prosecution's duty to disclose such evidence; and (c) the [State] confirmed petitioner's reliance on the open file policy by asserting during state  habeas proceedings that petitioner had already received everything known to the government." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). 13We left open the question "whether any one or two of these factors would be sufficient to constitute cause." Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 289, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  We need not decide that question today.

This case is congruent with Strickler in all three respects.  First, the State knew of, but kept back, Farr's arrangement with Deputy Sheriff Huff.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C43; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33; cf. Kyles v. Whitley,514 U.S. 419, 437, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 (1995)(prosecutors are responsible for "any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police").  Second, the State asserted, on the eve of trial, that it would disclose all Brady material.  App. 361, n 1; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1181.  As Strickler instructs, Banks cannot be faulted for relying on that representation.  See 527 U.S. 263 at 283-284, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (an "open file policy" is one factor that "explain[s] why trial counsel did not advance [a Brady] claim"). 

Third, in his January 1992 state habeas application, Banks asserted that Farr was a police informant and Banks's arrest, "a set-up." App. 180, P 114 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In its answer, the State denied Banks's assertion.  Id., at 234; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184.  The State thereby "confirmed" Banks's reliance on the prosecution's representation that it had fully disclosed all relevant information its file contained.  527 U.S. 263 at 289, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936; see id., 527 U.S. 263 at 284, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (state habeas counsel, as well as trial counsel, could reasonably rely on the State's representations).  In short, because the State persisted in hiding Farr's informant status and misleadingly represented that it had complied in full with its Brady disclosure obligations, Banks had cause for failing to investigate, in state postconviction proceedings,  Farr's connections to Deputy Sheriff Huff. 

 On the question of "cause," moreover, Banks's case is stronger than was the petitioner's in Strickler in a notable respect.  As a prosecution witness in the guilt and penalty phases of Banks's trial, Farr repeatedly misrepresented his dealings with police; each time Farr responded untruthfully, the prosecution allowed his testimony to stand uncorrected.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1181-1183.  Farr denied taking money from or being promised anything by police officers, App. 37; he twice denied speaking with police officers, id., at 38, and twice denied informing Deputy Sheriff Huff about Banks's trip to Dallas, id., at 109.  It has long been established that the prosecution's "deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice." Giglio v. United States,405 U.S. 150, 153, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104, 92 S. Ct. 763 (1972) (quoting Mooney v. Holohan,294 U.S. 103, 112, 79 L. Ed. 791, 55 S. Ct. 340 (1935)(per curiam)).  If it was reasonable for Banks to rely on the prosecution's  full disclosure representation, it was also appropriate for Banks to assume that his prosecutors would not stoop to improper litigation conduct to advance prospects for gaining a conviction.  See Berger v. United States,295 U.S. 78, 88, 79 L. Ed. 1314, 55 S. Ct. 629 (1935); Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 284, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286 119 S. Ct. 1936. 14 In addition, Banks could have expected disclosure of Farr's informant status as a matter of state law if Farr in fact acted in that capacity.  Under Texas law applicable at the time of Banks's trial, the State had an obligation to disclose the identity of an informant when "the informant . . . was present at the time of the offense or arrest . . . [or] was otherwise shown to be a material witness to the transaction . . . ." Kemner v. State, 589 S.W.2d 403, 408 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979) (quoting Carmouche v. State, 540 S.W.2d 701, 703 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976)); cf. Tex. Rule Evid. 508(c)(1) (2003) ("No privilege exists [for the identity of an informer] . . . if the informer appears as a witness for the public entity.").  Farr was present when Banks was arrested.  App. 443, P 10.  Further, as the prosecution noted in its penalty-phase summation, Farr's testimony was not only material, but "of the utmost significance." Id., at 146.

 The State presents three main arguments for distinguishing Strickler on the issue of "cause," two of them endorsed  by the Court of Appeals.  Brief for Respondent 15-20; App. to Pet. for Cert. A19, A22-A23; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1187-1188.  We conclude that none of these arguments accounts adequately for the State's concealment and misrepresentation regarding Farr's link to Deputy Sheriff Huff.  The State first suggests that Banks's failure, during state postconviction proceedings, to "attempt to locate Farr and ascertain his true status," or to "interview the investigating officers, such as Deputy Huff, to ascertain Farr's status," undermines a finding of cause; the Fifth Circuit agreed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A22; Brief for Respondent 18-20.  In the State's view, "[t]he question [of cause] revolves around Banks's conduct," particularly his lack of appropriate diligence in pursuing the Farr Brady claim before resorting to federal court.  Brief for Respondent 14. 15The Court of Appeals also stated that, because "the State did not respond" to Banks's "Farr-was-an-informant contention" in its answer to the January 1992 state habeas application, Banks should have "further investigate[d]." App. to Pet. for Cert. A22.  The Fifth Circuit's error in this regard is apparent.  As earlier recounted, see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1191-1192, the State's answer indeed did deny Banks's allegation.

 We rejected a similar argument in Strickler There, the State contended that examination of a witness' trial testimony, alongside a letter the witness published in a local newspaper, should have alerted the petitioner to the existence of undisclosed interviews of the witness by the police.  527 U.S. 263 at 284, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  We found this contention insubstantial.  In light of the State's open file policy, we noted, "it is especially unlikely that counsel would have suspected that additional impeaching evidence was being withheld." Id., 527 U.S. 263 at 285, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Our decisions lend no support to the notion that defendants must scavenge for hints of undisclosed Brady material when the prosecution represents that all such material has been disclosed.  As we observed in Strickler, defense counsel has no "procedural obligation to assert constitutional error on the basis of mere suspicion that some prosecutorial  misstep may have occurred." 527 U.S. 263 at 286-287, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  The "cause" inquiry, we have also observed, turns on events or circumstances "external to the defense."  Amadeo v. Zant,486 U.S. 214, 222, 100 L. Ed. 2d 249, 108 S. Ct. 1771 (1988) (quoting Murray v. Carrier,477 U.S. 478, 488, 91 L. Ed. 2d 397, 106 S. Ct. 2639 (1986)).

 The State here nevertheless urges, in effect, that "the prosecution can lie and conceal and the prisoner still has the burden to . . . discover the evidence," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35, so long as the "potential existence" of a prosecutorial misconduct claim might have been detected, id., at 36.  A rule thus declaring "prosecutor may hide, defendant must seek," is not tenable in a system constitutionally bound to accord defendants due process.  "Ordinarily, we presume that public officials have properly discharged their official duties." Bracy v. Gramley,520 U.S. 899, 909, 138 L. Ed. 2d 97, 117 S. Ct. 1793 (1997) (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc.,272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 71 L. Ed. 131, 47 S. Ct. 1 (1926)).  We have several times underscored the "special role played by the American prosecutor in the search for truth in criminal trials." Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 281, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936; accord Kyles, 514 U.S. 419 at 439-440, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555; United States v. Bagley,473 U.S. 667, 675, n. 6, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 105 S. Ct. 3375 (1985); Berger, 295 U.S. 78 at 88, 79 L. Ed. 1314, 55 S. Ct. 629.  See also Olmstead v. United States,277 U.S. 438, 484, 72 L. Ed. 944, 48 S. Ct. 564 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  Courts, litigants, and juries properly anticipate that "obligations [to refrain from improper methods to secure a conviction] . . . plainly rest[ing] upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed." Berger, 295 U.S. 78 at 88, 79 L. Ed. 1314, 55 S. Ct. 629.  Prosecutors' dishonest conduct or unwarranted concealment should attract no judicial approbation.  See Kyles, 514 U.S. 419 at 440, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 ("The prudence of the careful prosecutor should not . . . be discouraged."). 

 The State's second argument is a variant of the first.  Specifically, the State argues, and the Court of Appeals accepted, that Banks cannot show cause because in the 1992 state-court postconviction proceedings, he failed to move for investigative assistance enabling him to inquire into Farr's  police connections, connections he then alleged, but failed to prove.  Brief for Respondent 15-16; App. to Pet. for Cert. A19; see 1977 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 789, § 1 (as amended) (instructing postconviction court to "designat[e] the issues of fact to be resolved," and giving the court discretion to "order affidavits, depositions, interrogatories, and hearings").  Armed in 1992 only with Demetra Jefferson's declaration that Farr was "well-connected to law enforcement people,"  App. 195, P 7; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184, Banks had little to proffer in support of a request for assistance from the state postconviction court.  We assign no overriding significance to Banks's failure to invoke state-court assistance to which he had no clear entitlement.  Cf. Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 286, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936("Proper respect for state procedures counsels against a requirement that all possible claims be raised in state collateral proceedings, even when no known facts support them."). 16Furthermore, rather than conceding the need for factual development of the Farr Brady claim in state postconviction court, the State asserted that Banks's prosecutorial misconduct claims were meritless and procedurally barred in that tribunal.  App. 234, 240.  Having taken that position in 1992, the State can hardly fault Banks now for failing earlier to request assistance the State certainly would have opposed.

Finally, relying on Roviaro v.  United States,353 U.S. 53, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639, 77 S. Ct. 623 (1957), the State asserts that "disclosure [of an informant's identity] is not automatic," and, "[c]onsequently, it was Banks's duty to move for disclosure of otherwise privileged information." Brief for Respondent 17-18, n 15.  We need not linger over this argument.  The issue of evidentiary law in Roviaro was whether (or when) the Government is obliged to reveal the identity of an undercover informer the Government does not call as a trial witness.  353 U.S. 53 at 55-56, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639, 77 S. Ct. 623.  The Court there stated that no privilege obtains "[w]here the disclosure of an informer's identify, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused." Id., 353 U.S. 53 at 60-61, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639, 77 S. Ct. 623.  Accordingly, even though the informer in Roviaro did not testify, we held that disclosure  of his identity was necessary because he could have "amplif[ied] or contradict[ed] the testimony of government witnesses." Id., 353 U.S. 53 at 64, 1 L. Ed. 2d 639, 77 S. Ct. 623. 

Here, the State elected to call Farr as a witness.  Indeed, he was a key witness at both guilt and punishment phases of Banks's capital trial.  Farr's status as a paid informant was unquestionably "relevant"; similarly beyond doubt, disclosure of Farr's status would have been "helpful to [Banks's] defense." Id., 353 U.S. 53 at 60-61, 1 L. Ed 2d 639, 77 S. Ct. 623.  Nothing in Roviaro, or any other decision of this Court, suggests that the State can examine an informant at trial, withholding acknowledgment of his informant status in the hope that defendant will not catch on, so will make no disclosure motion. 

 In summary, Banks's prosecutors represented at trial and in state postconviction proceedings that the State had held nothing back.  Moreover, in state postconviction court, the State's pleading denied that Farr was an informant. App. 234; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184-1185.  It was not incumbent on Banks to prove these representations false; rather, Banks was entitled to treat the prosecutors' submissions as truthful.  Accordingly, Banks has shown cause for failing to present evidence in state court capable of substantiating his Farr Brady claim.

 Unless suppressed evidence is "material for Brady purposes, [its] suppression [does] not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome [a] procedural default." Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 282, 144 L. Ed. 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Our touchstone on materiality is Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 (1995). Kyles instructed that the materiality standard for Brady claims is met when "the favorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict." 514 U.S. 419 at 435, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555.  See also id., 514 U.S. 419 at 434-435, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 ("A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left  to convict."); accord Strickler, 527 U.S. 263  at 290, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  In short, Banks must show a "reasonable probability of a different result." Kyles, 514 U.S. 419 at 434, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 at 678, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 105 S. Ct. 3375). 

 As the State acknowledged at oral argument, Farr was "paid for a critical role in the scenario that led to the indictment." Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.  Farr's declaration, presented to the federal habeas court, asserts that Farr, not Banks, initiated the proposal to obtain a gun to facilitate the commission of robberies. See App. 442-443, PP 7-8; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1182.  Had Farr not instigated, upon Deputy Sheriff Huff's request, the Dallas excursion to fetch Banks's gun, the prosecution would have had slim, if any, evidence that Banks planned to "continue" committing violent acts.  App. 147. 17It bears reiteration here that Banks had no criminal record, App. 255, P 115, "no history of violence or alcohol abuse," nothing indicative of "[any] particular risk of future violence," App. to Pet. for Cert. C23. It also appears that the remaining prosecution witness in the penalty phase, Vetrano Jefferson, had omitted crucial details from his 1980 testimony.  In his September 1980 testimony, Vetrano Jefferson said that Banks had struck him with a pistol in early April 1980.  App. 104-105; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1182.  In the federal habeas proceeding, Vetrano Jefferson elaborated that he, not Banks, had initiated that incident by making "disrespectful comments" about Demetra Jefferson, Banks's girlfriend.  App. 337, P 4.  Vetrano Jefferson recounted that he "grew angry" when Banks objected to the comments, and only then did a fight ensue, in the course of which Banks struck Vetrano Jefferson.  Ibid. Farr's admission of his instigating role, moreover, would have dampened the prosecution's zeal in urging the jury to bear in mind Banks's "planning and acquisition of a gun to commit robbery," or Banks's "planned violence." Ibid.; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50. 18 On brief and at oral argument, the State suggests that "the damaging evidence was Banks's willing abetment of Farr's commission of a violent crime, not Banks's own intent to commit such an act." Brief for Respondent 25 (emphasis in original); Tr. of Oral Arg. 50.  See also post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1200-1201 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  In the penalty-phase summation, however, the prosecution highlighted Banks's propensity to commit violent criminal acts, see App. 140, 144, 146-147, not his facilitation of others' criminal acts, see id., at 141 ("[Banks] says, 'I thought I would give [the gun] to them so they could do the robberies.' I don't believe you [the jury] believe that."); id., at 143 ("a man doesn't travel two hundred miles . . . to supply [another] person with a weapon").  The special issue the prosecution addressed focused on what acts Banks would commit, not what harms he might facilitate: "Do you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the defendant, Delma Banks, Jr., would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added).  It is therefore unsurprising that the prosecution did not rest on Banks's facilitation of others' criminal acts in urging the jury to answer the second special issue (propensity to commit violent criminal acts) in the affirmative.

Because Banks had no criminal record, Farr's testimony about Banks's propensity to commit violent acts was crucial to the prosecution.  Without that testimony, the State could not have underscored, as it did three times in the penalty phase, that Banks would use the gun fetched in Dallas to "take care" of trouble arising during the robberies. App. 140, 144, 146-147; see supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1183-1184.  The stress placed by the prosecution on this part of Farr's testimony, uncorroborated by any other witness, belies the State's suggestion that "Farr's testimony was adequately corroborated." Brief for Respondent 22-25.   The prosecution's penalty-phase summation, moreover, left no doubt about the importance the State attached to Farr's testimony.  What Farr told the jury, the prosecution urged, was "of the utmost significance" to show "[Banks] is a danger to friends and strangers, alike." App. 146. 

In Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 289, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936, although the Court found "cause" for the petitioner's procedural default of a Brady claim, it found the requisite "prejudice" absent, 527 U.S. 263 at 292-296, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Regarding "prejudice," the contrast between Strickler and Banks's case is marked.  The witness whose impeachment was at issue in Strickler gave testimony that was in the main cumulative, id., 527 U.S. 263 at 292, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936, and hardly significant  to one of the "two predicates for capital murder: [armed] robbery," id., 527 U.S. 263 at 294, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Other evidence in the record, the Court found, provided strong support for the conviction even if the witness' testimony had been excluded entirely: Unlike the Banks prosecution, in Strickler, "considerable forensic and other physical evidence link[ed] [the defendant] to the crime" and supported the capital murder conviction.  Id., 527 U.S. 263 at 293, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Most tellingly, the witness' testimony in Strickler "did not relate to [the petitioner's] eligibility for the death sentence"; it "was not relied upon by the prosecution at all during its closing argument at the penalty phase." Id., 527 U.S. 263 at 295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  In contrast, Farr's testimony was the centerpiece of Banks's prosecution's penalty-phase case. 

Farr's trial testimony, critical at the penalty phase, was cast in large doubt by the declaration Banks ultimately obtained from Farr and introduced in the federal habeas proceeding.  See supra, at ____, ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1182, 1185.  In the guilt phase of Banks's trial, Farr had acknowledged his narcotics use.  App. 36.  In the penalty phase, Banks's counsel asked Farr if, "drawn up tight over" previous drug-related activity, he would "testify to anything anybody want[ed] to hear"; Farr denied this.  Id., at 110; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1183.  Farr's declaration supporting Banks's federal habeas petition, however, vividly contradicts that denial: "I assumed that if I did not help [Huff] . . . he would have me arrested for drug charges." App. 442, P 6.  Had jurors known of Farr's continuing interest in obtaining Deputy Sheriff Huff's favor, in addition to his receipt of funds to "set [Banks] up," id., at 442, P 7, they might well have distrusted Farr's testimony, and, insofar as it was uncorroborated, disregarded it. 

The jury, moreover, did not benefit from customary, truth-promoting precautions that generally accompany the testimony of informants.  This Court has long recognized the "serious questions of credibility" informers pose.  On Lee v. United States,343 U.S. 747, 757, 96 L. Ed. 1270, 72 S. Ct. 967 (1952).  See also Trott, Words of Warning for Prosecutors Using Criminals as Witnesses, 47 Hastings L. J. 1381, 1385 (1996) ("Jurors suspect [informants'] motives from the moment they hear about them in a case, and they frequently disregard their testimony altogether as highly untrustworthy and unreliable . . . .").  We have therefore allowed defendants "broad latitude to probe [informants'] credibility  by cross-examination" and have counseled submission of the credibility issue to the jury "with careful instructions." On Lee,343 U.S. 747 at 757, 96 L. Ed. 1270, 72 S. Ct. 967; accord Hoffa v. United States,385 U.S. 293, 311-312, 17 L. Ed. 2d 374, 87 S. Ct. 408 (1966).  See also 1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Criminal § 15.02 (5th ed. 2000) (jury instructions from the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits on special caution appropriate in assessing informant testimony). 

The State argues that "Farr was heavily impeached [at trial]," rendering his informant status "merely cumulative." Tr. of Oral Arg. 49; see Brief for Respondent 26-28; post, at ____, n 3, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1201.  The record suggests otherwise.  Neither witness called to impeach Farr gave evidence directly relevant to Farr's part in Banks's trial.  App. 124-133; id., at 129 (prosecutor noted that Kelley lacked "personal knowledge with regard to this case on trial").  The impeaching witnesses, Kelley and Owen, moreover, were themselves impeached, as the prosecution stressed on summation. See id., at 141, 148; supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1183-1184.  Further, the prosecution turned to its advantage remaining impeachment evidence concerning Farr's drug use.  On summation, the prosecution suggested that Farr's admission "that he used dope, that he shot," demonstrated that Farr had been "open and honest with [the jury] in every way." App. 140; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1184. 

 At least as to the penalty phase, in sum, one can hardly be confident that Banks received a fair trial, given the jury's ignorance of Farr's true role in the investigation and trial of the case.  See Kyles, 514 U.S. 419 at 434, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490, 115 S. Ct. 1555 ("The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in  its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.").  On the record before us, one could not plausibly deny the existence of the requisite "reasonable probability of a different result" had the suppressed information been disclosed to the defense. Ibid.(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Bagley, 473 U.S. 667 at 678, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481, 105 S. Ct. 3375); Strickler, 527 U.S. 263 at 290, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936.  Accordingly, as to the suppression of Farr's informant status and its bearing on "the reliability of the jury's verdict regarding punishment," App. to Pet. for Cert. C44; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1186, all three elements of a Brady claim are satisfied. 

III 

 Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals denied Banks a certificate of appealability with regard to his Cook Brady claim, which rested on the prosecution's suppression of the September 1980 Cook interrogation transcript.  App. 422-423; App. to Pet. for Cert. A52, A78; supra, at ____ - ____, ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1186-1188.  See also Joint Lodging Material 1-36.  The District Court and the Fifth Circuit concluded that Banks had not properly pleaded this claim because he had not sought leave to amend his petition, but had stated the claim only in other submissions, i.e., in his  proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and, again, in his objections to the Magistrate Judge's report.  App. 422-423, 432-433; App. to Pet. for Cert. A51-A52; supra, at ____ - ____, ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1186-1188.  Banks contended, unsuccessfully, that evidence substantiating the Cook Brady claim had been aired before the Magistrate Judge; therefore the claim should have been treated as if raised in the pleadings, as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) instructs.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A51-A52; supra, at ____, n 8, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1187 (setting out text of Rule 15(b)).  The Fifth Circuit stated its position on this point somewhat obliquely, but appears to have viewed Rule 15(b) as inapplicable in habeas proceedings; the State now concedes, however, that the question whether Rule 15(b) extends to habeas proceedings is one "jurists of reason would  find . . . debatable." Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. A52 (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000)), with Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.  We conclude that a certificate of appealability should have issued. 

We have twice before referenced Rule 15(b)'s application in federal habeas proceedings.  In Harris v. Nelson,394 U.S. 286, 294, n. 5, 22 L. Ed. 2d 281, 89 S. Ct. 1082 (1969), we noted that Rule 15(b)'s use in habeas proceedings is "noncontroversial." In Withrow v. Williams,507 U.S. 680, 696, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407, 113 S. Ct. 1745 (1993), we similarly assumed Rule 15(b)'s application to habeas petitions.  There, however, the District Court had granted a writ of habeas corpus on a claim neither pleaded, considered at "an evidentiary hearing," nor "even argu[ed]" by the parties. Id., 507 U.S. 680 at 695, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407, 113 S. Ct. 1745.  Given those circumstances, we held that there had been no trial of the claim by implied consent; the respondent warden, we observed, "was manifestly prejudiced by the District Court's failure to afford her an opportunity  to present evidence bearing on th[e] claim's resolution." Id., 507 U.S. 680 at 696, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407, 113 S. Ct. 1745.  Here, in contrast, the issue of the undisclosed Cook interrogation transcript was indeed aired before the Magistrate Judge, and the transcript itself was admitted into evidence without objection.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1186-1187. 19See Federal Evidentiary Hearing 56-73.  Examining one of Banks's prosecutors, counsel for Banks twice asked if Cook had been "instructed . . . on how to testify." Id., at 56.  See also id., at 63-64 ("Texarkana law enforcement did not instruct Mr. Cook how to testify in this case.  Is that your testimony today?").  To show that Cook had been coached, Banks's counsel called attention to discrepancies between portions of the September 1980 transcript and Cook's trial testimony. Id., at 65-68.  Concluding his examination, Banks's counsel emphasized the prosecution's duty to disclose the September 1980 transcript once Cook, while on the stand, stated that he had not been coached.  Id., at 73-74; App. 59; supra, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1181.

The Court of Appeals found no authority for equating "an evidentiary hearing . . . with a trial" for Rule 15(b) purposes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A52.  We see no reason why an evidentiary hearing should not qualify so long as the respondent gave "any sort of consent" and had a full and fair "opportunity to present evidence bearing on th[e] claim's resolution." Withrow, 507 U.S., 680 at 696, 123 L. Ed. 2d 407, 113 S. Ct. 1745.  Nor do we find convincing the Fifth Circuit's view that applying Rule 15(b) in habeas proceedings would undermine the State's exhaustion and procedural default defenses.  Ibid.Under pre-AEDPA law, there was no inconsistency between Rule 15(b) and those defenses.  That is doubtless why this Court's pre-AEDPA cases assumed Rule 15(b)'s application in habeas proceedings.  See ibid.; Harris, 394 U.S. 286 at 294, n. 5, 22 L. Ed. 2d 281, 89 S. Ct. 1082. 20Banks's case provides no occasion to consider Rule 15(b)'s application under the AEDPA regime. We note in this regard that, while AEDPA forbids a finding that exhaustion has been waived unless the State expressly waives the requirement, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(3) [28 USCS § 2254(b)(3)], under pre-AEDPA law, exhaustion and procedural default defenses could be waived based on the State's litigation conduct.  See Gray v. Netherland,518 U.S. 152, 166, 135 L. Ed. 2d 457, 116 S. Ct. 2074 (1996) (failure to raise procedural default in federal habeas court means the defense is lost); Granberry v. Greer,481 U.S. 129, 135, 95 L. Ed. 2d 119, 107 S. Ct. 1671 (1987) ("if a full trial has been held in the district court and it is evident that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, it may . . . be appropriate for the court of appeals to hold that the nonexhaustion defense has been waived"). 

To obtain a certificate of appealability, a prisoner must "demonstrat[e] that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further." Miller-El v. Cockrell,537 U.S. 322, 327, 154 L. Ed. 2d 931, 123 S. Ct. 1029 (2003).  At least as to the application of Rule 15(b), this case surely fits that description.  A certificate of appealability, therefore, should have issued. * * * 

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the  case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

The United States is subject to a cause of action for the benefit of at least some individuals adversely affected by a federal agency's violation of the Privacy Act of 1974.  The question before us is whether plaintiffs must prove some actual damages to qualify for a minimum statutory award of $1,000.  We hold that they must. 

I 

 Petitioner Buck Doe filed for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 83 Stat 792, 30 U.S.C. § 901 et seq. [30 USCS §§ 901 et seq.], with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, the division  of the Department of Labor responsible for adjudicating it.  The application form called for a Social Security number, which the agency then used to identify the applicant's claim, as on documents like "multicaptioned" notices of hearing dates, sent to groups of claimants, their employers, and the lawyers involved in their cases.  The Government concedes that following this practice led to disclosing Doe's Social Security number beyond the limits set by the Privacy Act. See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b) [5 USCS § 552a(b)]. 

Doe joined with six other black lung claimants to sue the Department of Labor, alleging repeated violations of the Act and seeking certification of a class of "'all claimants for Black Lung Benefits since the passage of the Privacy Act.'" Pet. for Cert. 6a.  Early on, the United States stipulated to an order prohibiting future publication of applicants' Social Security numbers on multicaptioned hearing notices, and the parties then filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court denied class certification and entered judgment against all individual plaintiffs except Doe, finding that their submissions had raised no issues of cognizable harm.  As to Doe, the Court accepted his uncontroverted evidence of distress on learning of the improper disclosure, granted summary judgment, and awarded $1,000 in statutory damages under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4) [5 USCS § 552a(g)(4)]. 

A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit affirmed in part but reversed on Doe's claim, holding the United States entitled to summary judgment across the board.  306 F.3d 170 (2002).  The Circuit treated the $1,000 statutory minimum as available only to plaintiffs who suffered actual damages because of the agency's violation, id., at 176-179, and then found that Doe had not raised a triable issue of fact about actual damages, having submitted no corroboration for his claim of emotional distress, such as evidence of physical symptoms, medical treatment, loss of income, or impact on his behavior.  In fact, the only indication of emotional affliction was Doe's conclusory allegations that he was "'torn . . .  all to pieces'" and "'greatly concerned and worried'" because of the disclosure of his Social Security number and its potentially "'devastating'" consequences. Id., at 181. 

Doe petitioned for review of the holding that some actual damages  must be proven before a plaintiff may receive the minimum statutory award.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Because the Fourth Circuit's decision requiring proof of actual damages conflicted with the views of other Circuits, see, e.g., Orekoya v. Mooney, 330 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2003); Wilborn v. Department of Health and Human Servs., 49 F.3d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1995); Waters v. Thornburgh, 281 U.S. App. D.C. 173, 888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Johnson v. Department of Treasury, 700 F.2d 971, 977, and n. 12 (5th Cir. 1983); Fitzpatrick v. IRS, 665 F.2d 327, 330-331 (11th Cir. 1982), we granted certiorari.  539 U.S. ___, 539 U.S. 957, 156 L. Ed. 2d 654, 123 S. Ct. 2640 (2003).  We now affirm.

 "[I]n order to protect the privacy of individuals identified in information systems maintained by Federal agencies, it is necessary . . . to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information by such agencies." Privacy Act of 1974, § 2(a)(5), 88 Stat 1896. The Act gives agencies detailed instructions for managing their records and provides for various sorts of civil relief to individuals aggrieved by failures on the Government's part to comply with the requirements. 

Subsection (g)(1) recognizes a civil action for agency misconduct fitting within any of four categories (the fourth, in issue here, being a catchall), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552a(g)(1)(A)-(D) [5 USCS §§ 552a(g)(1)(A)-(D)], and then makes separate provision for the redress of each.  The first two categories cover deficient management of records: subsection (g)(1)(A) provides for the correction of any inaccurate or otherwise improper material in a record, and subsection (g)(1)(B) provides a right of access against any agency refusing to allow an individual to inspect a record kept on him.  In each instance, further provisions specify  such things as the de novo nature of the suit (as distinct from any form of deferential review), §§ 552a(g)(2)(A), (g)(3)(A), and mechanisms for exercising judicial equity jurisdiction (by in camera inspection, for example), § 552a(g)(3)(A). 

The two remaining categories deal with derelictions having consequences beyond the statutory violations per se. Subsection (g)(1)(C) describes an agency's failure to maintain an adequate record on an individual, when the result is a determination "adverse" to that person.  Subsection (g)(1)(D) speaks of a violation when someone suffers an "adverse effect" from any other failure to hew to the terms of the Act.  Like the inspection and correction infractions, breaches of the statute with adverse consequences are addressed by specific terms governing relief: "In any suit brought under the provisions of subsection (g)(1)(C) or (D) of this section in which the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful, the United States shall be liable to the individual in an amount equal to the sum of-- "(A) actual damages sustained by the individual as a result of the refusal or failure, but in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000; and "(B) the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney  fees as determined by the court." § 552a(g)(4). 1The Privacy Act says nothing about standards of proof governing equitable relief that may be open to victims of adverse determinations or effects, although it may be that this inattention is explained by the general provisions for equitable relief within the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 USC § 706 [5 USCS § 706].  Indeed, the District Court relied on the APA in determining that it had jurisdiction to enforce the stipulated order prohibiting the Department of Labor from using Social Security numbers in multiparty captions.  Doe v. Herman, Civ. Action No. 97-0043-B (DC Va., Mar. 18, 1998), pp 9-11.

  III 

 Doe argues that subsection (g)(4)(A) entitles any plaintiff adversely affected by an intentional or willful violation to the $1,000 minimum on proof of nothing more than a statutory violation: anyone suffering an adverse consequence of intentional or willful disclosure is entitled to recovery.  The Government claims the minimum guarantee goes only to victims who prove some actual damages. We think the Government has the better side of the argument. 

To begin with, the Government's position is supported by a straightforward textual analysis.  When the statute gets to the point of guaranteeing the $1,000 minimum, it not only has confined any eligibility to victims of adverse effects caused by intentional or willful actions, but has provided expressly for liability to such victims for "actual damages sustained." It has made specific provision, in other words, for what a victim within the limited class may recover.  When the very next clause of the sentence containing the explicit provision guarantees $1,000 to a "person entitled to recovery," the simplest reading of that phrase looks back to the immediately preceding provision for recovering actual damages, which is also the Act's sole provision for recovering anything (as distinct from equitable relief).  With such an obvious referent for "person entitled to recovery" in the plaintiff who sustains "actual damages," Doe's theory is immediately questionable in ignoring the "actual damages" language so directly at hand and instead looking for "a person entitled to recovery" in a separate part of the statute devoid of any mention either of recovery or of what might be recovered. 

 Nor is it too strong to say that Doe does ignore statutory language.  When Doe reads the statute to mean that the United States shall be liable to any adversely affected subject of an intentional or willful violation, without more, he treats willful action as the last fact necessary to make the Government "liable," and he is thus able to describe anyone  to whom it is liable as entitled to the $1,000 guarantee.  But this way of reading the statute simply pays no attention to the fact that the statute does not speak of liability (and consequent entitlement to recovery) in a freestanding, unqualified way, but in a limited way, by reference to enumerated damages. 2Indeed, if adverse effect of intentional or willful violation were alone enough to make a person entitled to recovery, then Congress could have conditioned the entire subsection (g)(4)(A) as applying only to "a person entitled to recovery." That, of course, is not what Congress wrote.  As we mentioned before, Congress used the entitled-to-recovery phrase only to describe those entitled to the $1,000 guarantee, and it spoke of entitlement and guarantee only after referring to an individual's actual damages, indicating that "actual damages" is a further touchstone of the entitlement.

  Doe's manner of reading "entitle[ment] to recovery" as satisfied by adverse effect caused by intentional or willful violation is in tension with more than the text, however.  It is at odds with the traditional understanding that tort recovery requires not only wrongful act plus causation reaching to the plaintiff, but proof of some harm for which damages can reasonably be assessed.  See, e.g., W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts § 30 (5th ed. 1984).  Doe, instead, identifies a person as entitled to recover without any reference to proof of damages, actual or otherwise.  Doe might respond that it makes sense to speak of a privacy tort victim as entitled to recover without reference to damages because analogous common law would not require him to show particular items of injury in order to receive a dollar recovery.  Traditionally, the common law has provided such victims with a claim for "general" damages, which for privacy and defamation torts are presumed damages: a monetary award calculated without reference to specific harm. 33 Restatement of Torts § 621, Comment a (1938) ("It is not necessary for the plaintiff [who is seeking general damages in an action for defamation] to prove any specific harm to his reputation or any other loss caused thereby"); 4 id.,§ 867, Comment d (1939) (noting that damages are available for privacy torts "in the same way in which general damages are given for defamation," without proof of "pecuniary loss [or] physical harm"); see also 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts § 621, Comment a (1976).

  Such a rejoinder would not pass muster under the Privacy Act, however, because a provision of the Act not previously mentioned indicates beyond serious doubt that general damages are not authorized for a statutory violation.  An uncodified section of the Act established a Privacy Protection Study Commission, which was charged, among its other jobs, to consider "whether the Federal Government should be liable for general damages incurred by an individual as the result of a willful or intentional violation of the provisions of sections 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D) of title 5." 4The Commission ultimately recommended that the Act should "permit the recovery of special and general damages . . . but in no case should a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000 or more than the sum of $10,000 for general damages in excess of the dollar amount of any special damages." Personal Privacy in an Information Society: The Report of the Privacy Protection Study Commission 531 (July 1977).§ 5(c)(2)(B)(iii), 88 Stat 1907.  Congress left the question of general damages, that is, for another day.  Because presumed damages are therefore clearly unavailable, we have no business treating just any adversely affected victim of an intentional or willful violation as entitled to recovery, without something more. 

 This inference from the terms of the Commission's mandate is underscored by drafting history showing that Congress cut out the very language in the bill that would have authorized any presumed damages. 5 On this point, we do not understand Justice Ginsburg's dissent to take issue with our conclusion that Congress explicitly rejected the proposal to make presumed damages available for Privacy Act violations.  Instead, Justice Ginsburg appears to argue only that Congress would have wanted nonpecuniary harm to qualify as actual damages under subsection (g)(4)(A).  Post, at ____, n 4, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1140 (plaintiff may recover for emotional distress "'that he proves to have been actually suffered by him'" (quoting 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, at 402, Comment b)).  That issue, however, is not before us today.  See n 12, infra. The Senate bill would have authorized an award of "actual and  general damages  sustained by any person," with that language followed by the guarantee that "in no case shall a person entitled to recovery receive less than the sum of $1,000." S. 3418, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., § 303(c)(1) (1974).  Although the provision for general damages would have covered presumed damages, see n 3, supra, this language was trimmed from the final statute, subject to any later revision that might be recommended by the Commission.  The deletion of "general damages" from the bill is fairly seen, then, as a deliberate elimination of any possibility of imputing harm and awarding presumed damages. 6While theoretically there could also have been a third category, that of "nominal damages," it is implausible that Congress intended tacitly to recognize a nominal damages remedy after eliminating the explicit reference to general damages. The deletion thus precludes any hope of a sound interpretation of entitlement to recovery without reference to actual damages. 7Justice Scalia does not join this paragraph or footnote 8.

 Finally, Doe's reading is open to the objection that no purpose is served by conditioning the guarantee on a person's being entitled to recovery.  As Doe treats the text, Congress could have accomplished its object simply by providing that the Government would be liable to the individual for actual damages "but in no case . . . less than the sum of $1,000" plus fees and costs.  Doe's reading leaves the reference to entitlement to recovery with no job to do, and it accordingly accomplishes nothing. 8 Justice Ginsburg responds that our reading is subject to a similar criticism: "Congress more rationally [c]ould have written: 'actual damages . . . but in no case shall a person who proves such damages [in any amount] receive less than $1,000.'" Post, at ____ ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1137. Congress's use of the entitlement phrase actually contained in the statute, however, is explained by drafting history.  The first bill passed by the Senate authorized recovery of both actual and general damages. See infra, at ____ - ____,157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1139-1140.  At that point, when discussing eligibility for the $1,000 guarantee, it was reasonable to refer to plaintiffs with either sort of damages by the general term "a person entitled to recovery." When subsequent amendment limited recovery to actual damages by eliminating the general, no one apparently thought to delete the inclusive reference to entitlement. But this failure to remove the old language did not affect its reference to "actual damages," the term remaining from the original pair, "actual and general."

  IV 

 There are three loose ends.  Doe's argument suggests it would have been illogical for Congress to create a cause of action for anyone who suffers an adverse effect from intentional or willful agency action, then deny recovery without actual damages. But this objection assumes that the language in subsection (g)(1)(D) recognizing a federal "civil action" on the part of someone adversely affected was meant, without more, to provide a complete cause of action, and of course this is not so.  A subsequent provision requires proof of intent or willfulness in addition to adverse effect, and if the specific state of mind must be proven additionally, it is equally consistent with logic to require some actual damages as well.  Nor does our view deprive the language recognizing a civil action by an adversely affected person of any independent effect, for it may readily be understood as having a limited but specific function:  the reference in § 552a(g)(1)(D) to "adverse effect" acts as a term of art identifying a potential plaintiff who  satisfies the injury-in-fact and causation requirements of Article III standing, and who may consequently bring a civil action without suffering dismissal for want of standing to sue.  See Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., 514 U.S. 122, 126, 131 L. Ed. 2d 160, 115 S. Ct. 1278 (1995) ("The phrase 'person adversely affected or aggrieved' is a term of art used in many statutes to designate those who have standing to challenge or appeal an agency decision, within the agency or before the courts"); see also 5 USC § 702 [5 USCS § 702] (providing review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act to individuals who have been "adversely affected or aggrieved").  That is, an individual subjected to an adverse effect  has injury enough to open the courthouse door, but without more has no cause of action for damages under the Privacy Act. 9 Nor are we convinced by the analysis mentioned in the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, that any plaintiff who can demonstrate that he was adversely affected by intentional or willful agency action is entitled to costs and reasonable attorney's fees under § 552a(g)(4)(B), and is for that reason "a person entitled to recovery" under subsection (g)(4)(A).  See 306 F.3d 170, 188-189 (4th Cir. 2002).  Instead of treating damages as a recovery entitling a plaintiff to costs and fees, see, e.g.,42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) [42 USCS § 1988(b)] (allowing "a reasonable attorney's fee" to a "prevailing party" under many federal civil rights statutes); Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247-258, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141, 95 S. Ct. 1612 (1975) (discussing history of American courts' power to award fees and costs to prevailing plaintiffs), this analysis would treat costs and fees as the recovery entitling a plaintiff to minimum damages; it would get the cart before the horse.

 Next, Doe also suggests there is something peculiar in offering some guaranteed damages, as a form of presumed damages not requiring proof of amount, only to those plaintiffs who can demonstrate actual damages. But this approach parallels another remedial scheme that the drafters of the Privacy Act would probably have known about.  At common law, certain defamation torts were redressed by general damages but only when a plaintiff first proved some "special harm," i.e., "harm of a material and generally of a pecuniary nature." 3 Restatement of Torts § 575, Comments a and b (1938) (discussing defamation torts that are "not actionable per se"); see also 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts § 575, Comments a and b (1976) (same).  Plaintiffs claiming such torts could recover presumed damages only if they could demonstrate some actual, quantifiable pecuniary loss. Because the recovery of presumed damages in these cases was supplemental to compensation for specific harm, it was hardly unprecedented for Congress to make a guaranteed minimum contingent upon some showing of actual damages, thereby avoiding giveaways to plaintiffs with nothing  more than "abstract injuries," Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-102, 75 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 1660 (1983). 10 We also reject the related suggestion that the category of cases with actual damages not exceeding $1,000 is so small as to render the minimum award meaningless under our reading.  It is easy enough to imagine pecuniary expenses that might turn out to be reasonable in particular cases but fall well short of $1,000: fees associated with running a credit report, for example, or the charge for a Valium prescription.  Since we do not address the definition of actual damages today, see n 12, infra, this challenge is too speculative to overcome our interpretation of the statute's plain language and history.

 In a final effort to save his  claim, Doe points to a pair of statutes with remedial provisions that are worded similarly to § 552a(g)(4).  See Tax Reform Act of 1976, § 1201(i)(2)(A), 90 Stat 1665-1666, 26 U.S.C. § 6110(j)(2)(A) [26 USCS § 6110(j)(2)(A)]; § 1202(e)(1), 90 Stat 1687, 26 U.S.C. § 7217(c) (1976 ed., Supp. V) [26 USCS § 7217(c)]  (repealed 1982); Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, § 201, 100 Stat 1866, 18 U.S.C. § 2707(c) [18 USCS § 2707(c)].  He contends that legislative history of these subsequent enactments shows that Congress sometimes used language similar to 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(4) [5 USCS § 552a(g)(4)] with the object of authorizing true liquidated damages remedies.  See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 94-938, p 348 (1976) (discussing § 1202(e)(1) of the Tax Reform Act); S. Rep. No. 99-541, p 43 (1986) (discussing § 201 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act).  There are two problems with this argument.  First, as to § 1201(i)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act, the text is too far different from the language of the Privacy Act to serve as any sound basis for analogy; it does not include the critical limiting phrase "entitled to recovery." But even as to § 1202(e)(1) of the Tax Reform Act and § 201 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the trouble with Doe's position is its reliance on the legislative histories of completely separate statutes passed well after the Privacy Act. Those of us who look to legislative history have been wary about expecting to find reliable interpretive help outside the record of the statute being construed, and we have said repeatedly that "'subsequent legislative  history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment,'" Solid Waste Agency v. United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, 531 U.S. 159, 170, n. 5, 148 L. Ed. 2d 576, 121 S. Ct. 675 (2001) (quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 118, n. 13, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766, 100 S. Ct. 2051 (1980)). 11 In support of Doe's position, Justice Ginsburg's dissent also cites another item of extratextual material, an interpretation of the Privacy Act that was published by the Office of Management and Budget in 1975 as a guideline for federal agencies seeking to comply with the Act.  Post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1139-1140.  The dissent does not claim that any deference is due this interpretation, however, and we do not find its unelaborated conclusion persuasive.

V 

 The "entitle[ment] to recovery" necessary to qualify for the $1,000 minimum is not shown merely by an intentional or willful violation of the Act producing some adverse effect. The statute guarantees $1,000 only to plaintiffs who have suffered some actual damages. 12 The Courts of Appeals are divided on the precise definition of actual damages. Compare Fitzpatrick v. IRS, 665 F.2d 327, 331 (11th Cir. 1982) (actual damages are restricted to pecuniary loss), with Johnson v. Department of Treasury, 700 F.2d 971, 972-974 (5th Cir. 1983) (actual damages can cover adequately demonstrated mental anxiety even without any out-of-pocket loss).  That issue is not before us, however, since the petition for certiorari did not raise it for our review.  We assume without deciding that the Fourth Circuit was correct to hold that Doe's complaints in this case did not rise to the level of alleging actual damages. We do not suggest that out-of-pocket expenses are necessary for recovery of the $1,000 minimum; only that they suffice to qualify under any view of actual damages. The judgment of the Fourth Circuit is affirmed. 

 It is so ordered.  


Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA or Act), 81 Stat 602, 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. [29 USCS §§ 621 et seq.], forbids discriminatory preference for the young over the old.  The question in this case is whether it also prohibits favoring the old over the young.  We hold it does not. 

I 

In 1997, a collective-bargaining agreement between petitioner General Dynamics and the United Auto Workers eliminated the company's obligation to provide health benefits to subsequently retired employees, except as to then-current workers at least 50 years old.  Respondents (collectively, Cline) were then at least 40 and thus protected by the Act, see 29 U.S.C. § 631(a) [29 USCS § 631(a)], but under 50 and so without promise of the benefits.  All of them objected to the new terms, although some had retired before the change in order to get  the prior advantage, some retired afterwards with no benefit, and some worked on, knowing the new contract would give them no health coverage when they were through. 

Before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) they claimed that the agreement violated the ADEA, because it "discriminate[d against them] . . . with respect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of [their] age," § 623(a)(1).  The EEOC agreed, and invited General Dynamics and the union to settle informally with Cline. 

When they failed, Cline brought this action against General Dynamics, combining claims under the ADEA and state law.  The District Court called the federal claim one of "reverse age discrimination," upon which, it observed, no court had ever  granted relief under the ADEA.  98 F. Supp. 2d 846, 848 (ND Ohio 2000).  It dismissed in reliance on the Seventh Circuit's opinion in Hamilton v. Caterpillar Inc., 966 F.2d 1226 (1992), that "the ADEA 'does not protect . . . the younger against the older,'" id., at 1227 (quoting Karlen v. City Colleges of Chicago, 837 F.2d 314, 318 (CA7), cert denied sub nom.  Teachers v. City Colleges of Chicago, 486 U.S. 1044, 100 L. Ed. 2d 622, 108 S. Ct. 2038 (1988)). 

 A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit reversed, 296 F.3d 466 (2002), with the majority reasoning that the prohibition of § 623(a)(1), covering discrimination against "any individual . . . because of such individual's age," is so clear on its face that if Congress had meant to limit its coverage to protect only the older worker against the younger, it would have said so.  Id., at 472.  The court acknowledged the conflict of its ruling with earlier cases, including Hamilton and Schuler v. Polaroid Corp., 848 F.2d 276 (1988) (Breyer, J.), from the First Circuit, but it criticized the cases going the other way for paying too much attention to the "hortatory, generalized language" of the congressional findings incorporated in the ADEA.  296 F.3d at 470.  The Sixth Circuit  drew support for its view from the position taken by the EEOC in an interpretive regulation. 129 CFR § 1625.2(a) (2003) ("[I]f two people apply for the same position, and one is 42 and the other 52, the employer may not lawfully turn down either one on the basis of age, but must make such decision on the basis of some other factor").  We discuss this regulation at greater length, infra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1112-1113.Id., at 471. 

Judge Cole, concurring, saw the issue as one of plain meaning that produced no absurd result, although he acknowledged a degree of tension with O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.,517 U.S. 308, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433, 116 S. Ct. 1307 (1996), in which this Court spoke of age discrimination as giving better treatment to a "substantially younger" worker.  296 F.3d at 472.  Judge Williams dissented in preference for Hamilton and the consensus of the federal courts, thinking it "obvious that the older a person is, the greater his or her needs become." 296 F.3d at 476. 

We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the Circuits, 538 U.S. 976, 538 U.S. 976, 155 L. Ed. 2d 664, 123 S. Ct. 1786 (2003), and now reverse. 

II 

 The common ground in this case is the generalization that the ADEA's prohibition covers "discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age," 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) [29 USCS § 623(a)(1)], that helps the younger by hurting the older. In the abstract, the phrase is open to an argument for a broader construction, since reference to "age" carries no express modifier and the word could be read to look two ways.  This more expansive possible understanding does not, however, square with the natural reading of the whole provision prohibiting discrimination, and in fact Congress's interpretive clues speak almost unanimously to an understanding of discrimination as directed against workers who are older than the ones getting treated better. 

Congress chose not to include age within discrimination forbidden by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, § 715, 78 Stat. 265,  being aware that there were legitimate reasons  as well as invidious ones for making employment decisions on age.  Instead it called for a study of the issue by the Secretary of Labor, ibid., who concluded that age discrimination was a serious problem, but one different in kind from discrimination on account of race. 2That report found that "[e]mployment discrimination because of race is identified . . . with . . . feelings about people entirely unrelated to their ability to do the job.  There is no significant discrimination of this kind so far as older workers are concerned.  The most closely related kind of discrimination in the non-employment of older workers involves their rejection because of assumptions about the effect of age on their ability to do a job when there is in fact no basis for these assumptions." Report of the Secretary of Labor, The Older American Worker: Age Discrimination in Employment 2 (1965) (hereinafter Wirtz Report) (emphasis in original). The Secretary spoke of disadvantage to older individuals from arbitrary and stereotypical employment distinctions (including then-common policies of age ceilings on hiring), but he examined the problem in light of rational considerations of increased pension cost and, in some cases, legitimate concerns about an older person's ability to do the job.  Wirtz Report 2.  When the Secretary ultimately took the position that arbitrary discrimination against older workers was widespread and persistent enough to call for a federal legislative remedy, id., at 21-22, he placed his recommendation against the background of common experience that the potential cost of employing someone rises with age, so that the older an employee is, the greater the inducement to prefer a younger substitute.  The report contains no suggestion that reactions to age level off at some point, and it was devoid of any indication that the Secretary had noticed unfair advantages accruing to older employees at the expense of their juniors. 

Congress then asked for a specific proposal, Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, § 606, 80 Stat. 845, which the Secretary provided in January 1967.  113 Cong. Rec. 1377 (1967); see also Public Papers of the Presidents, Lyndon  B. Johnson, Vol. 1, Jan. 23, 1967, p 37 (1968) (message to Congress urging that "[o]pportunity . . . be opened to the many Americans over 45 who are qualified and willing to work").  Extensive House and Senate hearings ensued.  See Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on H. R. 3651 et al. before the General Subcommittee on Labor of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter House Hearings); Age Discrimination in Employment: Hearings on S. 830 and S. 788 before the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967) (hereinafter Senate Hearings).  See generally EEOC v. Wyoming,460 U.S. 226, 229-233, 75 L. Ed. 2d 18, 103 S. Ct. 1054 (1983). 

The testimony at both hearings dwelled on unjustified assumptions about the effect of age on ability to work.  See, e.g.,House Hearings 151 (statement of Rep. Joshua Eilberg) ("At age 40, a worker may find that age restrictions become common . . . .  By age 45, his employment opportunities are likely to contract sharply; they shrink more severely at age 55 and virtually vanish by age 65"); id., at 422 (statement of Rep. Claude Pepper) ("We must provide meaningful opportunities for employment to the thousands of workers 45 and over who are well qualified but nevertheless denied jobs which they may desperately need because someone  has arbitrarily decided that they are too old"); Senate Hearings 34 (statement of Sen. George Murphy) ("[A]n older worker often faces an attitude on the part of some employers that prevents him from receiving serious consideration or even an interview in his search for employment"). 3See also House Hearings 449 (statement of Rep. James A. Burke) ("Discrimination arises for [the older job seeker] because of assumptions that are made about the effects of age on performance"); Senate Hearings 179 (statement of Dr. Harold L. Sheppard) ("[O]ne of the underlying conditions for this upward trend in unemployment rates for a given group of so-called older workers over a period of time . . . is related to the barrier of age discrimination"); id., at 215 (statement of Sen. Harrison A. Williams) ("'Unfavorable beliefs and generalizations about older persons have grown up and have been translated into restrictive policies and practices in hiring new employees which bar older jobseekers from employment principally because of age'" (quoting earlier report of Senate Special Committee on Aging)). The hearings specifically  addressed higher pension and benefit costs as heavier drags on hiring workers the older they got.  See, e.g.,House Hearings 45 (statement of Norman Sprague) (Apart from stereotypes, "labor market conditions, seniority and promotion-from-within policies, job training costs, pension and insurance costs, and mandatory retirement policies often make employers reluctant to hire older workers").  The record thus reflects the common facts that an individual's chances to find and keep a job get worse over time; as between any two people, the younger is in the stronger position, the older more apt to be tagged with demeaning stereotype.  Not surprisingly, from the voluminous records of the hearings, we have found (and Cline has cited) nothing suggesting that any workers were registering complaints about discrimination in favor of their seniors. 

 Nor is there any such suggestion in the introductory provisions of the ADEA, 81 Stat. 602, which begins with statements of purpose and findings that mirror the Wirtz Report and the committee transcripts.  Id., § 2.  The findings stress the impediments suffered by "older workers . . . in their efforts to retain . . . and especially to regain employment," id., § 2(a)(1); "the [burdens] of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance," id., § 2(a)(2); the costs of "otherwise desirable practices [that] may work to the disadvantage of older persons," ibid.; and "the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment[, which] is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers," id., § 2(a)(3).  The statutory objects were "to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; [and]  to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment." Id., § 2(b). 

 In sum, except on one point, all the findings and statements of objectives are either cast in terms of the effects of age as intensifying over time, or are couched in terms that refer to "older" workers, explicitly or implicitly relative to "younger" ones.  The single subject on which the statute speaks less specifically is that of "arbitrary limits" or "arbitrary age discrimination." But these are unmistakable references to the Wirtz Report's finding that "[a]lmost three out of every five employers covered by [a] 1965 survey have in effect age limitations (most frequently between 45 and 55) on new hires which they  apply without consideration of an applicant's other qualifications." Wirtz Report 6.  The ADEA's ban on "arbitrary limits" thus applies to age caps that exclude older applicants, necessarily to the advantage of younger ones. 

 Such is the setting of the ADEA's core substantive provision, § 4 (as amended, 29 USC § 623 [29 USCS § 623]), prohibiting employers and certain others from "discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age," whenever (as originally enacted) the individual is "at least forty years of age but less than sixty-five years of age," § 12, 81 Stat. 607. 4In 1978, Congress changed the upper age limit to 70 years, Pub. L. 95-256, § 3(a), 92 Stat. 189, and then struck it entirely in 1986, Pub. L. 99-592, § 2(c)(1), 100 Stat. 3342.  The President transferred authority over the ADEA from the Department of Labor to the EEOC in 1978.  Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App. § 2, p 206 [note following 42 USCS § 2000e-4].  Congress has also made other changes, including extending the ADEA to government employees (state, local, and federal), Pub L 93-259, 88 Stat 74-75 (amending 29 USC § 630(b) [29 USCS § 630(b) and adding § 633a)], and clarifying that it extends, with certain exceptions, to employee benefits, Pub L 101-433, 104 Stat 978 (amending among other provisions 29 U.S.C. § 630(l) [29 USCS § 630(l)]). The prefatory provisions and their legislative history make a case that we think is beyond reasonable doubt, that the ADEA was concerned  to protect a relatively old worker from discrimination that works to the advantage of the relatively young. 

Nor is it remarkable that the record is devoid of any evidence that younger workers were suffering at the expense of their elders, let alone that a social problem required a federal statute to place a younger worker in parity with an older one.  Common experience is to the contrary, and the testimony, reports, and congressional findings simply confirm that Congress used the phrase "discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age" the same way that ordinary people in common usage might speak of age discrimination any day of the week.  One commonplace conception of American society in recent decades is its character as a "youth culture," and in a world where younger is better, talk about discrimination because of age is naturally understood to refer to discrimination against the older. 

 This same, idiomatic sense of the statutory phrase is confirmed by the statute's restriction of the protected class to those 40 and above.  If Congress had been worrying about protecting the younger against the older, it would not likely have ignored everyone under 40.  The youthful deficiencies of inexperience and unsteadiness invite stereotypical and discriminatory thinking about those a lot younger than 40, and prejudice suffered by a 40-year-old is not typically owing to youth, as 40-year-olds sadly tend to find out.  The enemy of 40 is 30, not 50.  See H. R. Rep. No. 805, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1967) ("[T]estimony indicated [40] to be the age at which age discrimination in employment becomes evident").  Even so, the 40-year threshold was adopted over the objection that some discrimination against older people begins at an even younger age; female flight attendants were not fired at 32 because they were too young, ibid. See also Senate Hearings 47 (statement of Sec'y Wirtz) (lowering the minimum age limit "would change the nature of the proposal from an over-age employment discrimination measure").  Thus, the 40-year threshold makes sense as identifying  a class requiring  protection against preference for their juniors, not as defining a class that might be threatened by favoritism toward seniors. 5 Justice Thomas, post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1117-1121 (dissenting opinion), charges our holding with unnaturally limiting a comprehensive prohibition of age discrimination to "the principal evil that Congress targeted," post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1117, which he calls inconsistent with the method of McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,427 U.S. 273, 49 L. Ed. 2d 493, 96 S. Ct. 2574 (1976) (the Title VII prohibition of discrimination because of race protects whites), and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U.S. 75, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201, 118 S. Ct. 998 (1998) (the Title VII prohibition of discrimination because of sex protects men from sexual harassment by other men).  His objection is aimed at the wrong place.  As we discuss at greater length infra, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1110-1111, we are not dealing here with a prohibition expressed by the unqualified use of a term without any conventionally narrow sense (as "race" or "sex" are used in Title VII), and are not narrowing such a prohibition so that it covers only instances of the particular practice that induced Congress to enact the general prohibition.  We hold that Congress expressed a prohibition by using a term in a commonly understood, narrow sense ("age" as "relatively old age").  Justice Thomas may think we are mistaken, post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1115-1117, when we infer that Congress used "age" as meaning the antithesis of youth rather than meaning any age, but we are not making the particular mistake of confining the application of terms used in a broad sense to the relatively narrow class of cases that prompted Congress to address their subject matter.

 The federal reports are as replete with cases taking this position as they are nearly devoid of decisions like the one reviewed here.  To start closest to home, the best example is Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,507 U.S. 604, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993), in which we held there is no violation of the ADEA in firing an employee because his pension is about to vest, a basis for action that we took to be analytically distinct from age, even though it would never occur without advanced years.  Id., at 611-612, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701.  We said that "the very essence of age discrimination [is] for an older employee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and competence decline with old age," id., at 610, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701, whereas discrimination on the basis of pension status "would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age [because t]he prohibited stereotype [of  the faltering worker] would not have figured in this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue," id., at 612, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338, 113 S. Ct. 1701.  And we have relied on this same reading of the statute in other cases.  See, e.g., O'Connor, 517 U.S., at 313, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433, 116 S. Ct. 1307  ("Because the ADEA prohibits discrimination on the basis of age . . . the fact that a replacement is substantially younger than the plaintiff is a . . . reliable indicator of age discrimination"); Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,472 U.S. 400, 409, 86 L. Ed. 2d 321, 105 S. Ct. 2743 (1985) ("[T]he legislative history of the ADEA . . . repeatedly emphasize[s that] the process of psychological and physiological degeneration caused by aging varies with each individual").  While none of these cases directly addresses the question presented here, all of them show our consistent understanding that the text, structure, and history point to the ADEA as a remedy for unfair preference based on relative youth, leaving complaints of the relatively young outside the statutory concern. 

The Courts of Appeals and the District Courts have read the law the same way, and prior to this case have enjoyed virtually unanimous  accord in understanding the ADEA to forbid only discrimination preferring young to old.  So the Seventh Circuit held in Hamilton, and the First Circuit said in Schuler, and so the District Courts have ruled in cases too numerous for citation here in the text. 6See Lawrence v. Irondequoit, 246 F. Supp. 2d 150, 161 (WDNY 2002) (following Hamilton); Greer v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 85 FEP Cases 416, 419 (SDNY 2001) (noting unanimity of the courts); Dittman v. General Motors Corp.-Delco Chassis Div., 941 F. Supp. 284, 286-287 (Conn. 1996) (alternative holding) (following Hamilton); Parker v. Wakelin, 882 F. Supp. 1131, 1140 (Me. 1995) ("The ADEA has never been construed to permit younger persons to claim discrimination against them in favor of older persons"); Wehrly v. American Motors Sales Corp., 678 F. Supp. 1366, 1382 (ND Ind. 1988) (following Karlen v. City Colleges of Chicago, 837 F.2d 314, 318 (CA7), cert denied sub nom. Teachers v. City Colleges of Chicago, 486 U.S. 1044, 100 L. Ed. 2d 622, 108 S. Ct. 2038 (1988)).  The only case we have found arguably to the contrary is Mississippi Power & Light Co. v Local Union Nos. 605 & 985, IBEW, 945 F. Supp. 980, 985 (SD Miss. 1996), which allowed a claim objecting to a benefit given to individuals between 60 and 65 and denied to those outside that range, without discussing Hamilton or any of the other authority holding that the plaintiffs under 60 would lack a cause of action. The very  strength of this consensus is enough to rule out any serious claim of ambiguity, and congressional silence after years of judicial interpretation supports adherence to the traditional view. 7Congress has not been shy in revising other judicial constructions of the ADEA.  See Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,492 U.S. 158, 167-168, 106 L. Ed. 2d 134, 109 S. Ct. 2854 (1989) (observing that the 1978 amendment to the ADEA "changed the specific result" of this Court's earlier case of United Air Lines, Inc. v. McMann,434 U.S. 192, 54 L. Ed. 2d 402, 98 S. Ct. 444 (1977)); H. R. Rep. No. 101-664, pp 10-11, 34 (1990) (stating that Congress in 1978 had also disapproved McMann's reasoning, and that with the 1990 amendments it meant to overrule Betts as well).

III 

 Cline and amicus EEOC proffer three rejoinders in favor of their competing view that the prohibition works both ways.  First, they say (as does Justice Thomas, post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1114-1116) that the statute's meaning is plain when the word "age" receives its natural and ordinary meaning and the statute is read as a whole giving "age" the same meaning throughout.  And even if the text does not plainly mean what they say it means, they argue that the soundness of their version is shown by a colloquy on the floor of the Senate involving Senator Yarborough, a sponsor of the bill that became the ADEA.  Finally, they fall back to the position (fortified by Justice Scalia's dissent) that we should defer to the EEOC's reading of the statute.  On each point, however, we think the argument falls short of unsettling our view of the natural meaning of the phrase speaking of discrimination, read in light of the statute's manifest purpose. 

A 

 The first response to our reading is the dictionary argument that "age" means the length of a person's life, with the  phrase "because of such individual's age" stating a simple test of causation: "discriminat[ion] . . . because of [an] individual's age" is treatment that would not have occurred if the individual's span of years had been longer or shorter.  The case for this reading calls attention to the other instances of "age" in the ADEA that are not limited to old age, such as 29 U.S.C. § 623(f) [29 USCS § 623(f)], which gives an employer a defense to charges of age discrimination when "age is a bona  fide occupational qualification." Cline and the EEOC argue that if "age" meant old age, § 623(f) would then provide a defense (old age is a bona fide qualification) only for an employer's action that on our reading would never clash with the statute (because preferring the older is not forbidden). 

 The argument rests on two mistakes.  First, it assumes that the word "age" has the same meaning wherever the ADEA uses it.  But this is not so, and Cline simply misemploys the "presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning." Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States,286 U.S. 427, 433, 76 L. Ed. 1204, 52 S. Ct. 607 (1932).  Cline forgets that "the presumption is not rigid and readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent." Ibid.; see also United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. 200, 213, 149 L. Ed. 2d 401, 121 S. Ct. 1433 (2001) (phrase "wages paid" has different meanings in different parts of Title 26 USC [26 USCS]); Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 343-344, 136 L. Ed. 2d 808, 117 S. Ct. 843 (1997) (term "employee" has different meanings in different parts of Title VII).  The presumption of uniform usage thus relents 8It gets too little credit for relenting, though.  "The tendency to assume that a word which appears in two or more legal rules, and so in connection with more than one purpose, has and should have precisely the same scope in all of them, runs all through legal discussions.  It has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against." Cook, "Substance" and "Procedure" in the Conflict of Laws, 42 Yale L. J. 333, 337 (1933).  The passage has become a staple of our opinions.  See United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U.S. 200, 213, 149 L. Ed. 2d 401, 121 S. Ct. 1433 (2001); NationsBank of N. C., N. A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,513 U.S. 251, 262, 130 L. Ed. 2d 740, 115 S. Ct. 810 (1995); CAB v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,367 U.S. 316, 328, 6 L. Ed. 2d 869, 81 S. Ct. 1611 (1961). when a word used has several commonly understood meanings among which a speaker can alternate in the course of an ordinary conversation, without being confused or getting confusing. 

 "Age" is that kind of word.  As Justice Thomas (post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1115) agrees, the word "age" standing alone can be readily understood either as pointing to any number of years lived, or as common shorthand for the longer span and concurrent aches that make youth look good.  Which alternative was probably intended is a matter of context; we understand the different choices of meaning that lie behind a sentence like "Age can be shown by a driver's license," and the statement, "Age has left him a shut-in." So it is easy to understand that Congress chose different meanings at different places in the ADEA, as the different settings readily show.  Hence the second flaw in Cline's argument for uniform usage: it ignores the cardinal rule that "[s]tatutory language must be read in context [since] a phrase 'gathers meaning from the words around it.'" Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 389, 144 L. Ed. 2d 370, 119 S. Ct. 2090 (1999) (quoting Jarecki v. G. D. Searle & Co.,367 U.S. 303, 307, 6 L. Ed. 2d 859, 81 S. Ct. 1579, 1961-2 C.B. 254 (1961)).  The point here is that we are not asking an abstract question about the meaning of "age"; we are seeking the meaning of the whole phrase "discriminate . . . because of such individual's age," where it occurs in the ADEA,  29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) [29 USCS § 623(a)(1)].  As we have said, social history emphatically reveals an understanding of age discrimination as aimed against the old, and the statutory reference to age discrimination in this idiomatic sense is confirmed by legislative history. For the very reason that reference to context shows that "age" means "old age" when teamed with "discrimination," the provision of an affirmative defense when age is a bona fide occupational qualification readily shows that "age" as a qualification means comparative youth. As  context tells us that "age" means one thing in § 623(a)(1) and another in § 623(f), 9An even wider contextual enquiry supports our conclusion, for the uniformity Cline and the EEOC claim for the uses of "age" within the ADEA itself would introduce unwelcome discord among the federal statutes on employee benefit plans.  For example, the Tax Code requires an employer to allow certain employees who reach age 55 to diversify their stock ownership plans in part, 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(28)(B) [26 USCS § 401(a)(28)(B)]; removes a penalty on early distributions from retirement plans at age 59 1/2, § 72(t)(2)(A)(i); requires an employer to allow many employees to receive benefits immediately upon retiring at age 65, § 401(a)(14); and requires an employer to adjust upward an employee's pension benefits if that employee continues to work past age 70 1/2, § 401(a)(9)(C)(iii).  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 makes similar provisions.  See, e.g.,29 U.S.C. § 1002(24) [29 USCS § 1002(24)] ("normal retirement age" may come at age 65, although the plan specifies later); § 1053(a) (a plan must pay full benefits to employees who retire at normal retirement age).  Taken one at a time any of these statutory directives might be viewed as an exception Congress carved out of a generally recognized principle that employers may not give benefits to older employees that they withhold from younger ones.  Viewed as a whole, however, they are incoherent with the alleged congressional belief that such a background principle existed. so it also tells us that the presumption of uniformity cannot sensibly operate here. 10 Essentially the same answer suffices for Cline's and the EEOC's suggestion that our reading is at odds with the statute's ban on employers' "print[ing] . . . any notice or advertisement relating to employment . . . indicating any preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination . . . based on age." § 623(e).

 The comparisons Justice Thomas urges, post, at ____ - ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1118-1121, to McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,427 U.S. 273, 49 L. Ed. 2d 493, 96 S. Ct. 2574 (1976), and Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.,523 U.S. 75, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201, 118 S. Ct. 998 (1998), serve to clarify our position.  Both cases involved Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. [42 USCS §§ 2000e et seq.], and its prohibition on employment discrimination "because of [an] individual's race . . . [or] sex," § 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added).  The term "age" employed by the ADEA is not, however, comparable to the terms "race" or "sex" employed by Title VII.  "Race" and "sex" are general terms that in every day usage require modifiers to indicate  any relatively narrow application.  We do not commonly understand "race" to refer only to the black race, or "sex" to refer only to the female.  But the prohibition of age discrimination is readily read more narrowly than analogous provisions dealing with race and sex. That narrower reading is the more natural one in the textual setting, and it makes perfect sense because of Congress's demonstrated concern with distinctions that hurt older people. 

B 

 The second objection has more substance than the first, but still not enough.  The record of congressional action reports a colloquy on the Senate  floor between two of the legislators most active in pushing for the ADEA, Senators Javits and Yarborough.  Senator Javits began the exchange by raising a concern mentioned by Senator Dominick, that "the bill might not forbid discrimination between two persons each of whom would be between the ages of 40 and 65." 113 Cong. Rec. 31255 (1967).  Senator Javits then gave his own view that, "if two individuals ages 52 and 42 apply for the same job, and the employer selected the man aged 42 solely . . . because he is younger than the man 52, then he will have violated the act," and asked Senator Yarborough for his opinion.  Ibid. Senator Yarborough answered that "[t]he law prohibits age being a factor in the decision to hire, as to one age over the other, whichever way [the] decision went." Ibid.

Although in the past we have given weight to Senator Yarborough's views on the construction of the ADEA because he was a sponsor, see, e.g., Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts, 492 U.S. 158, 179, 106 L. Ed. 2d 134, 109 S. Ct. 2854 (1989), his side of this exchange is not enough to unsettle our reading of the statute.  It is not merely that the discussion was prompted by the question mentioned in O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 134 L. Ed. 2d 433, 116 S. Ct. 1307 (1996), the possibility of a 52-year-old suing over a preference for someone  younger but in the over-40 protected class.  What matters is that the Senator's remark, "whichever way [the] decision went," is the only item in all the 1967 hearings, reports, and debates going against the grain of the common understanding of age discrimination. 11It is only fair to add, though, that Senator Dominick himself does appear to have sought clarification on the question presented, asking in a statement appended to the Committee Report whether "the prospective employer [is] open to a charge of discrimination if he hires the younger man and would . . . be open to a charge of discrimination by the younger man if he hired the older one." S. Rep. No. 723, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 15-16 (1967); see also id., at 16 (mentioning confusion among committee counsel).  Senator Dominick considered this result undesirable.  See ibid. ("[M]any legal complexities surrounding this bill . . . have not been adequately dealt with by the committee"). Even from a sponsor, a single outlying statement cannot stand against a tide of context and history, not to mention 30 years of judicial interpretation producing no apparent legislative qualms.  See Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,447 U.S. 102, 118, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766, 100 S. Ct. 2051 (1980)("[O]rdinarily even the contemporaneous remarks of a single legislator who sponsors a bill are not controlling in analyzing legislative history"). 

C 

 The third objection relies on a reading consistent with the Yarborough comment, adopted by the agency now charged with enforcing the statute, as set out at 29 CFR § 1625.2(a) (2003), and quoted in full, n 1, supra. When the EEOC adopted § 1625.2(a) in 1981, shortly after assuming administrative responsibility for the ADEA, it gave no reasons for the view expressed, beyond noting that the provision was carried forward from an earlier Department of Labor regulation, see 44 Fed. Reg. 68,858 (1979); 46 Fed. Reg. 47,724 (1981); that earlier regulation itself gave no reasons, see 33 Fed. Reg. 9,172 (1968) (reprinting 29 CFR § 860.91, rescinded by 46 Fed. Reg. 47,724 (1981)). 

 The parties contest the degree of weight owed to the EEOC's reading, with General Dynamics urging us that Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,323 U.S. 134, 89 L. Ed. 124, 65 S. Ct. 161 (1944), sets the limit, while Cline and the EEOC say that § 1625.2(a) deserves greater deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984).  Although we have devoted a fair amount of attention lately to the varying degrees of deference deserved by agency pronouncements of different sorts, see United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292, 121 S. Ct. 2164 (2001); Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621, 120 S. Ct. 1655 (2000), the recent cases are not on point here.  In Edelman v. Lynchburg College,535 U.S. 106, 114, 152 L. Ed. 2d 188, 122 S. Ct. 1145 (2002), we found no need to choose between Skidmore and Chevron, or even to defer, because the EEOC was clearly right; today, we neither defer nor settle on any degree of deference because the Commission is clearly wrong. 

Even for an agency able to claim all the authority possible under Chevron, deference to its statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.  INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,480 U.S. 421, 446-448, 94 L. Ed. 2d 434, 107 S. Ct. 1207 (1987) (citing Chevron, supra, at 843, n. 9, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778).  Here, regular interpretive method leaves no serious question, not even about purely textual ambiguity in the ADEA.  The word "age" takes on a definite meaning from being in the phrase "discriminat[ion] . . . because of such individual's age," occurring as that phrase does in a statute structured and manifestly intended to protect the older from arbitrary favor for the younger. 

IV 

 We see the text, structure, purpose, and history of the ADEA, along with its relationship to other federal statutes, as showing that the statute does not mean to stop an employer from favoring an older employee over a younger one.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.  


Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Petitioner conducted a search of respondents' home pursuant to a warrant that failed to describe the "persons or things to be seized." U.S. Const., Amdt. 4.  The questions presented are (1) whether the search violated the Fourth Amendment, and (2) if so, whether petitioner nevertheless is entitled to qualified immunity, given that a Magistrate Judge (Magistrate), relying on an affidavit that particularly described the items in question, found probable cause to conduct the search. 

 I 

Respondents, Joseph Ramirez and members of his family, live on a large ranch in Butte-Silver Bow County, Montana.  Petitioner, Jeff Groh, has been a Special Agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) since 1989.  In February 1997, a concerned citizen informed petitioner that on a number of visits to respondents' ranch the visitor had seen a large stock of weaponry, including an automatic rifle, grenades, a grenade launcher, and a rocket launcher. 1Possession of these items, if unregistered, would violate 18 U.S.C. § 922(o)(1) [18 USCS § 922(o)(1)] and 26 USC § 5861 [26 USCS § 5861]. Based on that information, petitioner prepared and signed an application for a warrant to search the ranch. The application stated that the search was for "any automatic firearms or parts to automatic weapons, destructive devices to include but not limited to grenades, grenade launchers, rocket launchers, and any and all receipts pertaining to the purchase or manufacture of automatic weapons or explosive devices or launchers." App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.  Petitioner supported the application with a detailed affidavit, which he also prepared and executed, that set forth the basis for his belief that the listed items were concealed on the ranch. Petitioner then presented these documents to a Magistrate, along with a warrant form that petitioner also had completed.  The Magistrate signed the warrant form. 

Although the application particularly described the place to be searched and the contraband petitioner expected to find, the warrant itself was less specific; it failed to identify any of the items that petitioner intended to seize. In the portion of the form that called for a description of the "person or property" to be seized, petitioner typed a description of respondents' two-story blue house rather than the alleged stockpile of firearms. 2The warrant stated: "[T]here is now concealed [on the specified premises] a certain person or property, namely [a] single dwelling residence two story in height which is blue in color and has two additions attached to the east.  The front entrance to the residence faces in a southerly direction." App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. The warrant did not incorporate by  reference the itemized list contained in the application.  It did, however, recite that the Magistrate was satisfied the affidavit established probable cause to believe that contraband was concealed on the premises, and that sufficient  grounds existed for the warrant's issuance. 3The affidavit was sealed.  Its sufficiency is not disputed.

The day after the Magistrate issued the warrant, petitioner led a team of law enforcement officers, including both federal agents and members of the local sheriff's department, in the search of respondents' premises.  Although respondent Joseph Ramirez was not home, his wife and children were.  Petitioner states that he orally described the objects of the search to Mrs. Ramirez in person and to Mr. Ramirez by telephone.  According to Mrs. Ramirez, however, petitioner explained only that he was searching for "'an explosive device in a box.'" Ramirez v. Butte-Silver Bow County, 298 F.3d 1022, 1026 (CA9 2002).  At any rate, the officers' search uncovered no illegal weapons or explosives. When the officers left, petitioner gave Mrs. Ramirez a copy of the search warrant, but not a copy of the application, which had been sealed.  The following day, in response to a request from respondents' attorney, petitioner faxed the attorney a copy of the page of the application that listed the items to be seized. No charges were filed against the Ramirezes. 

Respondents sued petitioner and the other officers under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,403 U.S. 388, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619, 91 S. Ct. 1999 (1971), and Rev Stat § 1979, 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983], raising eight claims, including violation of the Fourth Amendment. App. 17-27.  The District Court entered summary judgment for all defendants.  The court found no Fourth Amendment violation, because it considered the case comparable to one in which the warrant contained an inaccurate address, and in such a case, the court reasoned, the warrant is sufficiently  detailed if the executing officers can locate the correct house.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-22a.  The court added that even if a constitutional violation occurred, the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the failure of the warrant to describe the objects of the search amounted to a mere "typographical error." Id., at 22a-24a. 

The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment with respect to all defendants and all claims, with the exception of respondents' Fourth Amendment claim against petitioner.  298 F.3d at 1029-1030.  On that claim, the court held that the warrant was invalid because it did not "describe with particularity the place to be searched and the items to be seized," and that oral statements by petitioner during or after the search could not cure the omission.  Id., at 1025-1026.  The court observed that the warrant's facial defect "increased the likelihood and degree of confrontation between the Ramirezes and the police" and deprived respondents of the means "to challenge officers who might have exceeded the limits imposed by the magistrate." Id., at 1027.  The court also expressed concern that "permitting officers to expand the scope of the warrant by oral statements would broaden the area of dispute between the parties in subsequent litigation." Ibid. The court nevertheless concluded that all of the officers except petitioner were protected by qualified immunity. With respect to petitioner, the court read our opinion in United States v. Leon,468 U.S. 897, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, 104 S. Ct. 3405 (1984), as precluding qualified immunity for the leader of  a search who fails to "read the warrant and satisfy [himself] that [he] understand[s] its scope and limitations, and that it is not defective in some obvious way." 298 F.3d at 1027.  The court added that "[t]he leaders of the search team must also make sure that a copy of the warrant is available to give to the person whose property is being searched at the commencement of the search, and that such copy has no missing pages or other obvious defects." Ibid.  (footnote omitted).  We granted certiorari.  537 U.S. 1231, 155 L. Ed. 2d 195, 123 S. Ct. 1354 (2003). 

 II 

 The warrant was plainly invalid.  The Fourth Amendment states unambiguously that "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." (Emphasis added.) The warrant in this case complied with the first three of these requirements: It was based on probable cause and supported by a sworn affidavit, and it described particularly the place of the search.  On the fourth requirement, however, the warrant failed altogether.  Indeed, petitioner concedes that "the warrant . . . was deficient in particularity because it provided no description of the type of evidence sought." Brief for Petitioner 10. 

 The fact that the application adequately described the "things to be seized" does not save the warrant from its facial invalidity.  The Fourth Amendment by its terms requires particularity in the warrant, not in the supporting documents.  See Massachusetts v. Sheppard,468 U.S. 981, 988, n. 5, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424 (1984) ("[A] warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional");  see also United States v. Stefonek, 179 F.3d 1030, 1033 (CA7 1999) ("The Fourth Amendment requires that the warrant particularly describe the things to be seized, not the papers presented to the judicial officer . . . asked to issue the warrant").  And for good reason: "The presence of a search warrant serves a high function," McDonald v. United States,335 U.S. 451, 455, 93 L. Ed. 153, 69 S. Ct. 191 (1948), and that high function is not necessarily vindicated when some other document, somewhere, says something about the objects of the search, but the contents of that document are neither known to the person whose home is being searched nor available for her inspection.  We do not say that the Fourth Amendment prohibits a warrant from cross-referencing other documents.  Indeed, most Courts of Appeals have held that a court may construe a warrant with reference to a supporting application or affidavit if the warrant  uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant.  See, e.g., United States v. McGrew, 122 F.3d 847, 849-850 (CA9 1997); United States v. Williamson, 1 F.3d 1134, 1136, n. 1 (CA10 1993);United States v. Blakeney, 942 F.2d 1001, 1025-1026 (CA6 1991); United States v. Maxwell, 287 U.S. App. D.C. 234, 920 F.2d 1028, 1031 (CADC 1990); United States v. Curry, 911 F.2d 72, 76-77 (CA8 1990); United States v. Roche, 614 F.2d 6, 8 (CA1 1980).  But in this case the warrant did not incorporate other documents by reference, nor did either the affidavit or the application (which had been placed under seal) accompany the  warrant.  Hence, we need not further explore the matter of incorporation. 

 Petitioner argues that even though the warrant was invalid, the search nevertheless was "reasonable" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. He notes that a Magistrate authorized the search on the basis of adequate evidence of probable cause, that petitioner orally described to respondents the items to be seized, and that the search did not exceed the limits intended by the Magistrate and described by petitioner.  Thus, petitioner maintains, his search of respondents' ranch was functionally equivalent to a search authorized by a valid warrant. 

We disagree.  This warrant did not simply omit a few items from a list of many to be seized, or misdescribe a few of several items.  Nor did it make what fairly could be characterized as a mere technical mistake or typographical error.  Rather, in the space set aside for a description of the items to be seized, the warrant stated that the items consisted of a "single dwelling residence . . . blue in color." In other words, the warrant did not describe the items to be seized at all. In this respect the warrant was so obviously deficient that we must regard the search as "warrantless" within the meaning of our case law.  See Leon,468 U.S., at 923, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, 104 S. Ct. 3405 ; cf. Maryland v. Garrison,480 U.S. 79, 85, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72, 107 S. Ct. 1013 (1987); Steele v. United States,267 U.S. 498, 503-504, 69 L. Ed. 757, 45 S. Ct. 414 (1925).  "We are not  dealing with formalities." McDonald,335 U.S., at 455, 93 L. Ed. 153, 69 S. Ct. 191.  Because "'the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion'" stands "'[a]t the very core' of the Fourth Amendment," Kyllo v. United States,533 U.S. 27, 31, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038 (2001) (quoting Silverman v. United States,365 U.S. 505, 511, 5 L. Ed. 2d 734, 81 S. Ct. 679 (1961)), our cases have firmly established the "'basic principle of Fourth Amendment law' that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable," Payton v. New York,445 U.S. 573, 586, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639, 100 S. Ct. 1371 (1980) (footnote omitted).  Thus, "absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless entry to search for weapons or contraband is unconstitutional even when a felony has been committed and there is probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence will be found within." Id., 445 U.S. at 587-588, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639, 1010 S. Ct. 1371 (footnote omitted).  See Kyllo, 533 U.S., at 29, 150 L. Ed. 2d 94, 121 S. Ct. 2038; Illinois v. Rodriguez,497 U.S. 177, 181, 111 L. Ed. 2d 148, 110 S. Ct. 2793 (1990); Chimel v. California,395 U.S. 752, 761-763, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685, 89 S. Ct. 2034 (1969); McDonald,335 U.S., at 454, 93 L. Ed. 153, 69 S. Ct. 191; Johnson v. United States,333 U.S. 10, 92 L. Ed. 436, 68 S. Ct. 367 (1948). 

We have clearly stated that the presumptive rule against warrantless searches applies with equal force to searches whose only defect is a lack of particularity in the warrant.  In Sheppard, for instance, the petitioner argued that even though the warrant was invalid for lack of particularity, "the search was constitutional because it was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." 468 U.S., at 988, n. 5, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424.  In squarely rejecting that position, we explained: "The uniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional. Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476 [13 L. Ed. 2d 431, 85 S. Ct. 506] (1965); United States v. Cardwell, 680 F.2d 75, 77-78 (CA9 1982); United States v. Crozier, 674 F.2d 1293, 1299 (CA9 1982); United States v. Klein, 565 F.2d 183, 185 (CA1 1977); United States v. Gardner, 537 F.2d 861, 862 (CA6 1976); United States v. Marti, 421 F.2d 1263, 1268-1269 (CA2 1970).  That rule is in keeping with the well-established principle that 'except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is "unreasonable" unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.' Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 528-529 [18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 87 S. Ct. 1727] (1967).  See Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 211-212 [68 L. Ed. 2d 38, 101 S. Ct. 1642] (1981); Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493, 499 [2 L. Ed. 2d 1514, 78 S. Ct. 1253, 1958-2 C.B. 1005] (1958)." Ibid.

Petitioner asks us to hold that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant lacking particularity should be exempt from the presumption of unreasonableness if the goals served by the particularity requirement are otherwise satisfied.  He maintains that the search in this case satisfied those goals--which he says are "to prevent general searches, to prevent the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another, and to prevent warrants from being issued on vague or dubious information," Brief for Petitioner 16--because the scope of the search did not exceed the limits set forth in the application.  But unless the particular items described in the affidavit are also set forth in the warrant itself (or at least incorporated by reference, and the affidavit present at the search), there can be no written assurance that the Magistrate actually found probable cause to search for, and to seize, every item mentioned in the affidavit.  See McDonald, 335 U.S., at 455, 93 L. Ed. 153, 69 S. Ct. 191 ("Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police.  This was done . . . so that an objective mind might weigh the need to invade [the citizen's] privacy in order to enforce the law").  In this case, for example, it is at least theoretically possible that the Magistrate was satisfied that the search for weapons and explosives was justified by the showing in the affidavit, but not convinced that any evidentiary basis existed for rummaging through respondents' files and papers for receipts pertaining to the purchase or manufacture of such items.  Cf. Stanford v. Texas,379 U.S. 476, 485-486, 13 L. Ed. 2d 431, 85 S. Ct. 506 (1965).  Or, conceivably, the Magistrate might  have believed that some of the weapons mentioned in the affidavit could have been lawfully possessed and therefore should not be seized. See 26 USC § 5861 [26 USCS § 5861] (requiring registration, but not banning possession of, certain firearms).  The mere fact that the Magistrate issued a warrant does not necessarily establish that he agreed that the scope of the search should be as broad as the affiant's request.  Even though petitioner acted with restraint in conducting the search, "the inescapable fact is that this restraint was imposed by the agents  themselves, not by a judicial officer." Katz v. United States,389 U.S. 347, 356, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967). 4For this reason petitioner's argument that any constitutional error was committed by the Magistrate, not petitioner, is misplaced.  In Massachusetts v. Sheppard,468 U.S. 981, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424 (1984), we suggested that "the judge, not the police officers," may have committed "[a]n error of constitutional dimension," id., 468 U.S. at 990, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424, because the judge had assured the officers requesting the warrant that he would take the steps necessary to conform the warrant to constitutional requirements, id., 468 U.S. at 986, 82 L. Ed. 2d. 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424.  Thus, "it was not unreasonable for the police in [that] case to rely on the judge's assurances that the warrant authorized the search they had requested." Id., 468 U.S. at 990, n. 6, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424 .  In this case, by contrast, petitioner did not alert the Magistrate to the defect in the warrant that petitioner had drafted, and we therefore cannot know whether the Magistrate was aware of the scope of the search he was authorizing.  Nor would it have been reasonable for petitioner to rely on a warrant that was so patently defective, even if the Magistrate was aware of the deficiency.  See United States v. Leon,468 U.S. 897, 915, 922, n. 23, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, 104 S. Ct. 3405 (1984).

We have long held, moreover, that the purpose of the particularity requirement is not limited to the prevention of general searches.  See Garrison, 480 U.S., at 84, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72, 107 S. Ct. 1013.  A particular warrant also "assures the individual whose property is searched or seized of the lawful authority of the executing officer, his need to search, and the limits of his power to search." United States v. Chadwick,433 U.S. 1, 9, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538, 97 S. Ct. 2476 (1977) (citing Camara v. Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, 387 U.S. 523, 532, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 87 S. Ct. 1727 (1967)), abrogated on other grounds, California v. Acevedo,500 U.S. 565, 114 L. Ed. 2d 619, 111 S. Ct. 1982 (1991).  See also Illinois v. Gates,462 U.S. 213, 236, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (1983) ("[P]ossession of a warrant by officers conducting an arrest or search greatly reduces the perception of unlawful or intrusive police conduct"). 5It is true, as petitioner points out, that neither the Fourth Amendment nor Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the executing officer to serve the warrant on the owner before commencing the search.  Rule 41(f)(3) provides that "[t]he officer executing the warrant must: (A) give a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken to the person from whom, or from whose premises, the property was taken; or (B) leave a copy of the warrant and receipt at the place where the officer took the property." Quite obviously, in some circumstances--a surreptitious search by means of a wiretap, for example, or the search of empty or abandoned premises--it will be impracticable or imprudent for the officers to show the warrant in advance.  See Katz v. United States,389 U.S. 347, 355, n. 16, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576, 88 S. Ct. 507 (1967); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 37-41, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726, 83 S. Ct. 1623 (1963).  Whether it would be unreasonable to refuse a request to furnish the warrant at the outset of the search when, as in this case, an occupant of the premises is present and poses no threat to the officers' safe and effective performance of their mission, is a question that this case does not present.

 Petitioner argues that even if the goals of the particularity requirement are broader than he acknowledges, those goals nevertheless were served because he orally described to respondents the items for which he was searching. Thus, he submits, respondents had all of the notice that a proper warrant would have accorded.  But this case presents no occasion even to reach this argument, since respondents, as noted above, dispute petitioner's account.  According to Mrs. Ramirez, petitioner stated only that he was looking for an "'explosive  device in a box.'" 298 F.3d at 1026.  Because this dispute is before us on petitioner's motion for summary judgment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a, "[t]he evidence of the  nonmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in [her] favor," Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,477 U.S. 242, 255, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202, 106 S. Ct. 2505 (1986) (citation omitted).  The posture of the case therefore obliges us to credit Mrs. Ramirez's account, and we find that petitioner's description of "'an explosive device in a box'" was little better than no guidance at all.  See Stefonek, 179 F.3d at 1032-1033 (holding that a search warrant for "'evidence of crime'" was "[s]o open-ended" in its description that it could "only be described as a general warrant"). 

 It is incumbent on the officer executing a search warrant to ensure the search is lawfully authorized and lawfully conducted. 6The Court of Appeals' decision is consistent with this principle.  Petitioner mischaracterizes the court's decision when he contends that it imposed a novel proofreading requirement on officers executing warrants.  The court held that officers leading a search team must "mak[e] sure that they have a proper warrant that in fact authorizes the search and seizure they are about to conduct." 298 F.3d 1022, 1027 (CA9 2002).  That is not a duty to proofread; it is, rather, a duty to ensure that the warrant conforms to constitutional requirements. Because petitioner did not have in his possession a warrant particularly describing the things he intended to seize, proceeding with the search was clearly "unreasonable" under the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals correctly held that the search was unconstitutional. 

 III 

 Having concluded that a constitutional violation occurred, we turn to the question whether petitioner is entitled to qualified immunity despite that violation.  See Wilson v. Layne,526 U.S. 603, 609, 143 L. Ed. 2d 818, 119 S. Ct. 1692 (1999).  The answer depends on whether the right that was transgressed was "'clearly established'"--that is, "whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted." Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 202, 150 L. Ed. 2d 272, 121 S. Ct. 2151 (2001). 

 Given that the particularity requirement is set forth in the text of the Constitution, no reasonable officer could believe that a warrant that plainly did not comply with that requirement was valid.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U.S. 800, 818-819, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396, 102 S. Ct. 2727 (1982) ("If the law was clearly established, the immunity  defense ordinarily should fail, since a reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct").  Moreover, because petitioner himself prepared the invalid warrant, he may not argue that he reasonably relied on the Magistrate's assurance that the warrant contained an adequate description of the things to be seized and was therefore valid.  Cf. Sheppard, 468 U.S., at 989-990, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424.  In fact, the guidelines of petitioner's own department placed him on notice that he might be liable for executing a manifestly invalid warrant.  An ATF directive in force at the time of this search warned: "Special agents are liable if they exceed their authority while executing a search warrant and must be sure that a search warrant is sufficient on its face even when issued by a magistrate." Searches and Examinations, ATF Order O 3220.1(7)(d) (Feb. 13, 1997).  See also id., at 3220.1(23)(b) ("If any error or deficiency is discovered and there is  a reasonable probability that it will invalidate the warrant, such warrant shall not be executed.  The search shall be postponed until a satisfactory warrant has been obtained"). 7We do not suggest that an official is deprived of qualified immunity whenever he violates an internal guideline.  We refer to the ATF Order only to underscore that petitioner should have known that he should not execute a patently defective warrant. And even a cursory reading of the warrant in this case--perhaps just a simple glance--would have revealed a glaring deficiency that any reasonable police officer would have known was constitutionally fatal. 

 No reasonable officer could claim to be unaware of the basic rule, well established by our cases, that, absent consent or exigency, a warrantless search of the home is presumptively unconstitutional.  See Payton, 445 U.S., at 586-588, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639, 100 S. Ct. 1371.  Indeed, as we noted nearly 20 years ago in Sheppard: "The uniformly applied rule is that a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that fails to conform to the particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is unconstitutional." 468 U.S., at 988, n. 5, 82 L. Ed. 2d 737, 104 S. Ct. 3424. 8Although both Sheppard and Leon involved the application of the "good faith" exception to the Fourth Amendment's general exclusionary rule, we have explained that "the same standard of objective reasonableness that we applied in the context of a suppression hearing in Leon defines the qualified immunity accorded an officer." Malley v. Briggs,475 U.S. 335, 344, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271, 106 S. Ct. 1092 (1986) (citation omitted). Because not a word in any of our cases would suggest to a reasonable officer that this case fits within any exception to that fundamental tenet, petitioner is asking us, in effect, to craft a new exception.  Absent any support for such an exception in our cases, he cannot reasonably have relied on an expectation that we would do so. 

 Petitioner contends that the search in this case was the product, at worst, of a lack of due care, and that our case law requires more than negligent behavior before depriving an official of qualified immunity. See Malley v. Briggs,475 U.S. 335, 341, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271, 106 S. Ct. 1092 (1986).  But as we observed in the companion case to Sheppard, "a warrant may be so facially deficient--i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized--that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid." Leon,468 U.S., at 923, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, 104 S. Ct. 3405 .  This is such a case. 9 Justice Kennedy argues in dissent that we have not allowed "'ample room for mistaken judgments,'" post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1087 (quoting Malley, 475 U.S., at 343, 89 L. Ed. 2d 271, 106 S. Ct. 1092), because "difficult and important tasks demand the officer's full attention in the heat of an ongoing and often dangerous criminal investigation," post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1085.  In this case, however, petitioner does not contend that any sort of exigency existed when he drafted the affidavit, the warrant application, and the warrant, or when he conducted the search.  This is not the situation, therefore, in which we have recognized that "officers in the dangerous and difficult process of making arrests and executing search warrants" require "some latitude." Maryland v. Garrison,480 U.S. 79, 87, 94 L. Ed. 2d 72, 107 S. Ct. 1013 (1987). Nor are we according "the correctness of paper forms" a higher status than "substantive rights." Post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1087.  As we have explained, the Fourth Amendment's particularity requirement assures the subject of the search that a magistrate has duly authorized the officer to conduct a search of limited scope.  This substantive right is not protected when the officer fails to take the time to glance at the authorizing document and detect a glaring defect that Justice Kennedy agrees is of constitutional magnitude, post, at ____, 157 L. Ed. 2d, at 1084.

    Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. 

It is so ordered.  


Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The State of Washington established the Promise Scholarship Program to assist academically gifted students with postsecondary education expenses.  In accordance with the State Constitution, students may not use the scholarship at an institution where they are pursuing a degree in devotional theology. We hold that such an exclusion from an otherwise inclusive aid program does not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.

The Washington State Legislature found that "[s]tudents who work hard . . . and successfully complete high school with high academic marks may not have the financial ability to attend college because they cannot obtain financial aid or the financial aid is insufficient." Wash. Rev. Code § 28B.119.005 (Supp. 2004).  In 1999, to assist these high-achieving students, the legislature created the  Promise Scholarship Program, which provides a scholarship, renewable for one year, to eligible students for postsecondary education expenses.  Students may spend their funds on any education-related expense, including room and board.  The scholarships are funded through the State's general fund, and their amount varies each year depending on the annual appropriation, which is evenly prorated among the eligible students.  Wash. Admin. Code § 250-80-050(2) (2003).  The scholarship was worth $1,125 for academic year 1999-2000 and $1,542 for 2000-2001. 

To be eligible for the scholarship, a student must meet academic, income, and enrollment requirements.  A student must graduate from a Washington public or private high school and either graduate in the top 15% of his graduating class, or attain on the first attempt a cumulative score of 1,200 or better on the Scholastic Assessment Test I or a score of  27 or better on the American College Test.  §§ 250-80-020(12)(a) -- (d).  The student's family income must be less than 135% of the State's median.  § 250-80-020(12)(e).  Finally, the student must enroll "at least half time in an eligible postsecondary institution in the state of Washington," and may not pursue a degree in theology at that institution while receiving the scholarship.  §§ 250-80-020(12)(f) -- (g); see also Wash. Rev. Code § 28B.10.814 (1997) ("No aid shall be awarded to any student who is pursuing a degree in theology").  Private institutions, including those religiously affiliated, qualify as "eligible postsecondary institution[s]" if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body.  See Wash. Admin. Code § 250-80-020(13).  A "degree in theology" is not defined in the statute, but, as both parties concede, the statute simply codifies the State's constitutional prohibition on providing funds to students to pursue degrees that are "devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith." Brief for Petitioners 6; Brief for Respondent 8; see also Wash. Const., Art. I, § 11. 

A student who applies for the scholarship and meets the academic and income requirements is notified that he is eligible for the scholarship if he meets the enrollment requirements.  E.g., App. 95.  Once the student enrolls at an eligible institution, the institution must certify that the student is enrolled at least half time and that the student is not pursuing a degree in devotional theology. The institution, rather than the State, determines whether the student's major is devotional. Id., at 126, 131.  If the student meets the enrollment requirements, the scholarship funds are sent to the institution for distribution to the student to pay for tuition or other educational expenses.  See Wash. Admin. Code § 250-80-060. 

Respondent, Joshua Davey, was awarded a Promise Scholarship, and chose to attend Northwest College.  Northwest is a private, Christian college affiliated with the Assemblies of God denomination, and is an eligible institution under the Promise Scholarship Program.  Davey had "planned for many years to attend a Bible college and to prepare [himself] through that college training for a lifetime of ministry, specifically as a church pastor." App. 40.  To that end, when he enrolled in Northwest College, he decided to pursue a double major in pastoral ministries and business management/administration.  Id., at 43.  There is no dispute that the pastoral ministries degree is devotional and therefore excluded under the Promise Scholarship Program. 

At the beginning of the 1999-2000 academic year, Davey met with Northwest's director of financial aid. He learned for the first time at this meeting that he could not use his scholarship to pursue a devotional theology degree.  He was informed that to receive the funds appropriated for his use, he must certify in writing that he was not pursuing such a degree at Northwest. 1The State does not require students to certify anything or sign any forms.  App. 86, 89. He refused to sign the form and did not receive any scholarship funds. 

 Davey then brought an action under 42 USC § 1983 [42 USCS § 1983] against various state officials (hereinafter State) in the District Court for the Western District of Washington to enjoin the State from refusing to award the scholarship solely because  a student is pursuing a devotional theology degree, and for damages.  He argued the denial of his scholarship based on his decision to pursue a theology degree violated, inter alia, the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After the District Court denied Davey's request for a preliminary injunction, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  The District Court rejected Davey's constitutional claims and granted summary judgment in favor of the State. 

A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  299 F.3d 748 (2002).  The court concluded that the State had singled out religion for unfavorable treatment and thus under our decision in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,508 U.S. 520, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993), the State's exclusion of theology majors must be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.  299 F.3d, at 757-758.  Finding that the State's own antiestablishment concerns were not compelling, the court declared Washington's Promise Scholarship Program unconstitutional. Id., at 760.  We granted certiorari, 538 U.S. 1031, 155 L. Ed. 2d 1059, 123 S. Ct. 2075 (2003), and now reverse. 

 The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment provide: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." These two Clauses, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause, are frequently in tension.  See Norwood v. Harrison,413 U.S. 455, 469, 37 L. Ed. 2d 723, 93 S. Ct. 2804 (1973) (citing Tilton v. Richardson,403 U.S. 672, 677, 29 L. Ed. 2d 790, 91 S. Ct. 2091 (1971)).  Yet we have long said that "there is room for play in the joints" between them.  Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York,397 U.S. 664, 669, 25 L. Ed. 2d 697, 90 S. Ct. 1409 (1970).  In  other words, there are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause. 

 This case involves that "play in the joints" described above. Under our Establishment Clause precedent, the link between government funds and religious training is broken by the independent and private choice of recipients.  See Zelman v. Simmons-Harris,536 U.S. 639, 652, 153 L. Ed. 2d 604, 122 S. Ct. 2460 (2002); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,509 U.S. 1, 13-14, 125 L. Ed. 2d 1, 113 S. Ct. 2462 (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind,474 U.S. 481, 487, 88 L. Ed. 2d 846, 106 S. Ct. 748 (1986); Mueller v. Allen,463 U.S. 388, 399-400, 77 L. Ed. 2d 721, 103 S. Ct. 3062 (1983).  As such, there is no doubt that the State could, consistent with the Federal Constitution, permit Promise Scholars to pursue a degree in devotional theology, see Witters, supra, at 489, 88 L. Ed. 2d 846, 106 S. Ct. 748 , and the State does not contend otherwise.  The question before us, however, is whether Washington, pursuant to its own constitution, 2The relevant provision of the Washington Constitution, Art. I, § 11, states: "Religious Freedom.  Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment, belief and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one shall be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state.  No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious worship, exercise or instruction, or the support of any religious establishment." which has been  authoritatively interpreted as prohibiting even indirectly funding religious instruction that will prepare students for the ministry, see Witters v. Commission for Blind, 112 Wn.2d 363, 369-370, 771 P.2d 1119, 1122 (1989); cf. Witters v. State Comm'n for the Blind, 102 Wn. 2d 624, 629, 689 P.2d 53, 56 (1984) ("It is not the role of the State to pay for the religious education of future ministers"), rev'd, 474 U.S. 481, 88 L. Ed. 2d 846, 106 S. Ct. 748,supra, can deny them such funding without violating the Free Exercise Clause. 

 Davey urges us to answer that question in the negative.  He contends that under the rule we enunciated in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, supra, the program is presumptively unconstitutional because it is not facially neutral with respect to religion. 3 Davey, relying on Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510 (1995), contends that the Promise Scholarship Program is an unconstitutional viewpoint restriction on speech.  But the Promise Scholarship Program is not a forum for speech.  The purpose of the Promise Scholarship Program is to assist students from low- and middle-income families with the cost of postsecondary education, not to "'encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.'" United States v. Am. Library Ass'n, 539 U.S. 194, 206, 156 L. Ed. 2d 221, 123 S. Ct. 2297 (2003) (plurality opinion) (quoting Rosenberger, supra, at 834, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510 ).  Our cases dealing with speech forums are simply inapplicable.  See American Library Ass'n, supra; Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc.,473 U.S. 788, 805, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567, 105 S. Ct. 3439 (1985).  Davey also argues that the Equal Protection Clause protects against discrimination on the basis of religion. Because we hold, infra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 9, that the program is not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause, however, we apply rational-basis scrutiny to his equal protection claims. Johnson v. Robison,415 U.S. 361, 375, n. 14, 39 L. Ed. 2d 389, 94 S. Ct. 1160 (1974); see also McDaniel v. Paty,435 U.S. 618, 55 L. Ed. 2d 593, 98 S. Ct. 1322 (1978) (reviewing religious discrimination claim under the Free Exercise Clause).  For the reasons stated herein, the program passes such review. We reject his claim of presumptive unconstitutionality, however; to do otherwise would extend the Lukumi line of cases well beyond not only their facts but their reasoning.  In Lukumi, the city of Hialeah made it a crime to engage in certain kinds of animal slaughter.  We found that the law sought to suppress ritualistic animal sacrifices of the Santeria religion. 508 U.S., at 535, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472, 113 S. Ct. 2217.  In the present case, the State's disfavor of religion (if it can be called that) is of a far milder kind.  It imposes neither criminal nor civil sanctions on any type of religious service or rite.  It does not deny to ministers the right to participate in the political affairs of the community.  See McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 55 L. Ed. 2d 593, 98 S. Ct. 1322 (1978).  And it does not require students to choose between their religious beliefs and  receiving a government benefit. 4 Promise Scholars may still use their scholarship to pursue a secular degree at a different institution from where they are studying devotional theology. See ibid.; Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla.,480 U.S. 136, 94 L. Ed. 2d 190, 107 S. Ct. 1046 (1987); Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,450 U.S. 707, 67 L. Ed. 2d 624, 101 S. Ct. 1425 (1981); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 10 L. Ed. 2d 965, 83 S. Ct. 1790 (1963).  The State has merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction. 

 Justice Scalia argues, however, that generally available benefits are part of the "baseline against which burdens on religion are measured." Post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 13 (dissenting opinion).  Because the Promise Scholarship Program funds training for all secular professions, Justice Scalia contends the State must also fund training for religious professions. See ibid. But training for religious professions and training for secular professions are not fungible.  Training someone to lead a congregation is an essentially religious endeavor.  Indeed, majoring in devotional theology is akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit.  See Calvary Bible Presbyterian Church v. Board of Regents, 72 Wn. 2d 912, 919, 436 P.2d 189, 193 (1967) (holding public funds may not be expended for "that category of instruction that resembles worship and manifests a devotion to religion and religious principles in thought, feeling, belief, and conduct"); App. 40 (Davey stating his "religious beliefs [were] the only reason for [him] to seek a college degree").  And the subject of religion is one in which both the United States and state constitutions embody distinct views--in favor of free exercise, but opposed to establishment--that find no counterpart with respect to other callings or professions. That a State would deal differently with religious education for the ministry than with education for other callings is a product of these views, not evidence of hostility toward religion. 

Even though the differently worded Washington Constitution draws a more stringent line than that drawn by the United States Constitution, the interest it seeks to further is scarcely novel.  In fact, we can think of few areas in which a State's antiestablishment interests come more into play. 5Justice Scalia notes that the State's "philosophical preference" to protect individual conscience is potentially without limit, see post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 15; however, the only interest at issue here is the State's interest in not funding the religious training of clergy. Nothing in our opinion suggests that the State may justify any interest that its "philosophical preference" commands. Since the founding of our country, there have been popular uprisings against procuring taxpayer funds to support church leaders, which was one of the hallmarks of an "established" religion. 6Perhaps the most famous example of public backlash is the defeat of "A Bill Establishing A Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion" in the Virginia Legislature.  The bill sought to assess a tax for "Christian teachers," reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,330 U.S. 1, 74, 91 L. Ed. 711, 67 S. Ct. 504 (1947) (supplemental appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.); see also Rosenberger, supra, at 853, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700, 115 S. Ct. 2510  (Thomas, J., concurring) (purpose of the bill was to support "clergy in the performance of their function of teaching religion"), and was rejected after a public outcry.  In its stead, the "Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty," which was originally written by Thomas Jefferson, was enacted.  This bill guaranteed "that no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever." A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 2 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 546 (J. Boyd ed. 1950). See R. Butts, The American Tradition in Religion and Education 15-17, 19-20, 26-37 (1950); F. Lambert, The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion inAmerica 188 (2003) ("In defending their religious liberty against overreaching clergy, Americans in all regions found that Radical Whig ideas best framed their  argument that state-supported clergy undermined liberty of conscience and should be opposed"); see also J. Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,330 U.S. 1, 65, 68, 91 L. Ed. 711, 67 S. Ct. 504 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.) (noting the dangers to civil liberties from supporting clergy with public funds). 

 Most States that sought to avoid an establishment of religion around the time of the founding placed in their constitutions formal prohibitions against using tax funds to support the ministry. E.g., Ga. Const., Art. IV, § 5 (1789), reprinted in 2 Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial Charters and Other Organic Laws 789 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909) (reprinted 1993) ("All persons shall have the free exercise of religion, without being obliged to contribute to the support of any religious profession but their own"); Pa. Const., Art. II (1776) in 5 id., at 3082 ("[N]o man ought or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and consent"); N. J. Const., Art. XVIII (1776), in id., at 2597 (similar); Del. Const., Art. I, § 1 (1792), in 1 id., at 568 (similar); Ky. Const., Art. XII, § 3 (1792), in 3 id., at 1274 (similar); Vt. Const., Ch. I, Art. 3 (1793), in 6 id., at 3762 (similar); Tenn. Const., Art. XI, § 3 (1796), in id., at 3422 (similar); Ohio Const., Art. VIII, § 3 (1802), in 5 id., at 2910 (similar).  The plain text of these constitutional provisions prohibited any tax dollars from supporting the clergy. We have found nothing to indicate, as Justice Scalia contends, post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 14, that these provisions would not have applied so long as the State equally supported other professions or if the amount at stake was de minimis.That early state constitutions saw no problem in explicitly excluding only the ministry from receiving state dollars reinforces our conclusion that religious instruction is of a different ilk. 7The amici contend that Washington's Constitution was born of religious bigotry because it contains a so-called "Blaine Amendment," which has been linked with anti-Catholicism.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23, n 5; Brief for Becket Fund for Religious Liberty et al. as Amici Curiae; see also Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.S. 793, 828, 147 L. Ed. 2d 660, 120 S. Ct. 2530 (2000) (plurality opinion).  As the State notes and Davey does not dispute, however, the provision in question is not a Blaine Amendment.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 5; see Reply Brief for Petitioners 6-7.  The enabling Act of 1889, which authorized the drafting of the Washington Constitution, required the state constitution to include a provision "for the establishment and maintenance of systems of public schools, which shall be . . . free from sectarian control." Act of Feb. 22, 1889, ch 180, § 4, P Fourth, 25 Stat 676.  This provision was included in Article IX, § 4, of the Washington Constitution ("All schools maintained and supported wholly or in part by the public funds shall be forever free from sectarian control or influence"), and is not at issue in this case.  Neither Davey nor amici have established a credible connection between the Blaine Amendment and Article I, § 11, the relevant constitutional provision.  Accordingly, the Blaine Amendment's history is simply not before us.

Far from evincing the hostility toward religion which was manifest in Lukumi, we believe that the entirety of the Promise Scholarship Program goes a long way toward including religion in its benefits. 8Washington has also been solicitous in ensuring that its constitution is not hostile towards religion, see State ex rel. Gallwey v. Grimm, 146 Wn. 2d 445, 470, 48 P. 3d 274, 286 (2002) ("[I]t was never the intention that our constitution should be construed in any manner indicating any hostility toward religion." (citation omitted)), and at least in some respects, its constitution provides greater protection of religious liberties than the Free Exercise Clause, see First Covenant Church of Seattle v. Seattle, 120 Wn. 2d 203, 223-229, 840 P.2d 174, 186-188 (1992) (rejecting standard in Employment Div. v. Smith,494 U.S. 872, 108 L. Ed. 2d 876, 110 S. Ct. 1595 (1990), in favor of more protective rule); Munns v. Martin, 131 Wn. 2d 192, 201, 930 P.2d 318, 322 (1997) (holding a city ordinance that imposed controls on demolition of historic structures inapplicable to the Catholic Church's plan to demolish an old school building and build a new pastoral center because the facilities are intimately associated with the church's religious mission).  We have found nothing in Washington's overall approach that indicates it "single[s] out" anyone "for special burdens on the basis of . . . religious callings" as Justice Scalia contends, post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 16.  The program permits students to attend pervasively  religious schools, so long as they are accredited. As Northwest advertises, its "concept of education is distinctly Christian in the evangelical sense." App. 168.  It prepares all of its students, "through instruction, through modeling, [and] through [its] classes, to use . . . the Bible as their guide, as the truth," no matter their chosen  profession. Id., at 169.  And under the Promise Scholarship Program's current guidelines, students are still eligible to take devotional theology courses. 9The State notes that it is an open question as to whether the Washington Constitution prohibits nontheology majors from taking devotional theology courses.  At this point, however, the Program guidelines only exclude students who are pursuing a theology degree.  Wash. Admin. Code § 250-80-020(12)(g) (2003). Davey notes all students at Northwest are required to take at least four devotional courses, "Exploring the Bible," "Principles of Spiritual Development," "Evangelism in the Christian Life," and "Christian Doctrine," Brief for Respondent 11, n 5; see also App. 151, and some students may have additional religious requirements as part of their majors.  Brief for Respondent 11, n 5; see also App. 150-151. 

In short, we find neither in the history or text of Article I, § 11 of the Washington Constitution, nor in the operation of the Promise Scholarship Program, anything that suggests animus towards religion. 10Although we have sometimes characterized the Establishment Clause as prohibiting the State from disapproving "of a particular religion or religion in general," Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah,508 U.S. 520, 532, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993) (citing cases), for the reasons noted supra, the State has not impermissibly done so here. Given the historic and substantial state interest at issue, we therefore cannot conclude that the denial of funding for vocational religious instruction alone is inherently constitutionally suspect. 

 Without a presumption of unconstitutionality, Davey's claim must fail.  The State's interest in not funding the pursuit of devotional degrees is substantial and the exclusion of such funding places a relatively minor burden on Promise Scholars.  If any room exists between the two Religion Clauses, it must be here.  We need not venture further into this difficult area in order to uphold the Promise Scholarship Program as currently operated by the State of Washington. 

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed.  


Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Before seeking a federal writ of habeas corpus, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1) [28 USCS § 2254(b)(1)], thereby giving the State the "'opportunity to pass upon and correct' alleged violations of its prisoners' federal rights." Duncan v. Henry, 513 U.S. 364, 365, 130 L. Ed. 2d 865, 115 S. Ct. 887 (1995)(per curiam) (quoting Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275, 30 L. Ed. 2d 438, 92 S. Ct. 509 (1971)  (citation omitted)).  To provide the State with the necessary "opportunity," the prisoner must "fairly present" his claim in each appropriate state court (including a state supreme court with powers of discretionary review), thereby alerting that court to the federal nature of the claim.  Duncan, supra, at 365-366, 130 L. Ed. 2d 865, 115 S. Ct. 887; O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845, 144 L. Ed. 2d 1, 119 S. Ct. 1728 (1999).  This case focuses upon the requirement of "fair presentation." 

I 

Michael Reese, the respondent, appealed his state court kidnaping and attempted sodomy convictions and sentences through Oregon's state court system.  He then brought collateral relief proceedings in the state courts (where he was represented by appointed counsel).  After the lower  courts denied him collateral relief, Reese filed a petition for discretionary review in the Oregon Supreme Court. 

The petition made several different legal claims.  In relevant part, the petition asserted that Reese had received "ineffective assistance of both trial court and appellate court counsel." App. 47.  The petition added that "his imprisonment is in violation of [Oregon state law]." Id., at 48.  It said that his trial counsel's conduct violated several provisions of the Federal Constitution.  Ibid. But it did not say that his separate appellate "ineffective assistance" claim violated federal law. The Oregon Supreme Court denied review. 

Reese ultimately sought a federal writ of habeas corpus, raising, among other claims, a federal constitutional claim that his appellate counsel did not effectively represent him during one of his direct state court appeals.  The Federal District Court held that Reese had not "fairly presented" his federal "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" claim to the higher state courts because his brief in the state appeals court had not indicated that he was complaining about a violation of federal law. 

A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court.282 F.3d 1184 (2002).  Although the majority apparently believed that Reese's petition itself did not alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of the appellate "ineffective assistance" claim, it did not find that fact determinative.  Id., at 1193-1194 .  Rather, it found that Reese had satisfied the "fair presentation" requirement because the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court had had "the opportunity to read . . . the lower [Oregon] court decision claimed to be in error before deciding whether to grant discretionary review." Id., at 1194 (emphasis added). Had they read the opinion of the lower state trial court, the majority added, the justices would have, or should have, realized that Reese's claim rested upon federal law. Ibid.

We granted certiorari to determine whether the Ninth Circuit has correctly interpreted the "fair presentation" requirement. 

II 

 We begin by assuming that Reese's petition by itself did not properly alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of Reese's claim.  On that assumption, Reese failed to meet the "fair presentation" standard, and the Ninth Circuit was wrong to hold the contrary. 

 We recognize that the justices of the Oregon Supreme Court did have an "opportunity" to read the lower court opinions in Reese's case.  That opportunity means that the judgescould have read them.  But to say that a petitioner "fairly presents" a federal claim when an appellate judge can discover that claim only by reading lower court opinions in the case is to say that those judges must read the lower court opinions--for otherwise they would forfeit the State's opportunity to decide that federal claim in the first instance.  In our view, federal habeas corpus law does not impose such a requirement. 

 For one thing, the requirement would force state appellate judges to alter their ordinary review practices.  Appellate judges, of course, will often read lower court opinions, but they do not necessarily do so in every case.  Sometimes an appellate  court can decide a legal question on the basis of the briefs alone.  That is particularly so where the question at issue is whether to exercise a discretionary power of review, i.e., whether to review the merits of a lower court decision.  In such instances, the nature of the issue may matter more than does the legal validity of the lower court decision.  And the nature of the issue alone may lead the court to decide not to hear the case.  Indeed,  the Oregon Supreme Court is a court with a discretionary power of review.  And Oregon Rule of Appellate Procedure 9.05(7) (2003) instructs litigants seeking discretionary review to identify clearly in the petition itself the legal questions presented, why those questions have special importance, a short statement of relevant facts, and the reasons for reversal, "including appropriate authorities." 

 For another thing, the opinion-reading requirement would impose a serious burden upon judges of state appellate courts, particularly those with discretionary review powers.  Those courts have heavy workloads, which would be significantly increased if their judges had to read through lower court opinions or briefs in every instance.  See National Center for State Courts, State Courts Caseload Statistics 2002, pp 106-110 (Table 2) (for example, in 2001, Oregon appellate courts received a total of 5,341 appeals, including 908 petitions for discretionary review to its Supreme Court; California appellate courts received 32,273, including 8,860 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Louisiana appellate courts received 13,117, including 3,230 discretionary Supreme Court petitions; Illinois appellate courts received 12,411, including 2,325 discretionary Supreme Court petitions). 

Finally, we do not find such a requirement necessary to avoid imposing unreasonable procedural burdens upon state prisoners who may eventually seek habeas corpus.  A litigant wishing to raise a federal issue can easily indicate the federal law basis for his claim in a state court petition or brief, for example, by citing in conjunction with the claim the federal source of law on which he relies or a case deciding such a claim on federal grounds, or by simply labeling the claim "federal." 

For these reasons, we believe that the requirement imposed by the Ninth Circuit would unjustifiably undercut the considerations of federal-state comity that the exhaustion requirement seeks to promote.  We consequently hold that ordinarily a state prisoner does not "fairly present" a claim to a state court if that court must read beyond a petition or a brief (or a similar document) that does not alert it to the presence of a federal claim in order to find material, such as a lower court opinion in the case, that does so. 

III 

 Reese argues in the alternative that it is wrong to assume that his petition by itself failed to alert the Oregon Supreme Court to the federal nature of his "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" claim.  We do not agree. 

 Reese must concede that his petition does not explicitly say that the words "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" refer to a federal claim. The petition refers to provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to other claims but not in respect  to this one.  The petition provides no citation of any case that might have alerted the court to the alleged federal nature of the claim.  And the petition does not even contain a factual description supporting the claim.  Cf. Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 163, 135 L. Ed. 2d 457, 116 S. Ct. 2074 (1996); Duncan, 513 U.S., at 366, 130 L. Ed. 2d 865, 115 S. Ct. 887. 

Reese asserts that the petition nonetheless "fairly presents" a federal "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" claim for two reasons.  First, he says that the word "ineffective" is a term of art in Oregon that refers only to federal-law claims and not to similar state law claims, which, he adds, in Oregon are solely referred to as "inadequate assistance" claims.  And thus the Oregon Supreme Court should have known, from his use of the word "ineffective," that his claim was federal. 

Reese, however, has not demonstrated that Oregon law uses the words "ineffective assistance" in the manner he suggests, that is, as referring only to a federal-law claim.  See, e.g., Lichau v. Baldwin, 166 Ore. App. 411, 415, 417, 999 P.2d 1207, 1210, 1211 (2000) (using "ineffective assistance" to refer to violations of the Oregon Constitution), rev'd in part, 333 Ore. 350, 39 P. 3d 851 (2002).  Indeed, Reese's own petition uses both phrases--"ineffective assistance" and "inadequate assistance"--at different points to refer to what is apparently a single claim. 

 Second, Reese says that in Oregon the standards for adjudicating state and federal "inadequate/ineffective appellate assistance" claims are identical. He adds that, where that identity exists, a petitioner need not indicate a claim's federal nature, because, by raising a state law claim, he would necessarily "fairly present" the corresponding federal claim. 

However, the Ninth Circuit did not address this argument, and our reading of the briefs filed in the Ninth Circuit leads us to conclude that Reese did not there seek consideration of the argument in that court.  Indeed, the argument first made its appearance in this Court in Reese's brief on the merits.  Under this Court's Rule 15.2, "a nonjurisdictional argument not raised in a respondent's brief in opposition to a petition for a writ of certiorari may be deemed waived." Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 75, n. 13, 136 L. Ed. 2d 437, 117 S. Ct. 467 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This argument falls squarely within the rule.  The complex nature of Reese's claim and its broad implications suggest that its consideration by the lower courts would help in its resolution.  Hence, without expressing any view on the merits of the issue, we exercise our Rule 15.2 discretion and deem the argument waived in this Court.  See, e.g., Roberts v. Galen of Va., Inc., 525 U.S. 249, 253-254, 142 L. Ed. 2d 648, 119 S. Ct. 685 (1999)(per curiam); South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama, 526 U.S. 160, 171, 143 L. Ed. 2d 258, 119 S. Ct. 1180 (1999); cf. Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, 537 U.S. 51, 56, n. 4, 154 L. Ed. 2d 466, 123 S. Ct. 518 (2002). 

For these reasons the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 This case presents a question on which federal courts have divided:  Does the working owner of a business (here, the sole shareholder and president of a professional corporation) qualify as a "participant" in a pension plan covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or Act), 88 Stat 832, as amended, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. [29 USCS §§ 1001 et seq.]. The answer, we hold, is yes: If the plan covers one or more employees other than the business owner and his or her spouse, the working owner may participate on equal terms with other plan participants.  Such a working owner, in common with other employees, qualifies for the protections ERISA affords plan participants and is governed by the rights and remedies ERISA specifies.  In so ruling, we reject the position, taken by the lower courts in this case, that a business owner may rank only as an "employer" and not also as an "employee" for purposes of ERISA-sheltered plan participation.

Enacted "to protect . . . the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries," 29 U.S.C. § 1001(b) [29 USCS § 1001(b)], ERISA comprises four titles.  Title I, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq [29 USCS §§ 1001 et seq.], "requires administrators of all covered pension plans to file periodic reports with the Secretary of Labor, mandates minimum participation, vesting and funding schedules, establishes standards of fiduciary conduct for plan administrators, and provides for civil and criminal enforcement of the Act." Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,446 U.S. 359, 361, n. 1, 64 L. Ed. 2d 354, 100 S. Ct. 1723 (1980).  Title II, codified in various parts of Title 26 of the United States Code, "amended various [Internal Revenue Code] provisions . . . pertaining to qualification of pension plans for special tax treatment, in order, among other things, to conform to the standards set forth in Title I." 446 U.S., at 361, n. 1, 64 L. Ed. 2d 354, 100 S. Ct. 1723.  Title  III, 29 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq. [29 USCS §§ 1201 et  seq.], "contains provisions designed to coordinate enforcement efforts of different federal departments, and provides for further study of [benefit plans]." 446 U.S., at 361, n. 1, 64 L. Ed. 2d 354, 100 S. Ct. 1723.  Title IV, 29 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq. [29 USCS §§ 1301 et seq.], "created the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) and a termination insurance program to protect employees against the loss of 'nonforfeitable' benefits upon termination of pension plans that lack sufficient funds to pay such benefits in full." 446 U.S., at 361, n. 1, 64 L. Ed. 2d 354, 100 S. Ct. 1723.  See also Mead Corp. v. Tilley,490 U.S. 714, 717, 104 L. Ed. 2d 796, 109 S. Ct. 2156 (1989); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 2. 

This case concerns the definition and coverage provisions of Title I, though those provisions, indicating who may participate in an ERISA-sheltered plan, inform each of ERISA's four titles.  Title I defines the term "employee benefit plan" to encompass "an employee welfare benefit plan or an employee pension benefit plan or a plan which is both . . . ." 29 U.S.C. § 1002(3) [29 USCS § 1002(3)].  The same omnibus section defines "participant" as "any employee or former employee of an employer, . . . who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer . . ., or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit." § 1002(7).  "Employee," under Title I's definition section, means "any individual employed by an employer," § 1002(6), and "employer" includes "any person acting directly as an employer, or indirectly in the interest of an employer, in relation to an employee benefit plan, " § 1002(5). 

B 

Dr. Raymond B. Yates was the sole shareholder and president of Raymond B. Yates, M.D., P.C., a professional corporation.  287 F.3d 521, 524 (CA6 2002); App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a.  The corporation maintained the Raymond B. Yates, M.D., P.C. Profit Sharing Plan (Profit Sharing Plan or Plan), for which Yates was the administrator and trustee. Ibid. From the Profit Sharing Plan's inception, at least one person other than Yates or his wife was a participant. Ibid.; App. 269a.  The Profit Sharing Plan qualified for favorable tax treatment under § 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  287 F.3d at 524; App. 71a-73a.  As required by both the IRC, 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(13) [26 USCS § 401(a)(13)], and Title I of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d) [29 USCS § 1056(d)], the Plan contained an anti-alienation provision.  That provision, entitled "Spendthrift Clause," stated in relevant part: "Except for . . . loans to Participants as [expressly provided for in the Plan], no benefit or interest available hereunder will be subject to assignment or alienation, either voluntarily or involuntarily." App. 252a. 

In December 1989, Yates borrowed $20,000 at 11 percent interest from the Raymond B. Yates, M.D., P.C. Money Purchase Pension Plan (Money Purchase Pension Plan), which later merged into the Profit Sharing Plan. Id., at 268a-269a.  The terms of the loan agreement required Yates to make monthly payments of $433.85 over the five-year period of the loan.  Id., at 269a.  Yates failed to make any monthly payment.  287 F.3d at 524.  In June 1992, coinciding  with the Money Purchase Pension Plan-Profit Sharing Plan merger, Yates renewed the loan for five years.  App. 269a.  Again, he made no monthly payments.  In fact, Yates repaid nothing until November 1996.  287 F.3d at 524.  That month, he used the proceeds from the sale of his house to make two payments totaling $50,467.46, which paid off in full the principal and interest due on the loan.  Ibid. Yates maintained that, after the repayment, his interest in the Profit Sharing Plan amounted to about $87,000.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a. 

Three weeks after Yates repaid the loan to the Profit Sharing Plan, on December 2, 1996, Yates's creditors filed an involuntary petition against him under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Id., at 12a; accord, App.  300a.  In August 1998, respondent William T. Hendon, the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a complaint, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. §§ 547(b) and 550 [11 USCS §§ 547(b) and 550], against petitioners Profit Sharing Plan and Yates, in his capacity as the Plan's trustee.  App. 1a-3a.  Hendon asked the Bankruptcy Court to "avoi[d] the . . . preferential transfer by [Yates] to [the Profit Sharing Plan] in the amount of $50,467.46 and [to] orde[r] [the Plan and Yates, as trustee] to pay over to the [bankruptcy] trustee the sum of $50,467.46, plus legal interest . . ., together with costs . . . ." Id., at 3a.  On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Bankruptcy Court ruled for Trustee Hendon.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a-50a. 

The Bankruptcy Court first determined that the loan repayment qualified as a preferential transfer under 11 U.S.C. § 547(b) [11 USCS § 547(b)]. 1Subsection 547(b) provides: "Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property-- "(1) to or for the benefit of a creditor; "(2) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before such transfer was made; "(3) made while the debtor was insolvent; "(4) made-- "(A) on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; or "(B) between ninety days and one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if such creditor at the time of such transfer was an insider; and "(5) that enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if-- "(A) the case were a case under chapter 7 of this title; "(B) the transfer had not been made; and "(C) such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title." This provision permits the bankruptcy trustee to avoid certain transfers of "property that would have been part of the [bankruptcy] estate had it not been transferred before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings." Begier v. IRS,496 U.S. 53, 58, 110 L. Ed. 2d 46, 110 S. Ct. 2258 (1990). App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a-42a.  That finding was not challenged on appeal.  The Bankruptcy Court then held that the Profit Sharing Plan and Yates, as trustee, could not rely on the Plan's anti-alienation provision to prevent Hendon from recovering the loan repayment. As "a self-employed  owner of the professional corporation that sponsor[ed] the pension plan," the Bankruptcy Court stated, Yates could not "participate as an employee under ERISA and . . . [therefore could not] use its provisions to enforce the restriction on the transfer of his beneficial interest  in the Defendant Plan." Id., at 43a-44a.  In so ruling, the Bankruptcy Court relied on Circuit precedent, including SEC v. Johnston, 143 F.3d 260 (CA6 1998), and Fugarino v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co., 969 F.2d 178 (CA6 1992). 

The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's judgment.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a-35a.  Acknowledging that other Courts of Appeals had reached a different conclusion, id., at 19a, the District Court observed that it was bound by Sixth Circuit precedent.  According to the controlling Sixth Circuit decisions, neither a sole proprietor, Fugarino, 969 F.2d at 186, nor a sole owner of a corporation, Agrawal v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 205 F.3d 297, 302 (2000), qualifies as a "participant" in an ERISA-sheltered employee benefit plan. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a-21a.  Applying Circuit precedent, the District Court concluded: "The fact Dr. Yates was not qualified to participate in an ERISA protected plan means none of the money he contributed to the Plan as an 'employee' was ever part of an ERISA plan.  The $50,467.46 he returned to the Plan was not protected by ERISA, because none of the money he had in the Plan was protected by ERISA." Id., at 20a.

The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment.  287 F.3d 521.  The Court of Appeals adhered to its "published caselaw [holding] that 'a sole proprietor or sole shareholder of a business must be considered an employer and not an employee . . . for purposes of ERISA.'" Id., at 525 (quoting Fugarino, 969 F.2d at 186).  "[T]he spendthrift clause in the Yates profit sharing/pension plan," the appeals court accordingly ruled, "[was] not enforceable by Dr. Yates under  ERISA." 287 F.3d at 526.  The Sixth Circuit's determination that Yates was not a "participant" in the Profit Sharing Plan for ERISA purposes obviated the question whether, had Yates qualified as such a participant, his loan repayment would have been shielded from the Bankruptcy Trustee's reach.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a. 

 We granted certiorari, 539 U.S.    , 540 U.S. 964, 157 L. Ed. 2d 308, 124 S. Ct. 461 (2003), in view of the division of opinion among the Circuits on the question whether a working owner may qualify as a participant in an employee benefit plan covered by ERISA.  Compare Agrawal, 205 F.3d at 302 (sole shareholder is not a participant in an ERISA-qualified plan); Fugarino, 969 F.2d at 186 (sole proprietor is not a participant); Kwatcher v. Massachusetts Serv. Employees Pension Fund, 879 F.2d 957, 963 (CA1 1989) (sole shareholder is not a participant); Giardono v. Jones, 867 F.2d 409, 411-412 (CA7 1989) (sole proprietor is not a participant); Peckham v. Board of Trustees of Int'l Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades Union, 653 F.2d 424, 427-428 (CA10 1981) (sole proprietor is not a participant), with Vega v. National Life Ins. Servs., Inc., 188 F.3d 287, 294 (CA5 1999) (co-owner is a participant); In re Baker, 114 F.3d 636, 639 (CA7 1997) (majority shareholder is a participant); Madonia v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Virginia, 11 F.3d 444, 450 (CA4 1993) (sole shareholder is a participant). 2 The Courts of Appeals are also divided on whether working owners may qualify as "beneficiaries" of ERISA-sheltered employee benefit plans.  Compare 287 F.3d 521, 525 (CA6 2002) (case below) (sole shareholder is not a beneficiary of an ERISA-qualified plan); Agrawal, 205 F.3d at 302 (sole shareholder is not a beneficiary), with Gilbert v. Alta Health & Life Ins. Co., 276 F.3d 1292, 1302 (CA11 2001) (sole shareholder is a beneficiary); Wolk v. UNUM Life Ins. of Am., 186 F.3d 352, 356 (CA3 1999) (partner is a beneficiary); Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Doe, 76 F.3d 206, 208 (CA8 1996) (controlling shareholder is a beneficiary); Robinson v. Linomaz, 58 F.3d 365, 370 (CA8 1995) (co-owners are beneficiaries); Peterson v. American Life & Health Ins. Co., 48 F.3d 404, 409 (CA9 1995) (partner is a beneficiary).  The United States, as amicus curiae, urges that treating working owners as "beneficiaries" of an ERISA-qualified plan is not an acceptable solution.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9 (The beneficiary approach "has no logical stopping point, because it would allow a plan to cover anyone it chooses, including independent contractors excluded by [Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden,503 U.S. 318, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344 (1992)]" and "fails to resolve participation questions for pension plans which, unlike welfare plans, tie coverage directly to service as an employee."); id., at 24-25.  This issue is not presented here, and we do not resolve it.

    II 

A 

 ERISA's definitions of "employee," and, in turn, "participant," are uninformative.  See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden,503 U.S. 318, 323, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344 (1992) ("ERISA's nominal definition of 'employee' as 'any individual employed by an employer' is completely circular and explains nothing." (citation omitted)).  We therefore look to other provisions of the Act for instruction.  See ibid. ERISA's text contains multiple indications that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants.  Because these indications combine to provide "specific guidance," ibid., there is no cause in this case to resort to common law. 3Cf. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden,503 U.S. 318, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344 (1992), and Clackamas Gastroenterology Assocs., P.C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, 155 L. Ed. 2d 615, 123 S. Ct. 1673 (2003) (finding textual clues absent, Court looked to common law for guidance).

Congress enacted ERISA against a backdrop of IRC provisions that permitted corporate shareholders, partners, and sole proprietors to participate in tax-qualified pension plans.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-20.  Working shareholders have been eligible to participate in such plans since 1942.  See Revenue Act of 1942, ch. 619, § 165(a)(4), 56 Stat. 862 (a pension plan shall be tax exempt if, inter alia, "the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, persons whose principal duties consist in supervising the work of other employees, or highly compensated  employees").  Two decades later, still prior to ERISA's adoption, Congress permitted partners and sole proprietors to establish tax-favored pension plans, commonly known as "H. R. 10" or "Keogh" plans.  Self-Employed Individuals Tax Retirement Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 809; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19.  Thus, by 1962, working owners of all kinds could contribute to tax-qualified retirement plans. 

 ERISA's enactment in 1974 did not change that situation. 4 A particular employee benefit plan may be covered by one title of ERISA, but not by another.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n 9. Rather, Congress' objective was to harmonize ERISA with longstanding tax provisions.  Title I of ERISA and related IRC provisions expressly contemplate the participation of working owners in covered benefit plans.  Id., at 14-16.  Most notably, several Title I provisions partially exempt  certain plans in which working owners likely participate from otherwise mandatory ERISA provisions.  Exemptions of this order would be unnecessary if working owners could not qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans in the first place. 

To illustrate, Title I frees the following plans from the Act's fiduciary responsibility requirements: "(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees; or "(2) any agreement described in section 736 of [the IRC], which provides payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest." 29 U.S.C. § 1101(a) [29 USCS § 1101(a)]. 

The IRC defines the term "highly compensated employee" to include "any employee who . . . was a 5-percent owner at any time during the year or the preceding year." 26 U.S.C. § 414(q)(1)(A)  [26 USCS § 414(q)(1)(A)].  A "5-percent owner," the IRC further specifies, is "any person who owns . . . more than 5 percent of the outstanding stock of the corporation or stock possessing more than 5 percent of the total combined voting power of all stock of the corporation" if the employer is a corporation, or "any person who owns more than 5 percent of the capital or profits interest in the employer" if the employer is not a corporation.  § 416(i)(1)(B)(i).  Under these definitions, some working owners would fit the description "highly compensated employees." Similarly, agreements that make payments to retired partners, or to deceased partners' successors in interest, surely involve plans in which working partners participate. 

 Title I also contains more limited exemptions from ERISA's fiduciary responsibility requirements.  These exemptions, too, cover plans that ordinarily include working owners as participants.  To illustrate, assets of an employee benefit plan typically must be held in trust.  See 29 U.S.C. § 1103(a) [29 USCS § 1103(a)].  That requirement, however, does not apply, inter alia, "to a plan . . . some or all of the participants of which are employees described in section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC]." 29 U.S.C. § 1103(b)(3)(A) [29 USCS § 1103(b)(3)(A)].  IRC § 401(c)(1)(A) defines an "employee" to include "a self-employed individual"; and IRC §§ 401(c)(1)(B) and (2)(A)(i), in turn, define "a self-employed individual" to cover an individual with "earned income" from "a trade or business in which personal services of the taxpayer are a material income-producing factor." This definition no doubt encompasses working sole proprietors and partners. 26 U.S.C. §§ 1402(a) and (c) [26 USCS §§ 1402(a) and (c)]. 

Title I also contains exemptions from ERISA's prohibited transaction provisions.  Like the fiduciary responsibility exemptions, these exemptions indicate that working owners may participate in ERISA-qualified plans.  For example, although Title I generally bars transactions between a plan and a party in interest, 29 USC § 1106 [29 USCS § 1106], the Act permits, among other exceptions, loans to plan participants if certain  conditions are satisfied, § 1108(b)(1).  One condition is that loans must not be "made available to highly compensated employees . . . in an amount  greater than the amount made available to other employees." § 1108(b)(1)(B).  As just observed, see supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 54-55, some working owners, including shareholder-employees, qualify as "highly compensated employees."  Title I goes on to exclude "owner-employees," as defined in the IRC, from the participant loan exemption. § 1108(d)(1)).  Under the IRC's definition, owner-employees include partners "who ow[n] more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in [a] partnership" and sole proprietors, but not shareholder-employees.  26 U.S.C. § 401(c)(3) [26 USCS § 401(c)(3)].  In sum, Title I's provisions involving loans to plan participants, by explicit inclusion or exclusion, assume that working owners--shareholder-employees, partners, and sole proprietors--may participate in ERISA-qualified benefit plans. 

Provisions of Title IV of ERISA are corroborative.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17, and n 8.  Title IV does not apply to plans "established and maintained exclusively for substantial owners," 29 U.S.C. § 1321(b)(9) [29 USCS § 1321(b)(9)]  (emphasis added), a category that includes sole proprietors and shareholders and partners with a ten percent or greater ownership interest, § 1322(b)(5)(A)).  But Title IV does cover plans in which substantial owners participate along with other employees.  See§ 1322(b)(5)(B).  In addition, Title IV does not cover plans established by "professional service employers" with 25 or fewer active participants.  § 1321(b)(13).  Yates's medical practice was set up as a professional service employer.  See § 1321(c)(2)(A) (a "professional service employer" is "any proprietorship, partnership, corporation . . . owned or controlled by professional individuals . . . the principal business of which is the performance of professional services").  But significantly larger plans--plans covering more than 25 employees--established  by a professional service employer would presumably qualify for protection. 

Particularly instructive, Title IV and the IRC, as amended by Title II, clarify a key point missed by several lower courts:  Under ERISA, a working owner may have dual status, i.e., he can be an employee entitled to participate in a plan and, at the same time, the employer (or owner or member of the employer) who established the plan.  Both Title IV and the IRC describe the "employer" of a sole proprietor or partner. See 29 U.S.C. § 1301(b)(1) [29 USCS § 1301(b)(1)] ("An individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business is treated as his own employer, and a partnership is treated as the employer of each partner who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) of [the IRC]."); 26 U.S.C. § 401(c)(4) [26 USCS § 401(c)(4)] ("An individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business shall be treated as his own employer.  A partnership shall be treated as the employer of each partner who is an employee within the meaning of [§ 401(c)(1)].").  These descriptions expressly anticipate that a working owner can wear two hats, as an employer and employee.  Cf. Clackamas Gastroenterology Assocs., P. C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, ___, 155 L. Ed. 2d 615, 123 S. Ct. 1673 (2003) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) ("Clackamas readily acknowledges  that the physician-shareholders are 'employees' for ERISA purposes."). 

 In sum, because the statute's text is adequately informative, we need not look outside ERISA itself to conclude with security that Congress intended working owners to qualify as plan participants. 5 We do not suggest that each provision described supra, at ____13-15, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 54-56, in isolation, would compel the Court's reading.  But cf. post, at 25-26, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 62-63 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  In combination, however, the provisions supply "specific guidance" adequate to obviate any need to expound on common law. See Darden, 503 U.S., at 323, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344.

Congress' aim is advanced by our reading of the text.  The working employer's opportunity personally to participate  and gain ERISA coverage serves as an incentive to the creation of plans that will benefit employer and nonowner employees alike.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-22.  Treating working owners as participants not only furthers ERISA's purpose to promote and facilitate employee benefit plans.  Recognizing the working owner as an ERISA-sheltered plan participant also avoids the anomaly that the same plan will be controlled by discrete regimes:  federal-law governance for the nonowner employees; state-law governance for the working owner.  See, e.g., Agrawal, 205 F.3d at 302 (because sole shareholder does not rank as a plan participant under ERISA, his state-law claims against insurer are not preempted).  ERISA's goal, this Court has emphasized, is "uniform national treatment of pension benefits." Patterson v. Shumate,504 U.S. 753, 765, 119 L. Ed. 2d 519, 112 S. Ct. 2242 (1992).  Excepting working owners from the federal Act's coverage would generate administrative difficulties and is hardly consistent with a national uniformity goal.  Cf. Madonia, 11 F.3d at 450 ("Disallowing shareholders . . . from being plan 'participants' would result in disparate treatment of corporate employees' claims, thereby frustrating the statutory purpose of ensuring similar treatment for all claims relating to employee benefit plans."). 

 We note finally that a 1999 Department of Labor advisory opinion accords with our comprehension of Title I's definition and coverage provisions.  Pension and Welfare Benefits Admin., U. S. Dept. of Labor, Advisory Opinion 99-04A, 26 BNA Pension and Benefits Rptr. 559 (hereinafter Advisory Opinion 99-04A).  Confirming that working owners may qualify as participants in ERISA-protected plans, the Department's opinion concludes: "In our view, the statutory provisions of ERISA, taken as a whole, reveal a clear Congressional design to include 'working owners' within the definition of 'participant' for purposes of Title I of ERISA.  Congress could not have intended that a pension plan operated so as to  satisfy the complex tax qualification rules applicable to benefits provided to 'owner-employees' under the provisions of Title II of ERISA, and with respect to which an employer faithfully makes the premium payments required to protect the benefits payable under the plan to such individuals under Title IV of ERISA, would somehow transgress against the limitations of the definitions contained in Title I of ERISA.  Such a result would cause an intolerable conflict between the separate titles of ERISA, leading to the sort  of 'absurd results' that the Supreme Court warned against in Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Darden,503 U.S. 318, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344 (1992)." Id., at 560-561 (footnote omitted).

This agency view on the qualification of a self-employed individual for plan participation reflects a "body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance." Skidmore v. Swift & Co.,323 U.S. 134, 140, 89 L. Ed. 124, 65 S. Ct. 161 (1944). 

B 

 The Sixth Circuit's leading decision in point--its 1992 determination in Fugarino--relied, in large part, on an incorrect reading of a Department of Labor regulation, 29 CFR § 2510.3-3.  The Fugarino court read the Department's regulation to rule out classification of a working owner as an employee of the business he owns.  Entitled "Employee benefit plan," the regulation complements § 3(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1002(3) [29 USCS § 1002(3)], which defines "employee benefit plan," see supra, at 7, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 50-51; the regulation provides, in relevant part: "(b) Plans without employees.  For purposes of title I of the Act and this chapter, the term 'employee benefit plan' shall not include any plan, fund or program, other than an apprenticeship or other training program, under which no employees are participants covered under the plan, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.  For example, a so-called 'Keogh' or 'H. R. 10' plan under  which only partners or only a sole proprietor are participants covered under the plan will not be covered under title I.  However, a Keogh plan under which one or more common law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals, are participants covered under the plan, will be covered under title I.  . . . "(c) Employees.  For purposes of this section: "(1) An individual and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to a trade or business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is wholly owned by the individual or by the individual and his or her spouse, and "(2) A partner in a partnership and his or her spouse shall not be deemed to be employees with respect to the partnership." 29 CFR § 2510.3-3 (2003) (emphasis added and deleted).

In common with other Courts of Appeals that have held working owners do not qualify as participants in ERISA-governed employee benefit plans, the Sixth Circuit apparently understood the regulation to provide a generally applicable definition of the term "employee," controlling for all Title I purposes. Fugarino, 969 F.2d at 185-186 ("As a result of [the] regulatio[n], a plan whose sole beneficiaries are the company's owners cannot qualify as a plan under ERISA.  Further, an employer cannot ordinarily be an employee or participant under ERISA." (citation omitted)).  See also Kwatcher, 879 F.2d at 961 ("By its terms, the regulation unambiguously debars a sole shareholder . . . from 'employee' status, notwithstanding that he may work for the corporation he owns, shoulder to shoulder with eligible (non-owner)  employees."); Giardono, 867 F.2d at 412 ("[This] regulatio[n]exclude[s] from the definition of an employee any individual who wholly owns a trade or business, whether incorporated or unincorporated."). 

Almost eight years after its decision in Fugarino, in Agrawal, the Sixth Circuit implied that it may have misread the regulation: "Th[e] limiting definition of employee [in § 2510.3-3(c)] addresses the threshold issue of whether an ERISA plan exists.  It is not consistent with the purpose of ERISA to apply this limiting definition of employee to the statutory definitions of participant and beneficiary." 205 F.3d at 303.  The Circuit, however, did not overrule its earlier interpretation.  See 287 F.3d at 525 (case below) ("[T]he three judge panel before which this appeal is currently pending has no authority to overrule Fugarino."); Agrawal, 205 F.3d at 302 ("the decision in the present case is preordained by the Fugarino holding"). 

The Department of Labor's 1999 advisory opinion, see supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 57-58, interprets the "Employee benefit plan" regulation as follows: "In its regulation at 29 C. F. R. 2510.3-3, the Department clarified that the term 'employee benefit plan' as defined in section 3(3) of Title  I does not include a plan the only participants of which are '[a]n individual and his or her spouse . . . with respect to a trade of business, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is wholly owned by the individual or by the individual and his or her spouse' or '[a] partner in a partnership and his or her spouse.' The regulation further specifies, however, that a plan that covers as participants 'one or more common law employees, in addition to the self-employed individuals' will be included in the definition of 'employee benefit plan' under section 3(3) .  The conclusion of this opinion, that such 'self-employed individuals' are themselves 'participants' in the covered plan, is fully consistent with that regulation." Advisory Opinion 99-04A, at 561, n 7 (emphasis added).

This agency view, overlooked by the Sixth Circuit, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26, merits the Judiciary's  respectful consideration.  Cf. Clackamas Gastroenterology Assocs., P. C., 538 U.S. 440, ___, 155 L. Ed. 2d 615, 123 S. Ct. 167 (EEOC guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 are persuasive). 

 The Department's regulation itself reveals the definitional prescription's limited scope.  The prescription describes "employees" only "[f]or purposes of this section," see supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 58 (emphasis deleted), i.e., the section defining "employee benefit plans." Accordingly, the regulation addresses only what plans qualify as "employee benefit plans" under Title I of ERISA.  Plans that cover only sole owners or partners and their spouses, the regulation instructs, fall outside Title I's domain. 6 Courts agree that if a benefit plan covers only working owners, it is not covered by Title I.  See, e.g., Slamen v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 166 F.3d 1102, 1105 (CA11 1999) (sole shareholder is not a participant where disability plan covered only him); In re Watson, 161 F.3d 593, 597 (CA9 1998) (sole shareholder is not a participant where retirement plan covered only him); SEC v. Johnston, 143 F.3d 260, 262-263 (CA6 1998) (owner is not a participant where pension plan covered only owner and "perhaps" his wife); Schwartz v. Gordon, 761 F.2d 864, 867 (CA2 1985) (self-employed individual is not a participant where he is the only contributor to a Keogh plan).  Such a plan, however, could qualify for favorable tax treatment.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18, n 9. Plans covering  working owners and their nonowner employees, on the other hand, fall entirely within ERISA's compass. 7Section 2510.3-3's preamble supports this interpretation.  The preamble states, in relevant part: "According to the comments [concerning proposed § 2510.3-3], a definition of 'employee' excluding self-employed individuals might raise problems under section 404(a)(1) with respect to disbursements to self-employed individuals from 'Keogh' or 'H. R. 10' plans covering both self-employed individuals and 'common law' employees.  Therefore, the definition of 'employee' formerly appearing in proposed § 2510.3-6 has been inserted into § 2510.3-3 and restricted in scope to that section." 40 Fed. Reg. 34528 (1975) (emphasis added). See Vega, 188 F.3d at 294 ("We . . . interpret the regulatio[n] to define employee only for purposes of determining the existence of an ERISA plan."); Madonia, 11 F.3d at 449- 450 ("[T]he regulation does not govern the issue of whether someone is a 'participant' in an ERISA plan, once the existence of that plan has been established.  This makes perfect sense: once a plan has been established, it would be anomalous to have those persons benefitting from it governed by two disparate sets of legal obligations."). 

 Also in common with other Courts of Appeals that have denied participant status to working owners, the Sixth Circuit's leading decision mistakenly relied, in addition, on ERISA's "anti-inurement" provision, 29 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1) [29 USCS § 1103(c)(1)], which prohibits plan assets from inuring to the benefit of employers.  See Fugarino, 969 F.2d at 186 ("A fundamental requirement of ERISA is that 'the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer . . .'"); Kwatcher, 879 F.2d at 960 ("Once a person has been found to fit within the 'employer' integument, [§ 1103(c)(1)] prohibits payments to him from a qualified plan."); Giardono, 867 F.2d at 411 ("It is a fundamental requirement of ERISA that '. . . the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer . . . .'"). 

 Correctly read, however, the anti-inurement provision does not preclude Title I coverage of working owners as plan participants.  It states that, with enumerated exceptions, "the assets of a plan shall never inure to the benefit of any employer and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan." 29 U.S.C. § 1103(c)(1) [29 USCS § 1103(c)(1)].  The provision demands only that plan assets be held for supplying benefits to plan participants.  Like the Department of Labor regulation, see supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 58, the anti-inurement provision does not address the discrete question whether working owners, along with nonowner employees, may be participants in ERISA-sheltered plans.  As the Fifth Circuit observed in Vega:"Th[e] [anti-inurement] provision refers to the congressional determination that funds contributed by the employer (and, obviously, by the [nonowner] employees . . .) must never revert to the employer; it does not relate to plan benefits  being paid with funds or assets of the plan to cover a legitimate pension or health benefit claim by an employee who happens to be a stockholder or even the sole shareholder of a corporation." 188 F.3d at 293, n. 5.

 ERISA's anti-inurement provision is based on the analogous exclusive benefit provision in the IRC, 26 U.S.C. § 401(a)(2) [26 USCS § 401(a)(2)], which has never been understood to bar tax-qualified plan participation by working owners.  See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, pp 302-303 (1974); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29.  The purpose of the anti-inurement provision, in common with ERISA's other fiduciary responsibility provisions, is to apply the law of trusts to discourage abuses such as self-dealing, imprudent investment, and misappropriation of plan assets, by employers and others.  See, e.g., Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. Doe, 76 F.3d 206, 209 (CA8 1996).Those concerns are not implicated by paying benefits to working owners who participate on an equal basis with nonowner employees in ERISA-protected plans. 

 In sum, the anti-inurement provision, like the Department of Labor regulation, establishes no categorical barrier to working owner participation in ERISA plans.  Whether Yates himself, in his handling of loan repayments, see supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 52, engaged in conduct inconsistent with the anti-inurement provision is an issue not yet reached by the courts below, one on which we express no opinion. * * * 

 For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,  including consideration of questions earlier raised but not resolved.  Specifically, given the undisputed facts concerning Yates's handling of the loan, i.e., his failure to honor the periodic repayment requirements: (1) Did the November 1996 close-to-bankruptcy repayments, despite the prior defaults, become "a portion of [Yates's] interest in a qualified retirement plan . . . excluded from his bankruptcy estate," App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a; and (2) if so, were the repayments "beyond the reach of [the Bankruptcy] [T]rustee's power to avoid and recover preferential transfers," id., at 47a? 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 The Sixth Amendment safeguards to an accused who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all critical stages of the criminal process. Maine v. Moulton,474 U.S. 159, 170, 88 L. Ed. 2d 481, 106 S. Ct. 477 (1985); United States v. Wade,388 U.S. 218, 224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, 87 S. Ct. 1926 (1967).The entry of a guilty plea, whether to a misdemeanor or a felony charge, ranks as a "critical stage" at which the right to counsel adheres. Argersinger v. Hamlin,407 U.S. 25, 34, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 92 S. Ct. 2006 (1972); White v. Maryland,373 U.S. 59, 60, 10 L. Ed. 2d 193, 83 S. Ct. 1050 (1963)(per curiam).Waiver of the right to counsel, as of constitutional rights in the criminal process generally, must be a "knowing, intelligent ac[t] done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances." Brady v. United States,397 U.S. 742, 748, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747, 90 S. Ct. 1463 (1970).  This case concerns the extent to which a trial judge, before accepting a guilty plea from an uncounseled defendant, must  elaborate on the right to representation. 

 Beyond affording the defendant the opportunity to consult with counsel prior to entry of a plea and to be assisted by counsel at the plea hearing, must the court, specifically: (1) advise the defendant that "waiving the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty [entails] the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked"; and (2) "admonis[h]" the defendant "that by waiving his right to an attorney he will lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty"?  656 N.W.2d 112, 121 (Iowa 2003).  The Iowa Supreme Court held both warnings essential to the "knowing and intelligent" waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel. Ibid.

We hold that neither warning is mandated by the Sixth Amendment.  The constitutional requirement is satisfied when the trial court informs the accused of the nature of the charges against him, of his right to be counseled regarding his plea, and of the range of allowable punishments attendant upon the entry of a guilty plea. 

I 

On November 2, 1996, respondent Felipe Edgardo Tovar, then a 21-year-old college student, was arrested in Ames, Iowa, for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OWI).  See Iowa Code § 321J.2 (1995). 1"A person commits the offense of operating while intoxicated if the person operates a motor vehicle in this state in either of the following conditions: a. While under the influence of an alcoholic beverage . . . .  b. While having an alcohol concentration . . . of .10 or more." Iowa Code § 321J.2(1) (1995). An intoxilyzer test administered the night of Tovar's arrest showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.194.  App. 24.  The arresting officer informed Tovar of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966).  Tovar signed a form stating that he waived those rights and agreed to answer questions.  Iowa State Univ. Dept. of Public Safety, OWI Supplemental Report 3 (Nov. 2, 1996), Lodging of Petitioner; Iowa State Univ. Dept. of Public Safety, Rights Warnings (Nov. 2, 1996), Lodging of Petitioner. 

Some hours after his arrest, Tovar appeared before a judge in the Iowa District Court for Story County.  The judge indicated on the Initial Appearance form that Tovar appeared without counsel and waived application for court-appointed counsel.  Initial Appearance in No. OWCR 23989 (Nov. 2, 1996), Lodging of Petitioner.  The judge also marked on the form's checklist that Tovar was "informed of the charge and his . . . rights and receive[d] a copy of the Complaint." Ibid. Arraignment was set for November 18, 1996.  In the interim,  Tovar was released from jail. 

At the November 18 arraignment, 2Tovar appeared in court along with four other individuals charged with misdemeanor offenses.  App. 6-10.  The presiding judge proposed to conduct the plea proceeding for the five cases jointly, and each of the individuals indicated he did not object to that course of action.  Id., at 11. the court's inquiries of Tovar began: "Mr. Tovar appears without counsel and I see, Mr. Tovar, that you waived application for a court appointed attorney.  Did you want to represent  yourself at today's hearing?" App. 8-9.  Tovar replied: "Yes, sir." Id., at 9.  The court soon after asked: "[H]ow did you wish to plead?" Tovar answered: "Guilty." Ibid. Tovar affirmed that he  had not been promised anything or threatened in any way to induce him to plead guilty. Id., at 13-14. 

Conducting the guilty plea colloquy required by the Iowa Rules of Criminal Procedure, see Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8 (1992), 3The Rule has since been renumbered 2.8. the court explained that, if Tovar pleaded not guilty,  he would be entitled to a speedy and public trial by jury, App. 15, and would have the right to be represented at that trial by an attorney, who "could help [Tovar] select a jury, question and cross-examine the State's witnesses, present evidence, if any, in [his] behalf, and make arguments to the judge and jury on [his] behalf," id., at 16.  By pleading guilty, the court cautioned, "not only [would Tovar] give up [his] right to a trial [of any kind on the charge against him], [he would] give up [his] right to be represented by an attorney at that trial." Ibid. The court further advised Tovar that, if he entered a guilty plea, he would relinquish the right to remain silent at trial, the right to the presumption of innocence, and the right to subpoena witnesses and compel their testimony.  Id., at 16-19. 

Turning to the particular offense with which Tovar had been charged, the court informed him that an OWI conviction carried a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine, and a minimum penalty of two days in jail and a $500 fine. Id., at 20.  Tovar affirmed that he understood his exposure to those penalties.  Ibid. The court next explained that, before accepting a guilty plea, the court had to assure itself that Tovar was in fact guilty of the charged offense.  Id., at 21-22.  To that end, the court informed Tovar that the OWI charge had only two elements: first, on the date in question, Tovar was operating a motor vehicle in the State of Iowa; second, when he did so, he was intoxicated.  Id., at 23.  Tovar confirmed that he had been driving in Ames, Iowa, on the night he was apprehended and that he did not dispute the results of the intoxilyzer test administered by  the police that night, which showed that his blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit nearly twice over.  Id., at 23-24. 

After the plea colloquy, the court asked Tovar if he still wished to plead guilty, and Tovar affirmed that he did.  Id., at 27-28.  The court then accepted Tovar's plea, observing that there was "a factual basis" for it, and that Tovar had made the plea "voluntarily, with a full understanding of [his] rights,  [and] . . . of the consequences of [pleading guilty]." Id., at 28. 

On December 30, 1996, Tovar appeared for sentencing on the OWI charge 4At that stage, it was still open to Tovar to request withdrawal of his guilty plea on the OWI charge and to substitute a plea of not guilty.  See Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992). and, simultaneously, for arraignment on a subsequent charge of driving with a suspended license.  Id., at 45-46; see Iowa Code § 321J.21 (1995). 5In order to appear at the OWI arraignment, Tovar drove to the courthouse despite the suspension of his license; he was apprehended en route home.  App. 50, 53. Noting that Tovar was again in attendance without counsel, the  court inquired: "Mr. Tovar, did you want to represent yourself at today's hearing or did you want to take some time to hire an attorney to represent you?" App. 46. 6Prior to asking Tovar whether he wished to hire counsel, the court noted that Tovar had applied for a court-appointed attorney but that his application had been denied because he was financially dependent upon his parents.  Id., at 46.  Tovar does not here challenge the absence of counsel at sentencing. Tovar replied that he would represent himself.  Ibid. The court then engaged in essentially the same plea colloquy on the suspension charge as it had on the OWI charge the previous month.  Id., at 48-51.  After accepting Tovar's guilty plea on the suspension charge, the court sentenced him on both counts: For the OWI conviction, the court imposed the minimum sentence of two days in jail and a $500 fine, plus a surcharge and costs; for the suspension conviction, the court imposed a $250 fine, plus a surcharge and costs.  Id., at 55. 

On March 16, 1998, Tovar was convicted of OWI for a second time.  He was represented by counsel in that proceeding, in which he pleaded guilty.  Record 60; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 24, n 1. 

On December 14, 2000, Tovar was again charged with OWI, this time as a third offense, see Iowa Code § 321J.2 (1999), and additionally with driving while license barred, see § 321.561.  Iowa law classifies first-offense OWI as a serious misdemeanor and second-offense OWI as an aggravated misdemeanor. §§ 321J.2(2)(a)-(b).  Third-offense OWI, and any OWI offenses thereafter, rank as class "D" felonies.  § 321J.2(2)(c). Represented by an attorney, Tovar pleaded not guilty to both December 2000 charges.  Record 55. 

In March 2001, through counsel, Tovar filed a Motion for Adjudication of Law Points;  7See Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 10(2) (1992) ("Any defense, objection, or request which is capable of determination without the trial of the general issue may be raised before trial by motion."); State v. Wilt, 333 N.W.2d 457, 460 (Iowa 1983) (approving use of motions for adjudication of law points under Iowa Rule of Criminal Procedure 10(2) where material facts are undisputed). the motion urged that Tovar's first OWI conviction, in 1996, could not be used to enhance the December 2000 OWI charge from a second-offense aggravated misdemeanor to a third-offense felony.  App. 3-5. 8Tovar conceded that the 1998 OWI conviction could be used for enhancement purposes.  Record 60. Significantly, Tovar did not allege that he was unaware at the November 1996 arraignment of his right to counsel prior to pleading guilty and at the plea hearing. Instead, he maintained that his 1996 waiver of counsel was invalid--not "full knowing, intelligent, and voluntary"--because he "was never made aware by the court . . . of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation." Id., at 3-4. 

 The court denied Tovar's motion in May 2001, explaining: "Where the offense is readily understood by laypersons and the penalty is not unduly severe, the duty of inquiry which is imposed upon the court is only that which is required to assure an awareness of [the] right to counsel and a willingness to proceed without counsel in the face of such awareness." App. to Pet. for Cert. 36-37 (brackets in original).  Tovar then waived his right to a jury trial and was found guilty by the court of both  the OWI third-offense charge and driving while license barred.  Id., at 33.  Four months after that adjudication, Tovar was sentenced.  On the OWI third-offense charge, he received a 180-day jail term, with all but 30 days suspended, three years of probation, and a $2,500 fine plus surcharges and costs.  App. 70-71.  For driving while license barred, Tovar received a 30-day jail term, to run concurrently with the OWI sentence, and a suspended $500 fine. Id., at 71. 

The Iowa Court of Appeals affirmed,  App. to Pet. for Cert. 23-30, but the Supreme Court of Iowa, by a 4 to 3 vote, reversed and remanded for entry of judgment without consideration of Tovar's first OWI conviction, 656 N.W.2d 112 (2003).  Iowa's highest court acknowledged that "the dangers of proceeding pro se at a guilty plea proceeding will be different than the dangers of proceeding pro se at a jury trial, [therefore] the inquiries made at these proceedings will also be different." Id., at 119.  The court nonetheless held that the colloquy preceding acceptance of Tovar's 1996 guilty plea had been constitutionally inadequate, and instructed dispositively: "[A] defendant such as Tovar who chooses to plead guilty without the assistance of an attorney must be advised of the usefulness of an attorney and the dangers of self-representation in order to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. . . . [T]he trial judge [must] advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by  laypersons and that the danger in waiving the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked.  The defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney he will lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty. In addition, the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the range of allowable punishments." Id., at 121. 9The dissenting justices criticized the majority's approach as "rigid" and out of line with the pragmatic approach this Court described in Patterson v. Illinois,487 U.S. 285, 298, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389 (1988).   656 N. W. 2d, at 122.  They noted that, in addition to advice concerning the constitutional rights a guilty plea relinquishes, Tovar was "made fully aware of the penal consequences that might befall him if he went forward without counsel and pleaded guilty." Ibid.

We granted certiorari, 539 U.S.     , 539 U.S. 987, 156 L. Ed. 2d 703, 124 S. Ct. 44(2003), in view of the division of opinion on the requirements the Sixth Amendment imposes for waiver of counsel at a plea hearing, compare, e.g., United States v. Akins, 276 F.3d 1141, 1146-1147 (CA9 2002), with State v. Cashman, 491 N.W.2d 462, 465-466 (S. D. 1992), and we now reverse the judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court. 

II 

 The Sixth Amendment secures to a defendant who faces incarceration the right to counsel at all "critical stages" of the criminal process. See, e.g., Maine v. Moulton,474 U.S., at 170, 88 L. Ed. 2d 481, 106 S. Ct. 477; United States v. Wade,388 U.S., at 224, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1149, 87 S. Ct. 1926.  A plea hearing qualifies as  a "critical stage." White v. Maryland,373 U.S., at 60, 10 L. Ed. 2d 193, 83 S. Ct. 1050.  Because Tovar received a two-day prison term for his 1996 OWI conviction, he had a right to counsel both at the plea stage and at trial had he elected to contest the charge.  Argersinger v. Hamlin,407 U.S., at 34, 37, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530, 92 S. Ct. 2006. 

 A person accused of crime, however, may choose to forgo representation.  While the Constitution "does not force a lawyer upon a defendant," Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann,317 U.S. 269, 279, 87 L. Ed. 268, 63 S. Ct. 236 (1942), it does require that any waiver of the right to counsel be knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, see Johnson v. Zerbst,304 U.S. 458, 464, 82 L. Ed. 1461, 58 S. Ct. 1019 (1938).  Tovar contends that his waiver of counsel in November 1996, at his first OWI plea hearing, was insufficiently informed, and therefore constitutionally invalid.  In particular, he asserts that the trial judge did not elaborate on the value, at that stage of the case, of an attorney's advice and the dangers of self-representation in entering a plea.  Brief for Respondent 15. 10The United States as amicus curiae reads our decision in Scott v. Illinois,440 U.S. 367, 59 L. Ed. 2d 383, 99 S. Ct. 1158 (1979), to hold that a constitutionally defective waiver of counsel in a misdemeanor prosecution, although warranting vacation of any term of imprisonment, affords no ground for disturbing the underlying conviction.  Amicus accordingly contends that the Constitution should not preclude use of an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction to enhance the penalty for a subsequent offense, regardless of the validity of the prior waiver.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11, n 3.  The State, however, does not contest the Iowa Supreme Court's determination that a conviction obtained without an effective waiver of counsel cannot be used to enhance a subsequent charge.  See ibid. We therefore do not address arguments amicus advances questioning that premise.  See also id., at 29, n 12.

We have described a waiver of counsel as intelligent when the defendant "knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open." Adams, 317 U.S., at 279, 87 L. Ed. 268, 63 S. Ct. 236.  We have not, however, prescribed any formula or script to be read to a defendant who states that he elects to proceed without counsel.  The information a defendant must possess in order to make an intelligent election, our decisions indicate, will depend on a range of case-specific factors, including the defendant's education or sophistication, the complex or easily grasped nature of the charge, and the stage of the proceeding.  See Johnson, 304 U.S., at 464, 82 L. Ed. 1461, 58 S. Ct. 1019. 

As to waiver of trial counsel, we have said that before a defendant may be allowed to proceed pro se, he must be warned specifically of the hazards ahead.  Faretta v. California,422 U.S. 806, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562, 95 S. Ct. 2525 (1975), is instructive.  The defendant in Faretta resisted counsel's aid, preferring to represent himself.  The Court held that he had a constitutional right to self-representation. In recognizing that right, however, we cautioned:  "Although a defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation, he should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing . . . ." Id., at 835, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562, 95 S. Ct. 2525 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

 Later, in Patterson v. Illinois,487 U.S. 285, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389 (1988), we elaborated on  "the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation" to which Faretta referred. "[A]t trial," we observed, "counsel is required to help even the most gifted layman adhere to the rules of procedure and evidence, comprehend the subtleties of voir dire, examine and cross-examine witnesses effectively . . ., object to improper prosecution questions, and much more." 487 U.S., at 299, n. 13, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389.  Warnings of the pitfalls of proceeding to trial without counsel, we therefore said, must be "rigorous[ly]" conveyed. Id., at 298, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389.  We clarified, however, that at earlier stages of the criminal process, a less searching or formal colloquy may suffice.  Id., at 299, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389. 

Patterson concerned postindictment questioning by police and prosecutor.  At that stage of the case, we held, the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona,384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), adequately informed the defendant not only of his Fifth Amendment rights, but of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel as well.  487 U.S., at 293, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389. Miranda warnings, we said, effectively convey to a defendant his right to have counsel present during questioning.  In addition, they inform him of the "ultimate adverse consequence" of making uncounseled admissions, i.e., his statements may be used against him in any ensuing criminal proceeding.  487 U.S.,  at 293, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389.  The Miranda warnings, we added, "also sufficed . . . to let [the defendant] know what a lawyer could 'do for him,'" namely, advise him to refrain from making statements that could prove damaging to his defense.  487 U.S., at 294, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389. 

Patterson describes a "pragmatic approach to the waiver question," one that asks "what purposes a lawyer can serve at the particular stage of the proceedings in question, and what assistance he could provide to an accused at that stage," in order "to determine the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the type of warnings and procedures that should be required before a waiver of that right will be recognized." Id., at 298, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389.  We require less rigorous warnings pretrial, Patterson explained, not because pretrial proceedings are "less important" than trial, but because, at that stage, "the full dangers and disadvantages of self-representation . . . are less substantial and more obvious to an accused than they are at trial." Id., at 299, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 

In Tovar's case, the State maintains that, like the Miranda warnings we found adequate in Patterson, Iowa's plea colloquy suffices both to advise a defendant of his right to counsel, and to assure that his guilty plea is informed and voluntary.  Brief for Petitioner 20; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3.  The plea colloquy, according to the State, "makes plain that an attorney's role would be to challenge the charge or sentence," and therefore adequately conveys to the defendant both the utility of counsel and the dangers of self-representation. Brief for Petitioner 25.  Tovar, on the other hand, defends the precise instructions required by the Iowa Supreme Court, see supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 219, as essential to a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent  plea stage waiver of counsel. Brief for Respondent 15. 

To resolve this case, we need not endorse the State's position that nothing more than the plea colloquy was needed to safeguard Tovar's right to counsel. Preliminarily, we note that there were some things more in this case.  Tovar first indicated that he waived counsel at his Initial Appearance, see supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 216, affirmed that he wanted to represent himself at the plea hearing, see supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 216, and declined the court's offer of "time to hire an attorney" at sentencing, when it was still open to him to request withdrawal of his plea, see supra, at ____ - ____, and n 4, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 217.  Further, the State does not contest that a defendant must be alerted to his right to the assistance of counsel in entering a plea.  See Brief for Petitioner 19 (acknowledging defendant's need to know "retained or appointed counsel can assist" at the plea stage by "work[ing] on the issues of guilt and sentencing").  Indeed, the Iowa Supreme Court appeared to assume that Tovar was informed of his entitlement to counsel's aid or, at least, to have pretermitted that issue.  See  656 N.W. 2d, at 117.  Accordingly, the State presents a narrower question: "Does the Sixth Amendment require a court to give a rigid and detailed admonishment to a pro se defendant pleading guilty of the usefulness of an attorney, that an attorney may provide an independent opinion whether it is wise to plead guilty and that without an attorney the defendant risks overlooking a defense?" Pet. for Cert. i. 

 Training on that question, we turn to, and reiterate, the particular language the Iowa Supreme Court employed in announcing the warnings it thought the Sixth Amendment required: "[T]he trial judge [must] advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by laypersons and that the danger in waiving the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked,"  656 N.W. 2d, at 121; in addition, "[t]he defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney he will lose the opportunity to obtain an independent opinion on whether, under the facts and applicable law, it is wise to plead guilty," ibid. Tovar did not receive such advice, and the sole question before us is whether the Sixth Amendment compels the two admonitions here in controversy. 11The Supreme Court of Iowa also held that "the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the range of allowable punishments."  656 N.W. 2d, at 121.  The parties do not dispute that Tovar was so informed. We hold it does not. 

 This Court recently explained, in reversing a lower court determination that a guilty plea was not voluntary:  "[T]he law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in general in the circumstances--even though the defendant may not know the specific detailed consequences of invoking it." United States v. Ruiz,536 U.S. 622, 629, 153 L. Ed. 2d 586, 122 S. Ct. 2450 (2002) (emphasis in original).  We similarly observed in Patterson: "If [the defendant] . . . lacked a full and complete  appreciation of all of the consequences flowing from his waiver, it does not defeat the State's showing that the information it provided to him satisfied the constitutional minimum." 487 U.S., at 294, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Iowa Supreme Court gave insufficient consideration to these guiding decisions.  In prescribing scripted admonitions and holding them necessary in every guilty plea instance, we further note, the Iowa high court overlooked our observations that the information a defendant must have to waive counsel intelligently will "depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case," Johnson, 304 U.S., at 464, 82 L. Ed. 1461, 58 S. Ct. 1019; supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 220. 

 Moreover, as Tovar acknowledges, in a collateral attack on an uncounseled conviction, it is the defendant's burden to prove that he did not competently and intelligently waive his right to the assistance of counsel. See Watts v. State, 257 N.W.2d 70, 71 (Iowa 1977); Brief for Respondent 5, 26-27.  In that light, we note that Tovar has never claimed that he did not fully understand the charge or the range of punishment for the crime prior to pleading guilty. Further, he has never "articulate[d] with precision" the additional information counsel could have provided, given the simplicity of the charge.  See Patterson, 487 U.S., at 294, 101 L. Ed. 2d 261, 108 S. Ct. 2389; supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 217.  Nor does he assert that he was unaware of his right to be counseled prior to and at his arraignment. Before this Court, he suggests only that he "may have been under the mistaken belief that he had a right to counsel at trial, but not if he was merely going to plead guilty." Brief for Respondent 16 (emphasis added). 12The trial court's comment that Tovar appeared without counsel at the arraignment and the court's inquiry whether Tovar wanted to represent himself at that hearing, see App. 8-9, hardly lend support to Tovar's suggestion of what he "may have" believed.  See also id., at 46 (court's inquiry at sentencing whether Tovar "want[ed] to take some time to hire an attorney"); Iowa Rule Crim. Proc. 8(2)(a) (1992) ("[a]t any time before judgment," defendant may request withdrawal of guilty plea and substitution of not guilty plea).

 Given "the particular facts and circumstances surrounding [this] case," see Johnson, 304 U.S., at 464, 82 L. Ed. 2d 1461, 58 S. Ct. 1019 it is far from clear that warnings of the kind required by the Iowa Supreme Court would have enlightened Tovar's decision whether to seek counsel or to represent himself.  In a case so straightforward, the United States as amicus curiae suggests, the admonitions at issue might confuse or mislead a defendant more than they would inform him: The warnings the Iowa Supreme Court declared mandatory might be misconstrued as a veiled suggestion that a meritorious defense exists or that the defendant could plead to a lesser charge, when neither prospect is a realistic one.  If a defendant delays his plea in the vain hope that counsel could uncover a tenable basis for contesting or reducing the criminal charge, the prompt disposition of the case will be impeded, and the resources of either the State (if the defendant is indigent) or the defendant himself (if he is financially ineligible for appointed counsel) will be wasted.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9, 28-29; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21. 

 We note, finally, that States are free to adopt by statute, rule, or decision any guides to the acceptance of an uncounseled plea they deem useful.  See, e.g.,Alaska Rule Crim. Proc. 39(a) (2003); Fla. Rule Crim. Proc. 3.111(d) (2003); Md. Ct. Rule 4-215 (2002); Minn. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.02 (2003); Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 121, comment (2003).  We hold only that the two admonitions the Iowa Supreme Court ordered are not required by the Federal Constitution. * * * 

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court. 

 Petitioner Michael Crawford stabbed a man who allegedly tried to rape his wife, Sylvia.  At his trial, the State played for the jury Sylvia's tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing, even though he had no opportunity for cross-examination. The Washington Supreme Court upheld petitioner's conviction after determining that Sylvia's statement was reliable. The question presented is whether this procedure complied with the Sixth Amendment's guarantee that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him." 

I 

On August 5, 1999, Kenneth Lee was stabbed at his apartment.  Police arrested petitioner later that night.  After giving petitioner and his wife Miranda warnings, detectives interrogated each of them twice.  Petitioner eventually confessed that he and Sylvia had gone in search of Lee  because he was upset over an earlier incident in which Lee had tried to rape her.  The two had found Lee at his apartment, and a fight ensued in which Lee was stabbed in the torso and petitioner's hand was cut. 

Petitioner gave the following account of the fight: "Q. Okay.  Did you ever see anything in [Lee's] hands? "A. I think so, but I'm not positive. "Q. Okay, when you think so, what do you mean by that? "A. I coulda swore I seen him goin' for somethin' before, right before everything happened.  He was like  reachin', fiddlin' around down here and stuff . . . and I just . . . I don't know, I think, this is just a possibility, but I think, I think that he pulled somethin' out and I grabbed for it and that's how I got cut . . . but I'm not positive.  I, I, my mind goes blank when things like this happen.  I mean, I just, I remember things wrong, I remember things that just doesn't, don't make sense to me later." App. 155 (punctuation added).

Sylvia generally corroborated petitioner's story about the events leading up to the fight, but her account of the fight itself was arguably different--particularly with respect to whether Lee had drawn a weapon before petitioner assaulted him: "Q. Did Kenny do anything to fight back from this assault? "A. (pausing) I know he reached into his pocket . . . or somethin' . . . I don't know what. "Q. After he was stabbed? "A. He saw Michael coming up.  He lifted his hand . . . his chest open, he might [have] went to go strike his hand out or something and then (inaudible). "Q. Okay, you, you gotta speak up. "A. Okay, he lifted his hand over his head maybe to strike Michael's hand down or something and then he put his hands in his . . . put his right hand in his right pocket . . . took a step back . . . Michael proceeded to stab him . . . then his hands were like . . . how do you explain this . . . open arms . . . with his hands open and he fell down . . . and we ran (describing subject holding hands open, palms toward assailant). "Q. Okay, when he's standing there with his open hands, you're talking about Kenny, correct? "A. Yeah, after, after the fact, yes. "Q. Did you see anything in his hands at that point?  "A. (pausing) um um (no)." Id., at 137 (punctuation added).

 The State charged petitioner with assault and attempted murder.  At trial, he claimed self-defense. Sylvia did not testify because of the state marital privilege, which generally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouse's consent.  See Wash. Rev. Code § 5.60.060(1) (1994). In Washington, this privilege does not extend to a spouse's out-of-court statements admissible under a hearsay exception, see State v. Burden, 120 Wn. 2d 371, 377, 841 P.2d 758, 761 (1992), so the State sought to introduce Sylvia's tape-recorded statements to the police as evidence that the stabbing was not in self-defense. Noting that Sylvia had admitted she led petitioner to Lee's apartment and thus had facilitated  the assault, the State invoked the hearsay exception for statements against penal interest, Wash. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3) (2003). 

Petitioner countered that, state law notwithstanding, admitting the evidence would violate his federal constitutional right to be "confronted with the witnesses against him." Amdt. 6.  According to our description of that right in Ohio v. Roberts,448 U.S. 56, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597, 100 S. Ct. 2531 (1980), it does not bar admission of an unavailable witness's statement against a criminal defendant if the statement bears "adequate 'indicia of reliability.'" Id., at 66, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597, 100 S. Ct. 2531.  To meet that test, evidence must either fall within a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bear "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Ibid. The trial court here admitted the statement on the latter ground, offering several reasons why it was trustworthy: Sylvia was not shifting blame but rather corroborating her husband's story that he acted in self-defense or "justified reprisal"; she had direct knowledge as an eyewitness; she was describing recent events; and she was being questioned by a "neutral" law enforcement officer.  App. 76-77.  The prosecution played the tape for the jury and relied on it in closing, arguing that it was "damning evidence" that "completely  refutes [petitioner's] claim of self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999).  The jury convicted petitioner of assault. 

The Washington Court of Appeals reversed.  It applied a nine-factor test to determine whether Sylvia's statement bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, and noted several reasons why it did not: The statement contradicted one she had previously given; it was made in response to specific questions;  and at one point she admitted she had shut her eyes during the stabbing.  The court considered and rejected the State's argument that Sylvia's statement was reliable because it coincided with petitioner's to such a degree that the two "interlocked." The court determined that, although the two statements agreed about the events leading up to the stabbing, they differed on the issue crucial to petitioner's self-defense claim: "[Petitioner's] version asserts that Lee may have had something in his hand when he stabbed him; but Sylvia's version has Lee grabbing for something only after he has been stabbed." App. 32. 

The Washington Supreme Court reinstated the conviction, unanimously concluding that, although Sylvia's statement did not fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, it bore guarantees of trustworthiness: "'[W]hen a codefendant's confession is virtually identical [to, i.e., interlocks with,] that of a defendant, it may be deemed reliable.'" 147 Wash. 2d 424, 437, 54 P. 3d 656, 663 (2002) (quoting State v. Rice, 120 Wn. 2d 549, 570, 844 P.2d 416, 427 (1993)).  The court explained: "Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the statements were contradictory, upon closer inspection they appear to overlap.  . . . "[B]oth of the Crawfords' statements indicate that Lee was possibly grabbing for a weapon, but they are equally unsure when this event may have taken place.  They are also equally unsure how Michael received the cut on his hand, leading the court to question when,  if ever, Lee possessed a weapon.  In this respect they overlap. "[N]either Michael nor Sylvia clearly stated that Lee had a weapon in hand from which Michael was simply defending himself.  And it is this omission by both that interlocks the statements and makes Sylvia's statement reliable." 147 Wash. 2d, at 438-439, 54 P. 3d, at 664 (internal quotation marks omitted). 1The court rejected the State's argument that guarantees of trustworthiness were unnecessary since petitioner waived his confrontation rights by invoking the marital privilege.  It reasoned that "forcing the defendant to choose between the marital privilege and confronting his spouse presents an untenable Hobson's choice." 147 Wash. 2d, at 432, 54 P. 3d, at 660.  The State has not challenged this holding here.  The State also has not challenged the Court of Appeals' conclusion (not reached by the State Supreme Court) that the confrontation violation, if it occurred, was not harmless.  We express no opinion on these matters.

 We granted certiorari to determine whether the State's use of Sylvia's statement violated the Confrontation Clause.  540 U.S. 964, 157 L. Ed. 2d 309, 124 S. Ct. 460 (2003). 

II 

The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause provides that, "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him." We have held that this bedrock procedural guarantee applies to both federal and state prosecutions.  Pointer v. Texas,380 U.S. 400, 406, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923, 85 S. Ct. 1065 (1965).  As noted above, Roberts says that an unavailable witness's out-of-court statement may be admitted so long as it has adequate indicia of reliability--i.e., falls within a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448 U.S., at 66, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923, 85 S. Ct. 1065.  Petitioner argues that this test strays from the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause and urges us to reconsider it. 

A 

The Constitution's text does not alone resolve this case.  One could plausibly read "witnesses against" a defendant to  mean those who actually testify at trial, cf. Woodsides v. State, 3 Miss. 655, 664-665, 1 Morr. St. Cas. 95 (1837), those whose statements are offered at trial, see 3 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1397, p 104 (2d ed. 1923) (hereinafter Wigmore), or something in-between, see infra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 192-193.  We must therefore turn to the historical background of the Clause to understand its meaning. 

The right to confront one's accusers is a concept that dates back to Roman times.  See Coy v. Iowa,487 U.S. 1012, 1015, 101 L. Ed. 2d 857, 108 S. Ct. 2798 (1988); Herrmann & Speer, Facing the Accuser: Ancient and Medieval Precursors of the Confrontation Clause, 34 Va. J. Int'l L. 481 (1994).  The founding generation's immediate source of the concept, however, was the common law. English common law has long differed from continental civil law in regard to the manner in which witnesses give testimony in criminal trials.  The common-law tradition is one of live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing, while the civil law condones examination in private by judicial officers.  See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-374 (1768). 

 Nonetheless, England at times adopted elements of the civil-law practice.  Justices of the peace or other officials examined suspects and witnesses before trial.  These examinations were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that "occasioned frequent demands by the prisoner to have his 'accusers,' i.e. the witnesses against him, brought before him face to face." 1 J. Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England 326 (1883).  In some cases, these demands were refused.  See 9 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 216-217, 228 (3d ed. 1944); e.g., Raleigh's Case, 2 How. St. Tr. 1, 15-16, 24 (1603); Throckmorton's Case, 1 How. St. Tr. 869, 875-876 (1554); cf. Lilburn's Case, 3 How. St. Tr. 1315, 1318-1322, 1329 (Star Chamber 1637). 

Pretrial examinations became routine under two statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary in the 16th century, 1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554), and 2 & 3 id., c. 10 (1555).   These Marian bail and committal statutes required justices of the peace to examine suspects and witnesses in felony cases and to certify the results to the court.  It is doubtful that the original purpose of the examinations was to produce evidence admissible at trial.  See J. Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance 21-34 (1974).  Whatever the original purpose, however, they came to be used as evidence in some cases, see 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 284 (1736), resulting in an adoption of continental procedure.  See 4 Holdsworth, supra, at 528-530. 

The most notorious instances of civil-law examination occurred in the great political trials of the 16th and 17th centuries.  One such was the 1603 trial of Sir Walter Raleigh for treason.  Lord Cobham, Raleigh's alleged accomplice, had implicated him in an examination before the Privy Council and in a letter.  At Raleigh's trial, these were read to the jury.  Raleigh argued that Cobham had lied to save himself: "Cobham is absolutely in the King's mercy; to excuse me cannot avail him; by accusing me he may hope for favour." 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832).  Suspecting that Cobham would recant, Raleigh demanded that the judges call him to appear, arguing that "[t]he Proof of the Common Law is by witness and jury: let Cobham be here, let him speak it.  Call my accuser before my face . . . ." 2 How. St. Tr., at 15-16. The judges refused, id., at 24, and, despite Raleigh's protestations that he was being tried "by the Spanish Inquisition," id., at 15, the jury convicted, and Raleigh was sentenced to death. 

One of Raleigh's trial judges later lamented that "'the justice of England has never been so degraded and injured as by the condemnation of Sir Walter Raleigh.'" 1 Jardine, supra, at 520.  Through a series of statutory and judicial reforms, English law developed a right of confrontation that limited these abuses.  For example, treason statutes required witnesses to confront the accused "face to face" at his arraignment.  E.g., 13 Car. 2, c. 1, § 5 (1661); see 1 Hale, supra, at 306. Courts, meanwhile, developed relatively strict rules of unavailability, admitting examinations only if the witness was demonstrably unable to testify in person.  See Lord Morley's Case, 6 How. St. Tr. 769, 770-771 (H. L. 1666); 2 Hale, supra, at 284; 1 Stephen, supra, at 358.  Several authorities also stated that a suspect's confession  could be admitted only against himself, and not against others he implicated.  See 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown c. 46, § 3, pp 603-604 (T. Leach 6th ed. 1787); 1 Hale, supra, at 585, n (k); 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 216 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); cf. Tong's Case, Kel. J. 17, 18, 84 Eng. Rep. 1061, 1062 (1662) (treason).  But see King v Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng. Rep. 108, 109 (1739). 

One recurring question was whether the admissibility of an unavailable witness's pretrial examination depended on whether the defendant had had an opportunity to cross-examine him.  In 1696, the Court of King's Bench answered this question in the affirmative, in the widely reported misdemeanor libel case of King v Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 87 Eng. Rep. 584. The court ruled that, even though a witness was dead, his examination was not admissible where "the defendant not being present when [it was] taken before the mayor . . . had lost the benefit of a cross-examination." Id., at 165, 87 Eng. Rep., at 585. The question was also debated at length during the infamous proceedings against Sir John Fenwick on a bill of attainder.  Fenwick's counsel objected to admitting the examination of a witness who had been spirited away, on the ground that Fenwick had had no opportunity to cross-examine. See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 591-592 (H. C. 1696) (Powys) ("[T]hat which they would offer is something that Mr. Goodman hath sworn when he was examined . . .; sir J. F. not being present or privy, and no opportunity given to cross-examine the person; and I conceive that cannot be offered as evidence . . ."); id., at 592 (Shower) ("[N]o deposition of a person can be read, though beyond sea, unless in cases where the party it is to be read  against was privy to the examination, and might have cross-examined him . . . .  [O]ur constitution is, that the person shall see his accuser").  The examination was nonetheless admitted on a closely divided vote after several of those present opined that the common-law rules of procedure did not apply to parliamentary attainder proceedings--one speaker even admitting that the evidence would normally be inadmissible.  See id., at 603-604 (Williamson); id., at 604-605 (Chancellor of the Exchequer); id., at 607; 3 Wigmore § 1364, at 22-23, n 54.  Fenwick was condemned, but the proceedings "must have burned into the general consciousness the vital importance of the rule securing the right of cross-examination." Id., § 1364, at 22; cf. Carmell v. Texas, 529 U.S. 513, 526-530, 146 L. Ed. 2d 577, 120 S. Ct. 1620 (2000). 

Paine had settled the rule requiring a prior opportunity for cross-examination as a matter of common law, but some doubts remained over whether the Marian statutes prescribed an exception to it in felony cases.  The statutes did not identify the circumstances under which examinations were admissible, see 1 & 2 Phil. & M., c. 13 (1554); 2 & 3 id., c. 10 (1555), and some inferred that no prior opportunity for cross-examination was required.  See Westbeer, supra, at 12, 168 Eng. Rep., at 109; compare Fenwick's Case, 13 How St. Tr., at 596 (Sloane), with id., at 602 (Musgrave).  Many who expressed this view acknowledged that it meant the statutes were in derogation of the common law. See King v Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 710, 100 Eng. Rep. 815, 817 (K. B. 1790) (Grose, J.) (dicta); id., at 722-723, 100 Eng.  Rep., at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.) (same); compare 1 Gilbert, Evidence, at 215 (admissible only "by Force 'of the Statute'"), with id., at 65.  Nevertheless, by 1791 (the year the Sixth Amendment was ratified), courts were applying the cross-examination rule even to examinations by justices of the peace in felony cases.  See King vDingler, 2 Leach 561, 562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791); King v Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353 (1789);  cf. King v Radbourne, 1 Leach 457, 459-461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 331-332 (1787); 3 Wigmore § 1364, at 23.  Early 19th-century treatises confirm that requirement.  See 1 T. Starkie, Evidence 95 (1826); 2 id., at 484-492; T. Peake, Evidence 63-64 (3d ed. 1808).  When Parliament amended the statutes in 1848 to make the requirement explicit, see 11 & 12 Vict., c. 42, § 17, the change merely "introduced in terms" what was already afforded the defendant "by the equitable construction of the law." Queen v Beeston, 29 Eng. L. & Eq. R. 527, 529 (Ct. Crim. App. 1854) (Jervis, C. J.). 2There is some question whether the requirement of a prior opportunity for cross-examination applied as well to statements taken by a coroner, which were also authorized by the Marian statutes.  See 3 Wigmore § 1364, at 23 (requirement "never came to be conceded at all in England"); T. Peake, Evidence 64, n (m) (3d ed. 1808) (not finding the point "expressly decided in any reported case"); State v. Houser, 26 Mo. 431, 436 (1858) ("there may be a few cases . . . but the authority of such cases is questioned, even in [England], by their ablest writers on common law"); State v. Campbell, 30 S.C.L. 124 (1844) (point "has not . . . been plainly adjudged, even in the English cases").  Whatever the English rule, several early American authorities flatly rejected any special status for coroner statements.  See Houser, supra, at 436; Campbell, supra, at 130; T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *318.

  B 

Controversial examination practices were also used in the Colonies.  Early in the 18th century, for example, the Virginia Council protested against the Governor for having "privately issued several commissions to examine witnesses against particular men ex parte," complaining that "the person accused is not admitted to be confronted with, or defend himself against his defamers." A Memorial Concerning the Maladministrations of His Excellency Francis Nicholson, reprinted in 9 English Historical Documents 253, 257 (D. Douglas ed. 1955).  A decade before the Revolution, England gave jurisdiction over Stamp Act offenses to the admiralty courts, which followed civil-law rather than common-law  procedures and thus routinely took testimony by deposition or private judicial examination.  See 5 Geo. 3, c. 12, § 57 (1765); Pollitt, The Right of Confrontation: Its History and Modern Dress, 8 J. Pub. L. 381, 396-397 (1959).  Colonial representatives protested that the Act subverted their rights "by extending the jurisdiction of the courts of admiralty beyond its ancient limits." Resolutions of the Stamp Act Congress§ 8th (Oct. 19, 1765), reprinted in Sources of Our Liberties 270, 271 (R. Perry & J. Cooper eds. 1959).  John Adams, defending a merchant in a high-profile admiralty case, argued: "Examinations of witnesses upon Interrogatories, are only by the Civil Law.  Interrogatories are unknown at common Law, and Englishmen and common Lawyers have an aversion to them if not an Abhorrence of them." Draft of Argument in Sewall v Hancock (1768-1769), in 2 Legal Papers of John Adams 194, 207 (K. Wroth & H. Zobel eds. 1965). 

 Many declarations of rights adopted around the time of the Revolution guaranteed a right of confrontation. See Virginia Declaration of Rights § 8 (1776); Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights § IX (1776); Delaware Declaration of Rights § 14 (1776); Maryland Declaration of Rights § XIX (1776); North Carolina Declaration of Rights § VII (1776); Vermont Declaration of Rights Ch. I, § X (1777); Massachusetts Declaration of Rights § XII (1780); New Hampshire Bill of Rights § XV (1783), all reprinted in 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 235, 265, 278, 282, 287, 323, 342, 377 (1971).  The proposed Federal Constitution, however, did not.  At the Massachusetts ratifying convention, Abraham Holmes objected to this omission precisely on the ground that it would lead to civil-law practices: "The mode of trial is altogether indetermined; . . . whether [the defendant] is to be allowed to confront the witnesses, and have the advantage of cross-examination, we are not yet told.  . . .  [W]e shall find Congress possessed of powers enabling them to institute judicatories little less inauspicious than a certain  tribunal in Spain, . . . the Inquisition." 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 110-111 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1863).  Similarly, a prominent Antifederalist writing under the pseudonym Federal Farmer criticized the use of "written evidence" while objecting to the omission of a vicinage right: "Nothing can be more essential than the cross examining [of] witnesses, and generally before the triers of the facts in question.  . . .  [W]ritten evidence . . . [is] almost useless; it must be frequently taken ex parte, and but very seldom leads to the proper discovery of truth." R. Lee, Letter IV by the Federal Farmer (Oct. 15, 1787), reprinted in 1 Schwartz, supra, at 469, 473.  The First Congress responded by including the Confrontation Clause in the proposal that became the Sixth Amendment.

Early state decisions shed light upon the original understanding of the common-law right.  State v. Webb, 2 N. C. 103 (1794)(per curiam), decided a mere three years after the adoption of the Sixth Amendment, held that depositions could be read against an accused only if they were taken in his presence.  Rejecting a broader reading of the English authorities, the court held: "[I]t is a rule of the common law, founded on natural justice, that no man shall be prejudiced by evidence which he had not the liberty to cross examine." Id., at 104. 

Similarly, in State v. Campbell, 30 S.C.L. 124 (1844), South Carolina's highest law court excluded a deposition taken by a coroner in the absence of the accused.  It held: "[I]f we are to decide the question by the established rules of the common law, there could not be a dissenting voice.  For, notwithstanding the death of the witness, and whatever the respectability of the court taking the depositions, the solemnity of the occasion and the weight of the testimony, such depositions are ex parte, and, therefore, utterly incompetent." Id., at 125.  The court said that one of the "indispensable conditions" implicitly guaranteed by the State Constitution was that "prosecutions be carried on  to the conviction of the accused, by witnesses confronted by him, and subjected to his personal examination." Ibid.

Many other decisions are to the  same effect.  Some early cases went so far as to hold that prior testimony was inadmissible in criminal cases even if the accused had a previous opportunity to cross-examine. See Finn v. Commonwealth, 26 Va. 701, 708 (1827); State v. Atkins, 1 Tenn. 229 (1807)(per curiam).Most courts rejected that view, but only after reaffirming that admissibility depended on a prior opportunity for cross-examination. See United States v. Macomb, 26 F. Cas. 1132, 1133, F. Cas. No. 15702 (No. 15,702) (CC Ill 1851); State v. Houser, 26 Mo. 431, 435-436 (1858); Kendrick v. State, 29 Tenn. 479, 485-488 (1850); Bostick v. State, 22 Tenn. 344, 345-346 (1842); Commonwealth v. Richards, 35 Mass. 434, 437, 18 Pick. 434 (1837); State v. Hill, 20 S.C.L. 607, 608-610 (S. C. 1835); Johnston v. State, 10 Tenn. 58, 59 (1821).Nineteenth-century treatises confirm the rule.  See 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 1093, p 689 (2d ed. 1872); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations *318. 

III 

 This history supports two inferences about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

A 

 First, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.  It was these practices that the Crown deployed in notorious treason cases like Raleigh's; that the Marian statutes invited; that English law's assertion of a right to confrontation was meant to prohibit; and that the founding-era rhetoric decried.  The Sixth Amendment must be interpreted with this focus in mind. 

 Accordingly, we once again reject the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-court testimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements  introduced at trial depends upon "the law of Evidence for the time being." 3 Wigmore § 1397, at 101; accord, Dutton v. Evans,400 U.S. 74, 94, 27 L. Ed. 2d 213, 91 S. Ct. 210 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result).  Leaving the regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices.  Raleigh was, after all, perfectly free to confront those who read Cobham's confession in court. 

 This focus also suggests that not all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment's core concerns.  An off-hand, overheard remark might be unreliable evidence and thus a good candidate for exclusion under hearsay rules, but it bears little resemblance to the civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clause targeted.  On the other hand, ex parte examinations might sometimes be admissible under modern hearsay rules, but the Framers certainly would not have condoned them. 

 The text of the Confrontation Clause reflects this focus.  It applies to "witnesses" against the accused--in other words, those who "bear testimony." 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828).  "Testimony," in turn, is typically "[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact." Ibid. An accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.  The  constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement. 

Various formulations of this core class of "testimonial" statements exist: "ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent--that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially," Brief for Petitioner 23; "extrajudicial statements . . .  contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions," White v. Illinois,502 U.S. 346, 365, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736 (1992) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); "statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial," Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 3.  These formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the Clause's coverage at various levels of abstraction around it.  Regardless of the precise articulation, some statements qualify under any definition--for example, ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing. 

Statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.  Police interrogations bear a striking resemblance to examinations by justices of the peace in England.  The statements are not sworn testimony, but the absence of oath was not dispositive.  Cobham's examination was unsworn, see 1 Jardine, Criminal Trials, at 430, yet Raleigh's trial has long been thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation, see, e.g., Campbell, 30 S.C.L., at 130.  Under the Marian statutes, witnesses were typically put on oath, but suspects were not.  See 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 52.  Yet Hawkins and others went out of their way to caution that such unsworn confessions were not admissible against anyone but the confessor.  See supra, at ____, 158 L.Ed. 2d, at 189.  3These sources--especially Raleigh's trial--refute the Chief Justice's assertion, post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 204-205 (opinion concurring in judgment), that the right of confrontation was not particularly concerned with unsworn testimonial statements.  But even if, as he claims, a general bar on unsworn hearsay made application of the Confrontation Clause to unsworn testimonial statements a moot point, that would merely change our focus from direct evidence of original meaning of the Sixth Amendment to reasonable inference.  We find it implausible that a provision which concededly condemned trial by sworn ex parte affidavit thought trial by unsworn ex parte affidavit perfectly OK.  (The claim that unsworn testimony was self-regulating because jurors would disbelieve it, cf. post, at ____, n 1, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 204, is belied by the very existence of a general bar on unsworn testimony.) Any attempt to determine the application of a constitutional provision to a phenomenon that did not exist at the time of its adoption (here, allegedly, admissible unsworn testimony) involves some degree of estimation--what the Chief Justice calls use of a "proxy," post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 204-205 but that is hardly a reason not to make the estimation as accurate as possible.  Even if, as the Chief Justice mistakenly asserts, there were no direct evidence of how the Sixth Amendment originally applied to unsworn testimony, there is no doubt what its application would have been.

  That interrogators are police officers rather than magistrates does not change the picture either.  Justices of the peace conducting examinations under the Marian statutes were not  magistrates as we understand that office today, but had an essentially investigative and prosecutorial function.  See 1 Stephen, Criminal Law of England, at 221; Langbein, Prosecuting Crime in the Renaissance, at 34-45.  England did not have a professional police force until the 19th century, see 1 Stephen, supra, at 194-200, so it is not surprising that other government officers performed the investigative functions now associated primarily with the police.  The involvement of government officers in the production of testimonial evidence presents the same risk, whether the officers are police or justices of the peace. 

 In sum, even if the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class. 4 We use the term "interrogation" in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense.  Cf. Rhode Island v. Innis,446 U.S. 291, 300-301, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297, 100 S. Ct. 1682 (1980).  Just as various definitions of "testimonial" exist, one can imagine various definitions of "interrogation," and we need not select among them in this case.  Sylvia's recorded statement, knowingly given in response to structured police questioning, qualifies under any conceivable definition.

 B 

 The historical record also supports a second proposition: that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial  statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts.  Rather, the "right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him," Amdt. 6, is most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.  See Mattox v. United States,156 U.S. 237, 243, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337 (1895); cf. Houser, 26 Mo., at 433-435.  As the English authorities above reveal, the common law in 1791 conditioned admissibility of an absent witness's examination on unavailability and a prior opportunity to cross-examine. The Sixth Amendment therefore incorporates those limitations.  The numerous early state decisions applying the same test confirm that these principles were received as part of the common law in this country. 5The Chief Justice claims that English law's treatment of testimonial statements was inconsistent at the time of the framing, post, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 205-206, but the examples he cites relate to examinations under the Marian statutes.  As we have explained, to the extent Marian examinations were admissible, it was only because the statutes derogated from the common law. See supra, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 189-190.  Moreover, by 1791 even the statutory-derogation view had been rejected with respect to justice-of-the-peace examinations--explicitly in King v Woodcock, 1 Leach 500, 502-504, 168 Eng. Rep. 352, 353 (1789), and King v Dingler, 2 Leach 561, 562-563, 168 Eng. Rep. 383, 383-384 (1791), and by implication in King v Radbourne, 1 Leach 457, 459-461, 168 Eng. Rep. 330, 331-332 (1787). None of the Chief Justice's citations proves otherwise.  King v Westbeer, 1 Leach 12, 168 Eng. Rep. 108 (1739), was decided a half century earlier and cannot be taken as an accurate statement of the law in 1791 given the directly contrary holdings of Woodcock and Dingler. Hale's treatise is older still, and far more ambiguous on this point, see 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 585-586 (1736); some who espoused the requirement of a prior opportunity for cross-examination thought it entirely consistent with Hale's views.  See Fenwick's Case, 13 How. St. Tr. 537, 602 (H. C. 1696) (Musgrave).  The only timely authority the Chief Justice cites is King v Eriswell, 3 T. R. 707, 100 Eng. Rep. 815 (K. B. 1790), but even that decision provides no substantial support.  Eriswell was not a criminal case at all, but a Crown suit against the inhabitants of a town to charge them with care of an insane pauper.  Id., at 707-708, 100 Eng. Rep., at 815-816.  It is relevant only because the judges discuss the Marian statutes in dicta.  One of them, Buller, J., defended admission of the pauper's statement of residence on the basis of authorities that purportedly held ex parte Marian examinations admissible. Id., at 713-714, 100 Eng. Rep., at 819.  As evidence writers were quick to point out, however, his authorities said no such thing.  See Peake, Evidence, at 64, n (m) ("Mr. J. Buller is reported to have said that it was so settled in 1 Lev. 180, and Kel. 55; certainly nothing of the kind appears in those books"); 2 T. Starkie, Evidence 487-488, n (c) (1826) ("Buller, J. . . . refers to Radbourne's case . . .; but in that case the deposition was taken in the hearing of the prisoner, and of course the question did not arise" (citation omitted)).  Two other judges, Grose, J., and Kenyon, C. J., responded to Buller's argument by distinguishing Marian examinations as a statutory exception to the common-law rule, but the context and tenor of their remarks suggest they merely assumed the accuracy of Buller's premise without independent consideration, at least with respect to examinations by justices of the peace. See 3 T. R., at 710, 100 Eng. Rep., at 817 (Grose, J.); id., at 722-723, 100 Eng. Rep., at 823-824 (Kenyon, C. J.).  In fact, the case reporter specifically notes in a footnote that their assumption was erroneous.  See id., at 710, n (c),100 Eng. Rep., at 817, n (c). Notably, Buller's position on pauper examinations was resoundingly rejected only a decade later in King v Ferry Frystone, 2 East 54, 55, 102 Eng. Rep. 289 (K. B. 1801) ("The point . . . has been since considered to be so clear against the admissibility of the evidence . . . that it was abandoned by the counsel . . . without argument"), further suggesting that his views on evidence were not mainstream at the time of the framing. In short, none of the Chief Justice's sources shows that the law in 1791 was unsettled even as to examinations by justices of the peace under the Marian statutes. More importantly, however, even if the statutory rule in 1791 were in doubt, the numerous early state-court decisions make abundantly clear that the Sixth Amendment incorporated the common-law right of confrontation and not any exceptions the Marian statutes supposedly carved out from it.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 191-192; see also supra, at ____, n 2, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 190 (coroner statements).  The common-law rule had been settled since Paine in 1696.  See King v Paine, 5 Mod. 163, 165, 87 Eng. Rep. 584, 585 (K. B.).

 We do not read the historical sources to say that a prior opportunity  to cross-examine was merely a sufficient, rather than a necessary, condition for admissibility of testimonial statements.  They suggest that this requirement was dispositive,  and not merely one of several ways to establish reliability. This is not to deny, as the Chief Justice notes, that "[t]here were always exceptions to the general rule of exclusion" of hearsay evidence. Post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 206.  Several had become well established by 1791.  See 3 Wigmore § 1397, at 101; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13, n 5.  But there is scant evidence that exceptions were invoked to admit testimonial statements against the accused in a criminal case. 6The one deviation we have found involves dying declarations.  The existence of that exception as a general rule of criminal hearsay law cannot be disputed.  See, e.g., Mattox v. United States,156 U.S. 237, 243-244, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337 (1895); King v Reason, 16 How. St. Tr. 1, 24-38 (K. B. 1722); 1 D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832); Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, at *318; 1 G. Gilbert, Evidence 211 (C. Lofft ed. 1791); see also F. Heller, The Sixth Amendment 105 (1951) (asserting that this was the only recognized criminal hearsay exception at common law).  Although many dying declarations may not be testimonial, there is authority for admitting even those that clearly are.  See Woodcock, supra, at 501-504, 168 Eng. Rep., at 353-354; Reason, supra, at 24-38; Peake, supra, at 64; cf. Radbourne, supra, at 460-462, 168 Eng. Rep., at 332-333.  We need not decide in this case whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates an exception for testimonial dying declarations.  If this exception must be accepted on historical grounds, it is sui generis. Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature were not testimonial--for example, business records  or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.  We do not infer from these that the Framers thought exceptions would apply even to prior testimony.  Cf. Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116, 134, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117, 119 S. Ct. 1887 (1999) (plurality opinion) ("[A]ccomplices' confessions that inculpate a criminal defendant are not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule"). 7 We cannot agree with the Chief Justice that the fact "[t]hat a statement might be testimonial does nothing to undermine the wisdom of one of these [hearsay] exceptions." Post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 206-207.  Involvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse--a fact borne out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.  This consideration does not evaporate when testimony happens to fall within some broad, modern hearsay exception, even if that exception might be justifiable in other circumstances.

 IV 

 Our case law has been largely consistent with these two principles.  Our leading early decision, for example, involved a deceased witness's prior trial testimony.  Mattox v. United States,156 U.S. 237, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337 (1895).  In allowing the statement to be admitted, we relied on the fact that the defendant had had, at the first trial, an adequate opportunity to confront the witness: "The substance of the constitutional protection is preserved to the prisoner in the advantage he has once had of seeing the witness face to face, and of subjecting him to the ordeal of a cross-examination. This, the law says, he shall under no circumstances be deprived of . . . ." Id., at 244, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337. 

Our later cases conform to Mattox's holding that prior trial or preliminary hearing testimony is admissible only if the defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine. See Mancusi v. Stubbs,408 U.S. 204, 213-216, 33 L. Ed. 2d 293, 92 S. Ct. 2308 (1972); California v. Green,399 U.S. 149, 165-168, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489, 90 S. Ct. 1930 (1970); Pointer v. Texas,380 U.S., at 406-408, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923, 85 S. Ct. 1065; cf. Kirby v. United States,174 U.S. 47, 55-61, 43 L. Ed. 890, 19 S. Ct. 574 (1899).  Even where the defendant had such an opportunity,  we excluded the testimony where the government had not established unavailability of the witness.  See Barber v. Page,390 U.S. 719, 722-725, 20 L. Ed. 2d 255, 88 S. Ct. 1318 (1968); cf. Motes v. United States,178 U.S. 458, 470-471, 44 L. Ed. 1150, 20 S. Ct. 993 (1900).  We similarly excluded accomplice confessions where the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine. See Roberts v. Russell,392 U.S. 293, 294-295, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1100, 88 S. Ct. 1921 (1968)(per curiam); Bruton v. United States,391 U.S. 123, 126-128, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968);Douglas v. Alabama,380 U.S. 415, 418-420, 13 L. Ed. 2d 934, 85 S. Ct. 1074 (1965).  In contrast, we considered reliability factors beyond prior opportunity for cross-examination when the hearsay statement at issue was not testimonial. See Dutton v. Evans,400 U.S., at 87-89, 27 L. Ed. 2d213, 91 S. Ct. 210 (plurality opinion). 

 Even our recent cases, in their outcomes, hew closely to the traditional line.  Ohio v. Roberts,448 U.S., at 67-70, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597, 100 S. Ct. 2531, admitted testimony from a preliminary hearing at which the defendant had examined the witness.  Lilly v Virginia, supra, excluded testimonial statements that the defendant had had no opportunity to test by cross-examination. And Bourjaily v.  United States,483 U.S. 171, 181-184, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144, 107 S. Ct. 2775 (1987), admitted statements made unwittingly to an FBI informant after applying a more general test that did not make prior cross-examination an indispensable requirement. 8One case arguably in tension with the rule requiring a prior opportunity for cross-examination when the proffered statement is testimonial is White v. Illinois,502 U.S. 346, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736 (1992), which involved, inter alia, statements of a child victim to an investigating police officer admitted as spontaneous declarations.  Id., at 349-35, 1116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736.  It is questionable whether testimonial statements would ever have been admissible on that ground in 1791; to the extent the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations existed at all, it required that the statements be made "immediat[ely] upon the hurt received, and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contrive any thing for her own advantage." Thompson v Trevanion, Skin. 402, 90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K. B. 1693). In any case, the only question presented in White was whether the Confrontation Clause imposed an unavailability requirement on the types of hearsay at issue.  See 502 U.S., at 348-349, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736.  The holding did not address the question whether certain of the statements, because they were testimonial, had to be excluded even if the witness was unavailable.  We "[took] as a given . . . that the testimony properly falls within the relevant hearsay exceptions." Id., at 351, n. 4, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736.

Lee v. Illinois,476 U.S. 530, 90 L. Ed. 2d 514, 106 S. Ct. 2056 (1986), on which the State relies, is not to the contrary.  There, we rejected the State's attempt to admit an accomplice confession. The State had argued that the confession was admissible because it "interlocked" with the defendant's.  We dealt with the argument by rejecting its premise, holding that "when the discrepancies between the statements are not insignificant, the codefendant's confession may not be admitted." Id., at 545, 90 L. Ed. 2d 514, 106 S. Ct. 2056.  Respondent argues that "[t]he logical inference of this statement  is that when the discrepancies between the statements are insignificant, then the codefendant's statement may be admitted." Brief for Respondent 6.  But this is merely a possible inference, not an inevitable one, and we do not draw it here.  If Lee had meant authoritatively to announce an exception--previously unknown to this Court's jurisprudence--for interlocking confessions, it would not have done so in such an oblique manner.  Our only precedent on interlocking confessions had addressed the entirely different question whether a limiting instruction cured prejudice to codefendants from admitting a defendant's own confession against him in a joint trial.  See Parker v. Randolph,442 U.S. 62, 69-76, 60 L. Ed. 2d 713, 99 S. Ct. 2132 (1979) (plurality opinion), abrogated by Cruz v. New York,481 U.S. 186, 95 L. Ed. 2d 162, 107 S. Ct. 1714 (1987). 

 Our cases have thus remained faithful to the Framers' understanding: Testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. 9The Chief Justice complains that our prior decisions have "never drawn a distinction" like the one we now draw, citing in particular Mattox v. United States,156 U.S. 237, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337 (1895), Kirby v. United States,174 U.S. 47, 43 L. Ed. 890, 19 S. Ct. 574 (1899), and United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, F. Cas. No. 14694 (No. 14,694) (CC Va 1807) (Marshall, C. J.). Post, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 205-207.  But nothing in these cases contradicts our holding in any way.  Mattox and Kirby allowed or excluded evidence depending on whether the defendant had had an opportunity for cross-examination. Mattox, supra, at 242-244, 39 L. Ed. 409, 15 S. Ct. 337; Kirby, supra, at 55-61, 43 L. Ed. 890, 19 S. Ct. 574.  That the two cases did not extrapolate a more general class of evidence to which that criterion applied does not prevent us from doing so now.  As to Burr, we disagree with the Chief Justice's reading of the case.  Although Chief Justice Marshall made one passing reference to the Confrontation Clause, the case was fundamentally about the hearsay rules governing statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.  The "principle so truly important" on which "inroad[s]" had been introduced was the "rule of evidence which rejects mere hearsay testimony." See 25 F. Cas., at 193.  Nothing in the opinion concedes exceptions to the Confrontation Clause's exclusion of testimonial statements as we use the term.  The Chief Justice fails to identify a single case (aside from one minor, arguable exception, see supra, at ____, n 8, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 197), where we have admitted testimonial statements based on indicia of reliability other than a prior opportunity for cross-examination. If nothing else, the test we announce is an empirically accurate explanation of the results our cases have reached.  Finally, we reiterate that, when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.  See California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 162, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489, 90 S. Ct. 1930 (1970).  It is therefore irrelevant that the reliability of some out-of-court statements "'cannot be replicated, even if the declarant testifies to the same matters in court.'" Post, at ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 206-207 (quoting United States v. Inadi,475 U.S. 387, 395, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390, 106 S. Ct. 1121 (1986)).  The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it.  (The Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.  See Tennessee v. Street,471 U.S. 409, 414, 85 L. Ed. 2d 425, 105 S. Ct. 2078 (1985).)

   V 

Although the results of our decisions have generally been faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same cannot be said of our rationales.  Roberts conditions the admissibility of all hearsay evidence on whether it falls under a "firmly rooted hearsay exception" or bears "particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." 448 U.S., at 66, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597, 100 S. Ct. 2531.  This test departs from the historical principles identified above in two respects.  First, it is too broad: It applies the same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of ex parte testimony.  This often results in close constitutional scrutiny in cases that are far removed from the core concerns of the Clause.  At the same time, however, the test is too narrow: It admits statements that do consist of ex parte testimony upon a mere finding of reliability. This malleable standard often fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations. 

Members of this Court and academics have suggested that we revise our doctrine to reflect more accurately the original understanding of the Clause.  See, e.g., Lilly,527 U.S., at 140-143, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117, 119 S. Ct 1887 (Breyer, J., concurring); White, 502 U.S., at 366, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); A. Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure 125-131 (1997); Friedman, Confrontation: The Search for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L. J. 1011 (1998).  They offer two proposals: First, that we apply the Confrontation Clause only to testimonial statements, leaving the remainder to regulation by hearsay law--thus eliminating the overbreadth referred to above.  Second, that we impose an absolute bar to statements that are testimonial, absent a prior opportunity to cross-examine--thus eliminating the excessive narrowness referred to above. 

In White, we considered the first proposal and rejected it.  502 U.S., at 352-353, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848, 112 S. Ct. 736.  Although our analysis in this  case casts doubt on that holding, we need not definitively resolve whether it survives our decision today, because Sylvia Crawford's statement is testimonial under any definition.  This case does, however, squarely implicate the second proposal. 

A 

 Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment's protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of "reliability." Certainly none of the authorities discussed above acknowledges any general reliability exception to the common-law rule.  Admitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause's ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee.  It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.  Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 ("This open examination of witnesses . . . is  much more conducive to the clearing up of truth"); M. Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (adversarial testing "beats and bolts out the Truth much better"). 

 TheRoberts test allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability. It thus replaces the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.  In this respect, it is very different from exceptions to the Confrontation Clause that make no claim to be a surrogate means of assessing reliability. For example, the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds; it does not purport to be an alternative means of determining reliability. See Reynolds v. United States,98 U.S. 145, 158-159, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1879). 

The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliability determinations that Roberts authorizes.  In the face of Raleigh's repeated demands for confrontation, the prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applying Roberts might invoke today: that Cobham's statements were self-inculpatory, 2 How. St. Tr., at 19, that they were not made in the heat of passion, id., at 14, and that they were not "extracted from [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon," id., at 29.  It is not plausible that the Framers' only objection to the trial was that Raleigh's judges did not properly weigh these factors before sentencing him to death.  Rather, the problem was that the judges refused to allow Raleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he could cross-examine him and try to expose his accusation as a lie. 

 Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.  This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes. 

 B 

The legacy ofRoberts in other courts vindicates the Framers' wisdom in rejecting a general reliability exception.   The framework is so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations. 

Reliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept.  There are countless factors bearing on whether a statement is reliable; the nine-factor balancing test applied by the Court of Appeals below is representative.  See, e.g., People v. Farrell, 34 P. 3d 401, 406-407 (Colo. 2001) (eight-factor test).  Whether a statement is deemed reliable depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them.  Some courts wind up attaching the same significance to opposite facts.  For example, the Colorado Supreme Court held a statement more reliable because its inculpation of the defendant was "detailed," id., at 407, while the Fourth Circuit found a statement more reliable because the portion implicating another was "fleeting," United States v. Photogrammetric Data Servs., 259 F.3d 229, 245 (2001).  The Virginia Court of Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness was in custody and charged with a crime (thus making the statement more obviously against her penal interest), see Nowlin v. Commonwealth, 40 Va. App. 327, 335-338, 579 S. E. 2d 367, 371-372 (2003), while the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found a statement more reliable because the witness was not in custody and not a suspect, see State v. Bintz, 2002 WI App. 204, P13, 257 Wis. 2d 177, 187, 650 N.W.2d 913, 918.  Finally, the Colorado Supreme Court in one case found a statement more reliable because it was given "immediately after" the events at issue, Farrell, supra, at 407, while that same court, in another case, found a statement more reliable because two years had elapsed, Stevens v. People, 29 P. 3d 305, 316 (2001).

The unpardonable vice of theRoberts test, however, is not its unpredictability, but its demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.  Despite the plurality's speculation in Lilly, 527 U.S., at 137, 144 L. Ed. 2d 117, 119 S. Ct. 1887, that it was "highly unlikely" that  accomplice confessions implicating the accused could survive Roberts, courts continue routinely to admit them.  See Photogrammetric Data Servs., supra, at 245-246; Farrell, supra, at 406-408; Stevens, supra, at 314-318; Taylor v. Commonwealth, 63 S. W. 3d 151, 166-168 (Ky. 2001); State v. Hawkins, 2002 Ohio 7347, No. 2001-P-0060, 2002 WL 31895118, PP34-37, *6 (Ohio App., Dec. 31, 2002); Bintz, supra, PP7-14, 257 Wis. 2d, at 183-188, 650 N. W. 2d, at 916-918; People v. Lawrence, 55 P. 3d 155, 160-161 (Colo. App. 2001); State v. Jones, 171 Ore. App. 375, 387-391, 15 P. 3d 616, 623-625 (2000); State v. Marshall, 136 Ohio App. 3d 742, 747-748, 737 N.E.2d 1005, 1009 (2000); People v. Schutte, 240 Mich. App. 713, 718-721, 613 N.W.2d 370, 376-377 (2000);People v. Thomas, 313 Ill. App. 3d 998, 1005-1007, 730 N.E.2d 618, 625-626, 246 Ill. Dec. 593 (2000); cf. Nowlin, supra, at 335-338, 579 S. E. 2d, at 371-372 (witness confessed to a related crime); People v. Campbell, 309 Ill. App. 3d 423, 431-432, 721 N.E.2d 1225, 1230, 242 Ill. Dec. 694 (1999) (same).  One recent study found that, after Lilly, appellate courts admitted accomplice statements to the authorities in 25 out of  70 cases--more than one-third of the time.  Kirst, Appellate Court Answers to the Confrontation Questions in Lilly v. Virginia, 53 Syracuse L. Rev. 87, 105 (2003).  Courts have invoked Roberts to admit other sorts of plainly testimonial statements despite the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine. See United States v. Aguilar, 295 F.3d 1018, 1021-1023 (CA9 2002) (plea allocution showing existence of a conspiracy); United States v. Centracchio, 265 F.3d 518, 527-530 (CA7 2001) (same); United States v. Dolah, 245 F.3d 98, 104-105 (CA2 2001) (same); United States v. Petrillo, 237 F.3d 119, 122-123 (CA2 2000) (same); United States v. Moskowitz, 215 F.3d 265, 268-269 (CA2 2000) (same); United States v. Gallego, 191 F.3d 156, 166-168 (CA2 1999) (same); United States v. Papajohn, 212 F.3d 1112, 1118-1120 (CA8 2000) (grand jury testimony); United States v. Thomas, 30 Fed. Appx. 277, 279 (CA4 2002) (same); Bintz, supra, PP15-22, 257 Wis. 2d, at 188-191,  650 N. W. 2d, at 918-920 (prior trial testimony); State v. McNeill, 140 N. C. App. 450, 457-460, 537 S. E. 2d 518, 523-524 (2000) (same). 

To add insult to injury, some of the courts that admit untested testimonial statements find reliability in the very factors that make the statements testimonial. As noted earlier, one court relied on the fact that the witness's statement was made to police while in custody on pending charges--the theory being that this made the statement more clearly against penal interest and thus more reliable. Nowlin, supra, at 335-338, 579 S. E. 2d, at 371-372.  Other courts routinely rely on the fact that a prior statement is given under oath in judicial proceedings.  E.g., Gallego, supra, at 168 (plea allocution); Papajohn, supra , at 1120 (grand jury testimony).  That inculpating statements are given in a testimonial setting is not an antidote to the confrontation problem, but rather the trigger that makes the Clause's demands most urgent.  It is not enough to point out that most of the usual safeguards of the adversary process attend the statement, when the single safeguard missing is the one the Confrontation Clause demands. 

C 

Roberts' failings were on full display in the proceedings below.  Sylvia Crawford made her statement while in police custody, herself a potential suspect in the case.  Indeed, she had been told that whether she would be released "depend[ed] on how the investigation continues." App. 81.  In response to often leading questions from police detectives, she implicated her husband in Lee's stabbing and at least arguably undermined his self-defense claim.  Despite all this, the trial court admitted her statement, listing several reasons why it was reliable. In its opinion reversing, the Court of Appeals listed several other reasons why the statement was not reliable. Finally, the State Supreme Court relied exclusively on the interlocking character of the  statement and disregarded every other factor the lower courts had considered.  The case is thus a self-contained demonstration of Roberts' unpredictable and inconsistent application. 

Each of the courts also made assumptions that cross-examination might well have undermined.  The trial court, for example, stated that Sylvia Crawford's statement was reliable because she was an eyewitness with direct knowledge of the  events.  But Sylvia at one point told the police that she had "shut [her] eyes and . . . didn't really watch" part of the fight, and that she was "in shock." App. 134.  The trial court also buttressed its reliability finding by claiming that Sylvia was "being questioned by law enforcement, and, thus, the [questioner] is . . . neutral to her and not someone who would be inclined to advance her interests and shade her version of the truth unfavorably toward the defendant." Id., at 77.  The Framers would be astounded to learn that ex parte testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was elicited by "neutral" government officers.  But even if the court's assessment of the officer's motives was accurate, it says nothing about Sylvia's perception of her situation.  Only cross-examination could reveal that. 

 The State Supreme Court gave dispositive weight to the interlocking nature of the two statements--that they were both ambiguous as to when and whether Lee had a weapon.  The court's claim that the two statements were equally ambiguous is hard to accept.  Petitioner's statement is ambiguous only in the sense that he had lingering doubts about his recollection: "A. I coulda swore I seen him goin' for somethin' before, right before everything happened.  . . .  [B]ut I'm not positive." Id., at 155.  Sylvia's statement, on the other hand, is truly inscrutable, since the key timing detail was simply assumed in the leading question she was asked: "Q. Did Kenny do anything to fight back from this assault?" Id., at 137.  Moreover, Sylvia specifically  said Lee had nothing in his hands after he was stabbed, while petitioner was not asked about that. 

The prosecutor obviously did not share the court's view that Sylvia's statement was ambiguous--he called it "damning evidence" that "completely refutes [petitioner's] claim of self-defense." Tr. 468 (Oct. 21, 1999).  We have no way of knowing whether the jury agreed with the prosecutor or the court.  Far from obviating the need for cross-examination, the "interlocking" ambiguity of the two statements made it all the more imperative that they be tested to tease out the truth. 

We readily concede that we could resolve this case by simply reweighing the "reliability factors" under Roberts and finding that Sylvia Crawford's statement falls short.  But we view this as one of those rare cases in which the result below is so improbable that it reveals a fundamental failure on our part to interpret the Constitution in a way that secures its intended constraint on judicial discretion.  Moreover, to reverse the Washington Supreme Court's decision after conducting our own reliability analysis would perpetuate, not avoid, what the Sixth Amendment condemns.  The Constitution prescribes a procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own devising. 

We have no doubt that the courts below were acting in utmost good faith when they found reliability. The Framers, however, would not have been content to indulge this assumption.  They knew that judges, like other government officers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rights of the people; the likes of the dread Lord Jeffreys were not yet too distant a memory.  They were  loath to leave too much discretion in judicial hands.  Cf. U.S. Const., Amdt. 6 (criminal jury trial); Amdt. 7 (civil jury trial); Ring v. Arizona,536 U.S. 584, 611-612, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002) (Scalia, J., concurring).  By replacing categorical constitutional guarantees with  open-ended balancing tests, we do violence to their design.  Vague standards are manipulable, and, while that might be a small concern in run-of-the-mill assault prosecutions like this one, the Framers had an eye toward politically charged cases like Raleigh's--great state trials where the impartiality of even those at the highest levels of the judiciary might not be so clear.  It is difficult to imagine Roberts' providing any meaningful protection in those circumstances. * * * 

Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers' design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law--as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.  Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination. We leave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of "testimonial." 10We acknowledge the Chief Justice's objection, post, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 207-208, that our refusal to articulate a comprehensive definition in this case will cause interim uncertainty.  But it can hardly be any worse than the status quo.  See supra, at ____ - ____, 158 L. Ed. 2d, at 200-201, and cases cited.  The difference is that the Roberts test is inherently, and therefore permanently, unpredictable. Whatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations. These are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed. 

 In this case, the State admitted Sylvia's testimonial statement against petitioner, despite the fact that he had no opportunity to cross-examine her.  That alone is sufficient to make out a violation of the Sixth Amendment.Robertsnotwithstanding, we decline to mine the record in search of indicia of reliability. Where testimonial statements are at  issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation. 

The judgment of the Washington Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.  


Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court. 

Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code states that, except as otherwise provided, "the amount of any tax imposed by this title shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed . . . and no proceeding in court without assessment for the collection of such tax shall be begun after the expiration of such period." 26 U.S.C. § 6501(a) [26 USCS § 6501(a)].  If a tax is properly assessed within three years, however, the statute of limitations for the collection of the tax is extended by 10 years from the date of assessment. § 6502(a).  We must decide in this case whether, in order for the United States to avail itself of the 10-year increase in the statute of limitations for collection of a tax debt, it must assess the taxes not only against a partnership that is directly liable for the debt, but also against each individual partner who might be jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership.  Under California law a partnership maintains a separate identity from its general partners, and the partners are only secondarily liable for the tax debts of the partnership, as they are for any debt of the partnership. Because, in this case, the only relevant "taxpayer" for purposes of §§ 6501-6502 is the partnership, we hold that the proper assessment of the tax against the partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations for collection of the tax from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the partnership's debts.  The Government's timely assessment of the tax against the partnership was sufficient to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding, whether from the partnership itself or from those liable for its debts. 

 I 

Respondents, Abel Cosmo Galletti, Sarah Galletti, Francesco Briguglio, and Angela Briguglio, were general partners of Marina Cabrillo Company (Partnership).  From 1992 to 1995, the Partnership failed to pay significant federal employment tax liabilities that it had incurred.  Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) timely assessed those taxes against the Partnership in 1994, 1995, and 1996, the Partnership never satisfied the debt. 

Respondents Abel and Sarah Galletti and respondents Francesco and Angela Briguglio filed joint petitions for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 20, 1999, and February 4, 2000, respectively.  In the Gallettis' proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the amount of $395,179.89 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between January 1994 and July 1995 against  the Partnership. In the Briguglios' proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the amount of $427,402.74.  The proof of claim included secured claims totaling $403,264.06 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between January 1994 and November 1996 against the Partnership. 

Respondents objected to the claims on the ground that they were not proven against the estates.  Respondents did not dispute that under California law they are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the Partnership. Nor did they dispute that the IRS had properly assessed the taxes against the Partnership within the 3-year statute of limitations, thereby extending the limitations period for collection of the taxes by 10 years.  Rather, respondents argued that the timely assessment of the Partnership extended the statute of limitations only against the Partnership. To extend the 3-year statute of limitations against the general partners, respondents argued, the IRS had to separately assess the general partners within the 3-year limitations period. Because it did not, and because the 3-year limitations period  had expired, respondents argued that the IRS could no longer collect the debt from them.  The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents' objections to the claims. 

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Government argued that the Code does not require that the individual partners be assessed within the 3-year period prescribed by § 6501 and that the IRS made a valid assessment of the taxpayer here because the Partnership is the only relevant "taxpayer." The Court of Appeals held that since respondents are "taxpayers" under § 7701(a)(14), which defines "taxpayer" to mean "any person subject to any internal revenue tax," they are also "taxpayers" under §§ 6203 and 6501.  As such, the Court of Appeals held that "[t]he assessment against the Partnership extended the statute of limitations only with respect to the Partnership." 314 F.3d 336, 340 (2002). 

The Government argued in the alternative that because respondents conceded that they were liable for the Partnership's employment tax debts as a matter of California law, the Government had a right to payment, which suffices to prove a valid claim in bankruptcy.  See 11 U.S.C. § 101(5)(A) [11 USCS § 101(5)(A)] (defining "claim" as including a "right to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured").  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument because, under California law, a creditor must obtain a judgment against a partner before holding that partner liable for the partnership's debt.  Cal. Corp. Code Ann. § 16307(c) (Supp.  2004).  At the time the United States filed its proof of claim, it had not obtained a separate judgment against respondents, and the time for obtaining a judgment under the Internal Revenue Code against respondents had expired. 

We granted certiorari, 539 U.S. 940, 156 L. Ed. 2d 626, 123 S. Ct. 2606 (2003), and now reverse.

Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that "the amount of any tax imposed [by the Code] shall be assessed within 3  years after the return was filed." 26 U.S.C. § 6501(a) [26 USCS § 6501(a)].  "The assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary [of the Treasury] in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary." § 6203.  Within 60 days of the assessment, the Secretary is required to "give notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof." § 6303(a).  If the tax is properly assessed within 3 years, the limitations period for collection of the tax is extended by 10 years from the date of the assessment.  § 6502. 

 The dispute in this case centers on whether the United States can collect the Partnership's unpaid employment taxes from respondents in a judicial proceeding occurring more than three years after the tax return was filed but within the 10-year extension to the 3-year limitations period that attached when the tax was timely assessed against the Partnership. 1Because the Government is attempting to enforce the Partnership's tax liabilities against respondents in a judicial proceeding, we do not address whether an assessment only against the Partnership is sufficient for the IRS to commence administrative collection of the Partnership's tax debts by lien or levy against respondents' property. We also decline to address whether an assessment against the partnership suffices to trigger liability against the partners for interest and penalties without separate notice and demand to them. Respondents insist that a valid assessment (that is, one that would trigger the 10-year increase in the statute of limitations) must name them individually. This is so, according to respondents, because they are primarily liable for the tax debt, both because they are "the [relevant] taxpayer[s]" under § 6203 and because they are jointly and  severally liable for the tax debts of the Partnership. 2 Respondents argue that even if we were to hold that the partners are secondarily liable, the IRS would still be barred from collecting the taxes.  Respondents contend that if partners are not "taxpayers" under § 6203, then their liability arises only under state law, and the state 3-year statute of limitations therefore applies.  Brief for Respondents 30-34.  Respondents have forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in the courts below.  Indeed, the closest respondents have come to arguing that the state limitations period applies was in the Court of Appeals, when respondents argued that "under California law, any collections suit filed against a partner to collect a partnership debt is subject to the statute limitation provision which applies to the underlying debt of the partnership." Brief for Respondents in Nos. 01-55953, 01-55954 (CA9), p 14.  This argument, of course, is contrary to respondents' position in this Court. We reject both arguments in turn. 

A 

 Respondents argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that each partner is primarily liable for the debt and must be individually assessed because each partner is a separate "taxpayer" under 26 U.S.C. § 6203 [26 USCS § 6203].  The statutory definition of "taxpayer" includes "any person subject to any internal revenue tax," and "person" includes both "an individual" and a "partnership," §§ 7701(a)(14), (a)(1).  The Court of Appeals observed that although the Partnership is a "taxpayer," each individual partner is also a separate "taxpayer." As such, the Court of Appeals interpreted § 6203's requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury record "the liability of the taxpayer" to require a separate assessment against each of the general partners. 

 Although the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that an individual partner can be a "taxpayer," the inquiry does not end there.  Section 6203 speaks of "the liability of the taxpayer" (emphasis added), which indicates that the relevant taxpayer must be determined.  The liability in this case arose from the Partnership's failure to comply with § 3402(a)(1) of the Code, which requires "every employer  making payment of wages" to deduct and withhold employment taxes.  Moreover, "[t]he employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld." § 3403.  When an employer fails to withhold and submit the requisite amount of employment taxes, § 3403 makes clear that the liable taxpayer is the employer.  In this case, the "employer" was the Partnership. 3 Our decision is consistent with this Court's holding in United States v. Williams,514 U.S. 527, 532-536, 131 L. Ed. 2d 608, 115 S. Ct. 1611 (1995), where we interpreted "taxpayer" under 26 U.S.C. § 6511 [26 USCS § 6511] more broadly.  Here, it is clear that we must interpret "the taxpayer" under § 6203 with reference to the underlying liability.

B 

Respondents also argue that they are primarily liable for the Partnership's tax debt because, under California law, general partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of their partnership, Cal. Corp. Code Ann. § 16306 (Supp. 2004).  Brief for Respondents 8-16.  As our prior discussion demonstrates, however, respondents cannot show that they are primarily liable for the payment of the Partnership's employment taxes unless they can show that they are the "employer." However, under California's partnership principles, a partnership and its general partners are separate entities. See Cal. Corp. Code Ann. § 16201 (Supp. 2004).  Thus respondents cannot argue that, for all intents and purposes, imposing a tax directly on the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly on the general partners. Respondents must instead prove that the tax liability was imposed both on the Partnership and respondents as separate "employers." The fact that respondents are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the Partnership is irrelevant to this determination. 

III 

 We now turn to the question whether the Government must make separate assessments of a single tax debt against persons or entities secondarily liable for that debt in order  for § 6502's extended statute of limitations to apply to those persons or entities. 4 We use the term "secondary liability" to mean liability that is derived from the original or primary liability. We hold that the Code contains no such requirement.  Respondents' argument that they must be separately assessed turns on a mistaken understanding of the function and nature of an assessment as identical to the initiation of a formal collection action against any person or entity who might be liable for payment of a debt.  In its numerous uses throughout the Code, it is clear that the term "assessment" refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability. See, e.g.,26 U.S.C. § 6201 [26 USCS § 6201] (assessment authority); § 6203 (method of assessment); § 6204 (supplemental assessments); 26 CFR § 601.103 (2003).  See  also Black's Law Dictionary 111 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "assessment" as the "[d]etermination of the [tax] rate or amount of something, such as a tax or damages").  "The Federal tax system is basically one of self-assessment," whereby each taxpayer computes the tax due and then files the appropriate form of return along with the requisite payment.  26 CFR § 601.103(a) (2003).  In most cases, the Secretary accepts the self-assessment and simply records the liability of the taxpayer.  Where the taxpayer fails to file the form of return or miscalculates the tax due, as in this case, the Secretary can assess "all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties)," 26 U.S.C. § 6201(a) [26 USCS § 6201(a)], by "recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary," § 6203.  In other words, where the Secretary rejects the self-assessment of the taxpayer or discovers that the taxpayer has failed to file a return, the Secretary calculates the proper amount of liability and records it in the Government's books. 

 To be sure, the assessment of a tax triggers certain consequences.  After the amount of liability has been established and recorded, the IRS can employ administrative enforcement methods to collect the tax.  §§ 6321-6327, 6331-6334.   The assessment of a tax liability also extends the period during which the Government can collect the tax.  But the fact that the act of assessment has consequences does not change the function of the assessment: to calculate and record a tax liability. 

 Under a proper understanding of the function and nature of an assessment, it is clear that it is the tax that is assessed, not the taxpayer.  See § 6501(a) ("the amount of any tax . . . shall be assessed"); § 6502(a) ("[w]here the assessment of any tax").  And in United States v. Updike,281 U.S. 489, 74 L. Ed. 984, 50 S. Ct. 367, 1 C.B. 228 (1930), the Court, interpreting a predecessor to § 6502, held that the limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs "the extent of time for the enforcement of the tax liability," id.,281 U.S. 489, 495, 74 L. Ed. 984, 50 S.Ct. 367.  In other words, the Court held that the statute of limitations attached to the debt as a whole.  The basis of the liability in Updike was a tax imposed on the corporation, and the Court held that the same limitations period applied in a suit to collect the tax from the corporation as in a suit to collect the tax from the derivatively liable transferee.  Id.,281 U.S. 489, 494-496, 74 L. Ed. 984, 50 S. Ct. 367.  See also United States v. Wright, 57 F.3d 561, 563 (CA7 1995) (holding that, based on Updike's principle of "all-for-one, one-for-all," the statute of limitations governs the debt as a whole). 

Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for payment of the taxpayer's debt.  The consequences of the assessment--in this case the extension of the statute of limitations for collection of the debt--attach to the tax debt without reference to the special circumstances of the secondarily liable parties. 

 In this case, the tax was properly assessed against the Partnership, thereby extending the statute of limitations for collection of the debt.  The United States now timely  seeks to collect that debt in judicial proceedings against respondents. 5 The Court of Appeals also held that the claims were barred by California partnership law, which requires a creditor first to obtain a judgment against a partnership before holding the partners liable for the partnership's debt.  314 F.3d 336, 344 (CA9 2002).  When respondents filed for bankruptcy, an automatic stay barred the Government from bringing suit outside the Bankruptcy Court to enforce respondents' secondary liability.  11 U.S.C. § 362(a)(1) [11 USCS § 362(a)(1)].  Respondents do not dispute, however, that the adjudication of a disputed claim satisfies California's requirement that there be a "judgment against a partner." Cal. Corp. Code Ann. § 16307(c) (Supp. 2004) Moreover, a claim is allowable in bankruptcy "whether or not such right is reduced to judgment." 11 U.S.C. § 101(5)(A) [11 USCS § 101(5)(A)]. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 

 It is so ordered.
